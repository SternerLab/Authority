10.2307/1562612| A survey of the herpetofauna of Volcn Tacan on the southern Mexico-Guatemala border was conducted in the summer of 1963. Collections were made at 2000, 4000, 7000 and 12,000 feet. Fifteen of the 19 species of snakes collected were found at low to moderate elevations and all of these showed the expected continuity between populations from the Pacific versants of Chiapas and Guatemala previously collected. Two of the species exhibited clinal variation in scale counts: Drymobius margaritiferus occidentalis and Ninia sebae punctulata. The latter subspecies was redefined on the basis of dorsal body banding and is to be distinguished from N. s. sebae by the lack of bands or, if banded, by only a part of the dorsal surface being banded, and by a narrower distance between bands (one to two scales as opposed to three or four scales). Three species, Drymobius chloroticus, Geophis cancellatus and Trimetopon hannsteini, were found at moderate to intermediate elevations. The Geophis represents the third reported specimen of the species and the Trimetopon is the first reported specimen of this genus in Mexico. Rhadinea lachrymans was collected at 7000 feet and represents an intermediate population between the previously recorded populations from Mount Ovando, Chiapas, and Volcn Tajumulco, Guatemala. Micrurus nigrocinctus ovandoensis is reduced to a junior synonym of M. n. zunilensis. 
10.2307/1562589|Pennsylvania populations of the Eastern Hognose Snake, Heterodon platyrhinos, represent three distinct stocks which have entered the state by three distinct routes. The eastern populations, east of the Allegheny Front, have moved up the broad valleys of the larger rivers and the inter-mountain valleys of the Ridge and Valley Section from the south. The south-western Pennsylvania populations represent a second route of dispersal: up the Ohio-Allegheny river valleys from the west and south. The population of Presque Isle in Lake Erie was derived by a third and probably completely separate means of dispersal, the details of which remain unclear.
10.2307/1562610|Four species of reptiles have been collected recently on the island of Navassa between Jamaica and Hispaniola: Aristelliger cochranae, Sphaerodactylus becki, Anolis longiceps, and Diploglossus costatus badius. Four other species which presumably occurred on the island have either not been recently collected or are presumed extinct: Cyclura cornuta nigerrima, Leiocephalus eremitus, Typhlops sulcata, and Tropidophis melanurus bucculentus. Six other species have been reported from the island, but are regarded as not having been collected there originally. A detailed discussion of the herpetofauna is given, with pertinent comparisons of each of the Navassa forms with relatives on adjacent Greater Antillean islands, and some nomenclatorial changes are made. The fauna and flora of Navassa is briefly discussed, and comparisons of the origin of the Navassa reptiles are made with those of Isla Mona between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. The herpetofauna of Navassa has its closest affinities with that of Hispaniola, but two forms are closely related to Cuban species, and none shows a relationship to species on Jamaica.
10.2307/1562609|Five species of desmognathine salamanders are known to occur in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park: Desmognathus monticola, D. ochrophaeus carolinensis, D. quadramaculatus, D. wrighti, and Leurognathus marmoratus. In addition, Desmognathus aeneus is known to occur within eight miles of the Park. It is possible that Desmognathus fuscus enters the Park at lower elevations along the larger streams, but it is not widespread in the Park as previously reported. In terms of habitat and altitudinal variability, Desmognathus ochrophaeus carolinensis appears to be the most ubiquitous of the species discussed, and D. wrighti the most restricted.
10.2307/1562620|Frederic Ward Putnam (1839-1915) at an early age began the study of vertebrates found near his home and while still a boy was active in the Museum of the Essex Institute. He was trained under Louis Agassiz, and in 1864 became Curator of Vertebrates at the Essex Institute and four years later Director of the Museum of the Peabody Academy of Science. Until 1875 he was a zoologist with a special interest in fishes and reptiles. After that date he turned to American archaeology as a profession, but retained an interest in the lower vertebrates for the rest of his life. Excerpts from his diaries and his correspondence illuminate his acquaintance and work with Agassiz, his role in the naming of a new species, Bufo fowleri, and several selected incidents of herpetological interest in which Putnam was particularly interested.
10.2307/1562588| The polymorphic species Lacerta saxicola Eversmann forms 19 distinct forms in the Caucasus, four of which (armeniaca, dahli, rostombekovi, and unisexualis) are devoid of males and normally reproduce parthenogenetically. These parthenogenetic forms inhabit the mountains on the periphery of the range of the normal bisexual form, L. s. defilippii, thus suggesting a case of geographic parthenogenesis. Since the populations of parthenogenetic lizards are virtually devoid of males, the application of geographic and physiological species criteria to them is a matter of some difficulty. A discussion of this situation with regard to the problem of so-called "agamic species" enables us to regard the parthenogenetic relatives of L. saxicola as distinct species rather than subspecies, and these forms are raised to that rank. The parthenogenetic form of L. s. defilippii is described as a separate species (L. unisexualis). Cytological studies have shown that parthenogenetic species of Rock Lizards are diploid (2n = 38) and that oogenesis proceeds similarly in parthenogenetic and bisexual forms up to the second meiotic division. In regions of sympatry the parthenogenetic and bisexual forms occasionally produce natural hybrids, resulting in sterile triploid (3n = 57) females, the sterility of which is caused by anomalies in the development and structure of the gonads. In the eggs laid by parthenogenetic females, peculiar abnormal embryos, which commonly die in an early stage of incubation, are often developed. Most of them prove to be males, the development of which stops approximately in the middle of incubation. There is reason to suppose that the transition of Rock Lizards to parthenogenesis is associated with natural interspecific hybridization, which in turn favors unisexual reproduction. This tendency could be realized under the influence of selection and apparently took place in forest refuges during Quaternary glaciation of the Caucasus. The transition of Rock Lizards to unisexual reproduction is shown to be accompanied by the appearance of morphologically and biologically distinct species. Natural parthenogenesis may thus be regarded as one of the factors of speciation in the L. saxicola group. /// 1.

10.2307/1562611| Geophis sallaei russatus ssp. nov. is described from a single specimen from La Concepcin, near Putla, Oaxaca, and is regarded as different from G. s. sallaei on the basis of dorsal coloration (brick red with irregular, short, black transverse bars, as opposed to a uniform brown or black) and supposed regional endemism with G. s. sallaei presumably being confined to the Sierra de Miahuatln.
