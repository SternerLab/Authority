42786320|K. Schumann's treatment is considered preferable to that of Britton & Rose as a basis for the classification of the North American species of Echinocactus Link & Otto sensu lato. The amplification of Ferocactus B. & R. to correspond broadly with Echinocactus subg. Ancistrocactus K. Schum. is proposed. New combinations are made at subgeneric and sectional rank and for 13 species transferred from Ancistrocactus, Coloradoa, Sclerocactus and Thelocactus. Nomenclatural notes are appended on three untenable names (Ferocactus acanthodes, F. etnoryi and F. crassihamatus).
42786896|A new diploid species of Aloe, A. morijensis, is described from south-west Kenya. It occurs at the centre of distribution of the tetraploid shrubby species of East Africa, and the possibility that it is the ancestor of the group is discussed. A further tetraploid species, A. cheranganiensis, is described from the Mount Moropus region of the Chcrangani Hills in western Kenya.
42786291|Echinofossulocactus names of recent usage are reviewed and a ruthless attitude is adopted with regard to their usefulness. Of the 36 validly published epithets, 11 are considered to be of no value, while a further 5 are of uncertain status. The names E. coptonogonus, E. crispatus, E. multicostatus, E. phyllacanthus, E. sulphureus and E. vaupelianus are held as representing the majority of the distinctive taxa belonging in the genus. The remainder are referred, as probable synonyms, to the above.
