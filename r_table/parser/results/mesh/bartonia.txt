41610105|We examined effects of herbivore exclosures on non-native Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara and Grande, and on the native herb layer, to determine if selective herbivory by mammals (particularly white-tailed deer) may facilitate A. petiolata invasion. The study was done from 1996 to 2000, in one urban forest without deer (New York Botanical Garden Forest), and two suburban forests (Kitchawan Preserve and Mt. Holly Sanctuary), both in a region with > 50 deer km. Each forest had four pairs of 4-m plots, with one of each pair caged to exclude deer. No significant differences developed in percent cover of native plants between uncaged and caged plots. At Mt. Holly, A. petiolata cover in caged plots averaged nearly twice its cover in uncaged plots, with a similar trend at Kitchawan but not at NYBG. Individual A. petiolata size in caged plots at Mt. Holly averaged more than three times that in uncaged plots. Herbivory on A. petiolata was 30 to 40 times more frequent in uncaged plots in both forests with deer, but only one plant showed herbivory at NYBG. We attribute A. petiolata cover and size differences between caged and uncaged plots to deer herbivory, noting that Mt. Holly appeared most heavily browsed. We suggest that interactions between deer and invasive species could change as densities of both increase, and that these interactions should be considered in forest management.
41610126|The oldest stand of shortleaf pine, Pinus echinata, on the Piedmont of North Carolina  a stand established in ca. 1810 to 1837 and occupying a 1.9 ha site at the Duke Forest, Durham  was sampled for trees with a diameter at breast height greater than 7.6 cm. in sixteen 10 m. x 10 m. quadrats. P. echinata, an important successional species in the region, is the dominant species with an importance value of 79, and accounts for 46.5% of the basal area of all trees sampled at the site. From comparisons with data collected at the same site 63 years earlier and with other mixed shortleaf pine hardwoood stands of ages 21,31,56 and 83 years, the overall successional trend of conifers as a group being replaced by hardwoods is clear even though P. echinata remains the dominant species at this site.
41610085|The effects of achene weight and orientation (up, horizontal, or down) on total germination or the time taken to germinate were examined among Doellingeria umbellata var. umbellata, Symphyotrichum novae-angliae, and S. puniceum. Achenes of S. novae-angliae and D. umbellata that germinated were on average heavier than were those that did not germinate. All achenes of S. puniceum germinated irrespective of treatment or size. Achenes of all species germinated three to four times more quickly in agar medium trials, irrespective of orientation, than in filter-paper trials. Species varied in response to germination media: a greater proportion of D. umbellata var. umbellata achenes germinated on agar than on filter paper; more S. novae-angliae germinated on filter paper; and germination of S. puniceum was similar in both. Total germination was not affected by orientation for any species. Achene weight was not correlated with the time taken to germinate for either S. puniceum or D. umbellata, irrespective of orientation. In contrast, for S. novae-angliae the time to germinate was negatively correlated with achene weight regardless of orientation. However, achenes of S. novaeangliae oriented in the up position took significantly longer to germinate than did those in the horizontal or down positions. The results of this study indicate that differential allocation of resources occurs in the three commonly co-occurring, weedy aster species and that germination success in them may or may not be related to these allocations, genetic factors, or environmental conditions, but not orientation.
41610125|Although riparian and stream habitats are closely linked systems, the ability of the riparian plant community to serve as a consistent and strong predictor of the health of the adjacent instream community has not been empirically explored. We evaluated the efficacy of the Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQAI) to predict the condition of both mainstem and headwater aquatic sites along Penns Creek, a high gradient coldwater stream in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province of central Pennsylvania. We also used Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis to evaluate the use of the FQAI in combination with additional landscape and local metrics to determine broad categories of condition for aquatic habitat. Riparian and instream data were collected at 17 sites throughout the upper Penns Creek watershed. Sites were selected to incorporate a range of land uses from forested to agricultural lands and urban/suburban cover, as well as a range of potential chemical properties. Riparian condition followed a pattern predictable for sites in the Ridge and Valley with high quality sites occurring in forested watersheds and low quality sites within agricultural and urban settings. This pattern was mirrored by aquatic insect metrics for headwater streams, but not for sites within the mainstem portion of Penns Creek. Along the mainstem of the creek, floristic quality increased as the stream flowed from the agriculturally-dominated Penns Valley into Bald Eagle State Forest; however, taxonomic richness and EPT diversity were low at Penns Valley sites and remained low over this same distance despite improvement in the riparian corridor. The lack of a consistent relationship between FQAI and aquatic metrics indicated that response is scale-dependent: floristic quality is more sensitive to localized changes in riparian condition, while instream metrics are responsive to changes in the watershed as a whole. Both landscape and local metrics were useful in partitioning sites into broad condition categories. Using % forest, FQAI, and Habitat Assessment scores as predictor variables, CART defined four condition categories for the upper Penns Creek watershed, corresponding to superior, high, moderate, and low quality sites. Since streams are systems that operate over a range of spatial scales, this approach, which uses multiple metrics representing different hierarchical levels, may be more tenable. The use of both landscape-level and local metrics appears necessary to ensure a comprehensive assessment of stream condition and supports EPA's vision of a watershed approach for the protection and management of surface and groundwater resources.
41610089|Coastal plain ponds on the Delmarva Peninsula are ecologically unique wetlands that support a diverse assemblage of plant species and are a prominent part of the peninsula's natural heritage. As such, conservation of these wetlands is critical in helping to maintain biodiversity on Delmarva. Very little has been published regarding the vegetation associated with Delmarva coastal plain ponds, both in terms of the natural community types and the individual plant species that are closely associated with them. This paper provides a general description of the natural community types, or vegetation zones, found in Delmarva coastal plain ponds and focuses on the flora of the most diverse vegetation zone, the herbaceous community. Particular attention is given to the rare and uncommon flora of these wetlands. The summary of the flora of herbaceous communities in Delmarva coastal plain ponds provides strong evidence regarding their importance for biodiversity conservation on the peninsula.
41955392|This paper reports the first record of the mycorrhizal status of the state-endangered plant Rhynchospora knieskernii (Knieskern's beaked sedge, formerly KnieskerrTs beaked rush). Root samples of this plant were obtained from two locations in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Roots from one site had no mycorrhizal colonization, whereas roots from the second site were weakly colonized by hyphae and arbuscules, sparse vesicles and some spores. It is suggested that this species is facultatively mycorrhizal.
41955391|Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) is found in remnant populations in the Carolinas. This study focused on microhabitat characteristics of its ecology. Quadrats (1m  1m; n=362) were sampled from eight A. gerardii population sites across the Carolinas for associated species, stem counts and percent cover of A. gerardii, and total percent cover of all species. For each population soil samples were collected at random in three quadrats where A. gerardii was present and three where it was absent (n=48). A total of 190 associated taxa were identified. Andropogon gerardii stem counts were higher in quadrats with either Lespedeza cuneata, Rubus argutus, Vitis rotundifolia, and Fraxinus sp. at two or more sites, while A. gerardii stem counts were less in quadrats with Dichanthelium scoparium for two sites. Soil data across all study sites indicated significantly higher pH and levels of available magnesium, manganese, and boron in quadrats where A. gerardii occurred. However, the levels of available copper were higher in quadrats without A. gerardii. The total plant cover in quadrats with A. gerardii was 73.2% (s. d. 22.6%), compared to 68.5% (s. d. 24.4%) without A. gerardii. The clonal growth of A. gerardii ramets is best characterized as a "phalanx-like" compared to a "guerrilla-like" foraging strategy.
43893668|Recent field, herbarium and literature research has resulted in 302 changes (202 additions, 11 deletions, 67 alterations to abundance or nativity status, 22 name changes) to the checklist of vascular plants of Cumberland County published in 1989 (Bartonia 55: 25-39). For the additions, 116 represent non-native species and 82 are native species (4 other additions are hybrids). The total number of species reported from the county is 1531, 1094 of which are native and 437 are non-native. A summary is provided for rare taxa in the county with 205 being reported, of which 34 are new to the county (i.e., not on the 1989 list); 23 species previously reported as historical are now known to be extant. A summary is also provided for invasive species in the county, with 93 species being reported as invasive or potentially invasive in New Jersey (Category 1 or Category 2), Delaware, New York or Pennnsylvania, with 33 of these being new to the county.
41610086|In 1912, Witmer Stone's landmark work on the plants of southern New Jersey was published. This work is the only floristic treatment for southern New Jersey and it continues to be used today. However, its use is made difficult by the nomenclature, which included elements of the 1905 International Code of Zoological Nomenclature and the defunct American (Brittonian) code of botanical nomenclature. As a result, many of the names used by Stone are no longer in current use. Stone's authorship citations were often incomplete and confusing because he cited only basionym authors even for combinations and inconsistently used parentheses to indicate basionym authors in combinations. Also Stone did not clearly indicate the rank of the 60 trinomials he used. For this paper, all names employed by Stone in The Plants of Southern New Jersey have been reviewed, and it is concluded that Stone's trinomials should be regarded as validly published, unranked names. The 19 nomenclatural innovations published by Stone in The Plants of Southern New Jersey are discussed. A table comparing all of the accepted names in Stone's manuals with those in two currently used manuals is available from the author upon request.
44089926|Recent field work has revealed many new additions to the floras of Maryland and Delaware. We report 16 state records for Delaware and 13 state records for Maryland. Two of the taxa, Ludwigia hexapetala and Cenchruspurpurascens, are records for both States. We also report two rediscoveries for Maryland, Gaylussacia dumosa and Coreopsis rosea.
41610108|We compiled information on the medicinal and pharmacological activity of each of the 177 Lewis and Clark Herbarium (LCH) plant species, representing 129 genera, from ethnobotanical and current biomedical research literature. Medicinal uses by Native American groups have been documented for 123 species (approximately 69%) in 83 genera. We found research studies reporting pharmacological activity for only 26 (15%) of the species, although we also found reports of pharmacological activity for other species worldwide in 80 of the genera represented in the LCH. The disparity between the number of LCH species used in traditional American Indian medicine and the number that have undergone modern pharmacological evaluation suggests that future research may turn up additional compounds of use to modern medicine from Lewis and Clark's discoveries.
44089928|This paper presents for the first time a complete translation from Latin to English of the introduction to Johannes Baptista von Albertini and Lewis David von Schweinitz's Conspectus fungorum in Lusatiae superioris agro Nieskiensi crescentium. E methodo Persooniana. The Conspectus, published in 1805, is a seminal work in mycology and documents 1130 fungi that grew in an area that is now eastern Germany and western Poland. It includes descriptions of the habitats in which these fungi are found and illustrations of scores of newly described taxa of fungi. A translation of the text into English (or into any other vernacular, for that matter) has been heretofore unavailable, thus limiting a full appreciation of the book. With this annotated translation of the introduction we hope to facilitate the use of this work to provide its insights into early 19th century European biodiversity, the ecological preferences of the fungi discussed, taxonomic concepts of fungal biology prevalent in the early 19th century, and an historical perspective regarding fungal biology.
44089927|We provide a checklist of native and non-native plants growing within a region of Salem County described as Burden Hill Forest. This list is the result of more than a dozen surveys that we conducted between 2001 and 2012. 530 distinct taxa (106 families, 303 genera, 520 species, and 10 varieties) were identified within the forests and meadows found between the villages of Alloway and Stow Creek. Included are habitat descriptions and site locations for plants of special interest. A landscape description is provided that distinguishes this forest and its flora from other New Jersey Outer Coastal Plain forests.
41610134|A survey of vascular plants of the Delaware Water Gap national Recreation Area in New Jersey and Pennsylvania was conducted. A total of 1,271 species (in 154 families and 546 genera) were identified, with 1,055 species being native to the region. Overviews are also provided on vegetational history, current vegetational communities, and management of invasive species.
41610084|We surveyed trees (dbh > 10.0 cm), saplings (> 140 cm tall to dbh  10.0 cm), seedlings/sprouts (11 to 140 cm tall) and shrubs of a hemlock-mixed northern hardwoods forest at Lacawac Sanctuary in northeastern Pennsylvania. The canopy (24 species, 490.5 stems ha) was dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) with red maple (Acer rubrum) and red oak (Quercus rubra) as subdominants. Other canopy trees, in descending order of importance, were chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), white pine (Pinus strobus) and sweet birch (Betula lenta). The sapling stratum (22 species, 239.5 stems ha) was dominated by T. canadensis with F. grandifolia, A. rubrum and A. saccharum as subdominants. Oak saplings were rare (Q. rubra) or absent (Q. prinus). Sapling density was only 49% that of canopy density. Small saplings (0.1 to 2.5 cm dbh) were very sparse (14.0 stems ha) and 82% were T. canadensis or F. grandifolia. The seedling/sprout layer (23 species, 444 stems ha) was dominated by F. grandifolia (236 stems ha), which occurred solely as root suckers. Only 6% of seedlings/sprouts (24.7 stems ha) were > 30 cm tall, the majority of which were F. grandifolia (18.6 stems ha) and T. canadensis (4.8 stems ha). Hence, the Lacawac Sanctuary forest was almost devoid of woody stems from 31 cm tall to 2.5 cm dbh, exhibiting much lower densities than most other eastern U.S. forests, either second-growth or old-growth, that we surveyed. Only forests with very high densities of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) had comparably low seedling and sapling densities.
43893669|Linking historic herbarium collections with current geospatial temporal floristic and phenological data is crucial for environmental change research and education. The floristic and phenological (flowering) study of Lake Issaqueena in Pickens County, SC, conducted by William Pamplin in 1970-1971 was reinvestigated in 2011-2012 using the Carolina Vegetative Survey (CVS) natural community sampling methods and photo documentation using a GPS-enabled camera to determine floristic and phenological changes for this site during the forty years separating these two studies. Phenological events (flowering) were recorded via photographs taken by a GPS-enabled camera on a monthly basis. Photographs were downloaded and organized by sampling date in Picasa 3 web albums and stored in a project Google website. Precipitation in 1970, 2011 and 2012 was below the long-term average and this combined with higher than average air temperature impacted drought severity in the area. Comparison of phenologies indicated 269 plant species blooming in 1970-1971 compared to 203 plants blooming in 2011-2012, and 149 common plant species blooming in both study periods. The blooming period was 11 months in 2011-2012 compared to 8 months in 1970-1971. A majority of plants were blooming earlier and longer in 2011-2012 than in 1970-1971. Repeat photography and data storage using website have a great potential to enhance phenological research by linking it to historical herbarium collections.
43233854|Bostwick Forest may be one of the largest and oldest Quercs-dominated, old-growth coastal forests in the northeastern United States. The forest is located on Gardiners Island, New York, and has been in the possession of the Gardiner family since 1639. The forest was sampled using seventy points by the point-centered quarter method to determine species composition and dominance. Quercus alba (white oak) and Q. velutina (black oak) were co-dominant and comprised approximately two thirds of the trees in the forest. Tree saplings, shrubs, and lianas were sampled in fifty 2  4 m quadrats, while tree seedlings were sampled in fifty 1 m quadrats. No Quercus spp. seedlings or saplings were observed in the 50 quadrats due to deer browse by an overabundant whitetailed deer population on the island.
41955393|Systematic field surveys were conducted in ten years from 2001 to 2011 for six rare beach plant species in New Jersey, including the federally-listed (Threatened) plant species, Amaranthus pumilus (seabeach amaranth), and five other rare beach plant species (Polygonum glaucum, Honckenya peploides var. robusta, Sesuvium maritimum, Oenothera humifusa, Glaux maritima). Surveys covered all 130 miles of sandy ocean beaches in New Jersey, and an additional 15 miles of habitat on the Raritan and Delaware Bays. A total of 77 locations were observed for five of the six species (no G. maritima were found) in four out of five coastal counties, compared to 89 historical locations in five counties from 200 years of historical records. Field surveys found populations in 44 (49%) of 89 historical locations; nine of these were last observed in the 1800s, 13 in 1900-1979, and 22 in 1980-2000. The 33 de novo discoveries effectively increased the total known locations of these rare beach plant species in New Jersey by 37%. Repeated surveys were found to be essential to documenting populations in these dynamic beach ecosystems, with 4-7 survey years required to capture 90% of found populations. Only three locations in New Jersey contained the majority of the study species in the majority of years, all of which had 8-10 miles of contiguous habitat relatively protected from coastal development, hard shoreline stabilization, and incompatible land uses (mechanical beach raking and/or off-road vehicles). A discussion is provided on the distribution and abundance of populations and threats to each of these species in New Jersey. Also discussed is the utility and feasibility of comprehensive, systematic surveys of habitat for rare beach plant species to effectively determine their status and distribution and changes over time.
41610088|Leo Lesquereux's Coal Flora has long been considered the basis for American Carboniferous paleobotany and is a monument to his idominable will to succeed under trying conditions. Throughout the four volumes that make up the Coal Flora, 247 new species are introduced. The type specimens upon which these species are based are known to be scattered throughout the collections of numerous institutions. A catalogue of these specimens has never been compiled although one was begun by Watt in 1974. This paper provides, for the first time, a catalogue of the type specimens of all of the Coal Flora taxa.
41610107|Ruellia is a plant genus of conservation concern in Pennsylvania. I examined the current status of R. humilis Nutt. and R. strepens L. in the state by conducting surveys to assess the stability of populations since their 1984 listing by the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory. Roughly half of the historically occurring populations are extant and half are extirpated or are no longer apparent. I attempted to characterize genetic diversity levels within and between these populations with allozyme assays, but results were inconclusive.
41610124|We conducted a comprehensive rare plant survey at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range (WGR), Burlington County, New Jersey from July 2004 through August 2006. Although areas outside the Range boundary have a long history of botanical exploration, little information on rare plant occurrences, habitats and distribution exists for WGR. The landscape at WGR is a mosaic of upland and lowland habitats that include sections of the East Pine Plains and the Oswego River Lowlands (ORL). Frequent anthropogenic disturbance (mechanical and prescribed burning) in military target zones provides suitable habitat for several early successional species, while less disturbed buffer zones support habitat for late successional species. Temporal and spatial habitat heterogeneity influences diverse plant assemblages at WGR, where we have documented the occurrences of 32 rare species including large, previously unreported populations of Calamovilfa brevipilis, Corema conradii, Gentiana autumnalis, Lobelia canbyi, Muhlenbergia torreyana, Narthecium americanum, Panicum wrightianum, Rhynchospora knieskernii and small pockets of Calamagrostis pickeringii. Although the greatest density of plant populations occurred in the ORL, 60% of the populations throughout WGR were associated with some level of anthropogenic disturbance. Natural resource management at WGR appears to successfully protect, promote and conserve habitat for rare plants concurrent with the military mission.
41610120|The cryptogamic herbarium of Lewis David von Schweinitz is among the oldest in North America and contains type material, not only of the majority of names published by him, but also of names published by his contemporaries with whom he corresponded. Job B. Ellis (although not one of Schweinitz's contemporaries) published seven new species based on material in the Schweinitz herbarium. The types of some of these taxa have only recently been rediscovered during curation by the author and are discussed here for the first time since their publication in 1895. The types of several other species named in the same 1895 publication by Ellis have not yet been located in the herbarium the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.
41610132|Based on a survey of herbarium collections, three species of hornworts (Anthocerotophyta) and ninety-three species of liverworts (Marchantiophyta) are know to have grown in New Jersey. More than half of these records are based on collections more than 50 years old. Eighteen species of liverworts are potentially rare.
43233851|New Jersey holds unique ecological implications for the flora of North America, containing habitats from the coastal zone to the inland highlands, and as a transition zone between the more boreal and austral zones to the north and south, respectively. Presented here are identification keys and descriptions of the genera and species of Gentianaceae (Asteridae: Gentianales) that are native to or naturalized in the state of New Jersey, USA. This information has been prepared for the Flora of New Jersey Project, a collaborative endeavor among botanists to provide modern nomenclature, identification, descriptions, distribution, abundance, and phenology data for all vascular plant species occurring naturally within the state. Keys to all genera and species are included, along with descriptions and morphological, ecological, distributional, and conservation information. These data were gathered from more than 1,650 herbarium specimens at the New York Botanical Garden (NY), the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (BKL), the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (PH), and the Chrysler Herbarium of Rutgers University (CHRB). In total, eight genera and 19 species are treated, including the first voucher-documented record for Schenkia spicata (L.) G. Mans., in New Jersey.
41610106|Three species of Ophioglossum are known from Pennsylvania. The distribution of Ophioglossum vulgatum Linnaeus and Ophioglossum pusillum Rafinesque is related to the glacial boundary in Pennsylvania. Ophioglossum engelmannii Prantl is known from only one county. Until this report, O. vulgatum was considered extirpated in the state. The status of O. pusillum should be reassessed, and O. engelmannii is endangered. A key to the species is provided.
41610118|A summary is presented of the vascular flora of the Kinzua Quality Deer Cooperative, located in McKean County, Pennsylvania, in the Allegheny National Forest (66%) and on adjacent private and public lands (34%). The flora is based on observations and collections made between May and August, 2001 and 2003. In total, 305 species in 181 genera and 66 families were recorded in the 30,628-ha study area. The largest families are Cyperaceae (38 species), Poaceae (34 species), and Asteraceae (22 species) and the largest genera are Carex (35 species), Viola (7 species), and Aster sensu lato (7 species). Of all taxa recorded, 15% are non-native. An annotated species list, including the frequency of occurrence, growth form, whether native to Pennsylvania, and regional wetland status for each taxon, is included as an appendix. This list documents the baseline floristic conditions of an area that will be monitored over ten years as land managers attempt to mitigate the impacts of white-tailed deer on forest health.
43233853|Xyris chapmanii E. L. Bridges & Orzell has recently been discovered extant in the Pine Barren region of southern New Jersey. Information substantiating this find and a key differentiating other local Xyris species is provided. Additionally, a history of the species is provided along with a species description, floristic composition, habitat, associated species, current range, and current status. Further discussion highlights historical collections originally misidentified and deposited in herbaria but later correctly identified and annotated by James W. Horn in 2009. The biogeographic significance of X. chapmanii in New Jersey is also discussed.
43233852|Presented here are generic and specific nomenclature, typifications, and taxonomic updates on all of the species of Gentianaceae (Asteridae: Gentianales) occurring naturally in the state of New Jersey, U. S. A. Complete synonymy is provided (except for formae), along with all known information on typifications. A type is designated for Erythraea sect. Spicaria Griseb.; neotypes are designated for Gentiana clausa Raf., G. linearis Froel., and G. ochroleuca Froel.; and lectotypes are designated for Chironia gracilis Michx., G paniculata Michx., Diploma angustifolia Raf., Gentiana andrewsii var. intermedia Kusn., G. elliottii var. parvifolia Chapm., G. incarnata Sims, G. intermedia Sims, G. pseudopneumonanthe Schult., and Sabatia stellaris Pursh. The typification of Centaurium pulchellum (Sw.) Hayek ex Hand.-Mazz. et al. is clarified.
41610092|The vascular flora of Statue of Liberty National Monument, a 4.86 hectare island in New York Harbor, consists of 97 species in 82 genera and 40 familes. The largest families in the flora are the Asteraceae (18 species) and Poaceae (16 species). Together these familia comprise 34% of the flora. Non-native species, 65% of the flora, are a major component of the natural vegetation. A list of the 97 species of vascular plants is included in an appendix.
41610119|Over three years beginning in 1884, amateur botanists John and Harvey Ruth conducted a vascular plant species inventory of Wykers Island, now known as Lynn Island, in the Delaware River, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. This is one of the earliest known detailed descriptions of native plant communities in the state. It is a unique "snapshot" of the species composition of a riverine floodplain from a time before most of the native plant communities on riverine floodplains in the region were greatly altered by invasive plants and plant pathogens introduced from Eurasia. The Ruths' accounts are presented verbatim. An appendix lists the 197 species identified by them, with updated nomenclature, together with the 155 taxa found in a survey at the same site in 1992, which included only 51 of the species encountered by the Ruths.
41610135|Vegetational succession of an abandoned cornfield on the campus of West Chester University was studied for 34 years from 1967-2000. The succession followed three stages involving 1) dominance by herbaceous annuals, 2.) dominance by herbaceous perennials and 3) dominance by woody plants. Specific details for these three stages are provided.
44089931|The history of the word "Philadelphia" is reviewed. Using available nomenclatural indices, searches were conducted for scientific names that honor Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Thirteen species names of flowering plants were identified as being toponyms for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The nomenclature and taxonomy of these were reviewed and it was determined that only four, Erigeron philadelphicus, Lilium philadelphicum, Panicum philadelphicum, and Physalis philadelphica, are currently accepted, the other nine either being synonyms or not validly published and unavailable. One accepted name of an alga (diatom), Cymbella philadelphica, is a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania toponym. From a preliminary review of the zoological literature it was determined that twenty names of animals are likely toponyms for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with twelve (one bee, two beetles, three birds, one fish, two flies, one spider, one wasp, and one worm) in current use, the other eight (all flies) being synonyms. Numerous names were identified that can be mistakenly identified as honoring Philadelphia, Pennsylvania but actually honor another Philadelphia or refer to the plant genus Philadelphus L., which was not named in honor of Philadelphia. In total, thirty-four Philadelphia toponyms have been identified in biological nomenclature, of which seventeen are in current use.
41610117|Flowers of Sarracenia alata are not protandrous, confirmed by benzidine staining of stigmas for receptivity. Bomhus bimaculatus is the primary pollinator in Louisiana, and the flowers are adapted to scrape adherent pollen from the dorsal wing surfaces as well as the thoracic and abdominal pile. The unique structure of the flower suggests adaptation for pollination when the bee exits the flower rather than enters, arguing for self-pollination rather than xenogamy.
44089929|Herteliana schuyleriana is described as new to science based on collections from throughout the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. Taxonomic placement is inferred from molecular phylogenic analysis of mtSSU sequence data that recovered the taxon as sister to the type species of Herteliana, H. gagei, and strongly supported these taxa as embedded within the Squamarinaceae. The new species is characterized by its occurrence on non-calcareous shaded rocks in inland forested habitats (vs. exposed maritime oceanic habitats), its greenish-blue crustose thallus, presence of abundant blastidia on the thallus surface, frequent sterility, and by the production of roccellic/angardianic acid together with occasional trace amounts of psoromic acid as accessories to atranorin.
41610133|A summary of three biologically significant lichen habitats found in the northeastern counties of Pennsylvania is presented.
41610127|An overview is provided on the specimens collected by John Bartram in the wild and those collected at Bartram's (Carr's) Garden. In this study, material collected from Bartram's Garden (mostly from the 1820s and 1830s) and housed at the William Darlington Herbarium (DWC) at West Chester University was examined. Only 55 specimens cite a collector, 48 of these indicate John Bartam Carr as collector. Of the 176 specimens (on 123 herbarium sheets) examined, 118-128 were determined to have been collected from Bartram's Garden, the exact number being uncertain due to vague or inconsistent labeling. All but one of the 176 specimens was able to be identified to species, with 96-102 species (in 52 families and 83 or 84 genera) definitively being collected from Bartram's Gardens. A table is provided of all species that were identified with selected synonymy. Further discussions on the nomenclature and taxonomy of some of the more problematic specimens are also provided. The material from DWC examined in this study represents the largest known herbarium collection from Bartram's Garden, documenting a number of species that occurred on the grounds during the Carr era. These specimens may also provide further insights into the interests and activities of John Bartram and the Carrs.
41610104|The Lewis and Clark expedition produced a series of journals of more than one million words, and in the two centuries since the expedition in 1803 to 1806 a flood of books and articles has detailed their travels and travails. In this paper we explore a neglected portion of the expedition: the labels and notes associated with the Lewis and Clark Herbarium, a collection of 222 dried, pressed plants housed in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia herbarium (PH). We also comment on an additional 10 specimens of Lewis that reside at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. This residue of written records includes notes by Meriwether Lewis (primary plant collector on the expedition), Frederick Pursh (German botanist who first studied the plants), Thomas Meehan (Academy of Natural Sciences botanist who re-discovered the plants in Philadelphia after nearly a century of oblivion in storage), and several other nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first century botanists and other researchers who have found occasion to annotate the specimens. The notes reveal insights into the collection, curation, taxonomy, and research uses of the Lewis and Clark Herbarium during the 200 years since Lewis made his gatherings. Much remains to be learned from a closer study of this littleexamined part of the paper trail of Lewis and Clark.
41610087|The early nineteenth-century mycologist, Lewis David von Schweinitz, is known to have produced seven bound volumes of paintings of fungi; four of these are at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and one each are at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of Michigan, and the Farlow Herbarium at Harvard University. The volumes in Philadelphia and Chapel Hill together form a single set; the volume in Michigan and the volume at Harvard are not part of that set.
41610092|The vascular flora of Statue of Liberty National Monument, a 4.86 hectare island in New York Harbor, consists of 97 species in 82 genera and 40 familes. The largest families in the flora are the Asteraceae (18 species) and Poaceae (16 species). Together these familia comprise 34% of the flora. Non-native species, 65% of the flora, are a major component of the natural vegetation. A list of the 97 species of vascular plants is included in an appendix.
41610119|Over three years beginning in 1884, amateur botanists John and Harvey Ruth conducted a vascular plant species inventory of Wykers Island, now known as Lynn Island, in the Delaware River, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. This is one of the earliest known detailed descriptions of native plant communities in the state. It is a unique "snapshot" of the species composition of a riverine floodplain from a time before most of the native plant communities on riverine floodplains in the region were greatly altered by invasive plants and plant pathogens introduced from Eurasia. The Ruths' accounts are presented verbatim. An appendix lists the 197 species identified by them, with updated nomenclature, together with the 155 taxa found in a survey at the same site in 1992, which included only 51 of the species encountered by the Ruths.
41610135|Vegetational succession of an abandoned cornfield on the campus of West Chester University was studied for 34 years from 1967-2000. The succession followed three stages involving 1) dominance by herbaceous annuals, 2.) dominance by herbaceous perennials and 3) dominance by woody plants. Specific details for these three stages are provided.
44089931|The history of the word "Philadelphia" is reviewed. Using available nomenclatural indices, searches were conducted for scientific names that honor Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Thirteen species names of flowering plants were identified as being toponyms for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The nomenclature and taxonomy of these were reviewed and it was determined that only four, Erigeron philadelphicus, Lilium philadelphicum, Panicum philadelphicum, and Physalis philadelphica, are currently accepted, the other nine either being synonyms or not validly published and unavailable. One accepted name of an alga (diatom), Cymbella philadelphica, is a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania toponym. From a preliminary review of the zoological literature it was determined that twenty names of animals are likely toponyms for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with twelve (one bee, two beetles, three birds, one fish, two flies, one spider, one wasp, and one worm) in current use, the other eight (all flies) being synonyms. Numerous names were identified that can be mistakenly identified as honoring Philadelphia, Pennsylvania but actually honor another Philadelphia or refer to the plant genus Philadelphus L., which was not named in honor of Philadelphia. In total, thirty-four Philadelphia toponyms have been identified in biological nomenclature, of which seventeen are in current use.
41610117|Flowers of Sarracenia alata are not protandrous, confirmed by benzidine staining of stigmas for receptivity. Bomhus bimaculatus is the primary pollinator in Louisiana, and the flowers are adapted to scrape adherent pollen from the dorsal wing surfaces as well as the thoracic and abdominal pile. The unique structure of the flower suggests adaptation for pollination when the bee exits the flower rather than enters, arguing for self-pollination rather than xenogamy.
44089929|Herteliana schuyleriana is described as new to science based on collections from throughout the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. Taxonomic placement is inferred from molecular phylogenic analysis of mtSSU sequence data that recovered the taxon as sister to the type species of Herteliana, H. gagei, and strongly supported these taxa as embedded within the Squamarinaceae. The new species is characterized by its occurrence on non-calcareous shaded rocks in inland forested habitats (vs. exposed maritime oceanic habitats), its greenish-blue crustose thallus, presence of abundant blastidia on the thallus surface, frequent sterility, and by the production of roccellic/angardianic acid together with occasional trace amounts of psoromic acid as accessories to atranorin.
41610133|A summary of three biologically significant lichen habitats found in the northeastern counties of Pennsylvania is presented.
41610127|An overview is provided on the specimens collected by John Bartram in the wild and those collected at Bartram's (Carr's) Garden. In this study, material collected from Bartram's Garden (mostly from the 1820s and 1830s) and housed at the William Darlington Herbarium (DWC) at West Chester University was examined. Only 55 specimens cite a collector, 48 of these indicate John Bartam Carr as collector. Of the 176 specimens (on 123 herbarium sheets) examined, 118-128 were determined to have been collected from Bartram's Garden, the exact number being uncertain due to vague or inconsistent labeling. All but one of the 176 specimens was able to be identified to species, with 96-102 species (in 52 families and 83 or 84 genera) definitively being collected from Bartram's Gardens. A table is provided of all species that were identified with selected synonymy. Further discussions on the nomenclature and taxonomy of some of the more problematic specimens are also provided. The material from DWC examined in this study represents the largest known herbarium collection from Bartram's Garden, documenting a number of species that occurred on the grounds during the Carr era. These specimens may also provide further insights into the interests and activities of John Bartram and the Carrs.
