23375587|Great Basin National Park in east central Nevada encompasses most of the southern Snake Range including Wheeler Peak, which at 3980 m is the highest peak in the interior Great Basin. The original detailed surveys of the mammals of this region were made between 1929 and 1939 by field crews from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley. Between 2000 and 2003, we conducted additional field surveys of mammals in the park region in conjunction with the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program. Here, we provide a comprehensive report on the mammal fauna of the park and its immediate surroundings based on a review of historical records and recent field surveys. We document 48 native species of mammals in the region. In addition, there are 7 species that potentially occur within the park, 4 species of questionable occurrence, 6 species formerly present but now extirpated, and 4 nonnative species. We provide a short account for each species that summarizes ecology and local distribution and lists both historical and recent records of occurrence. Through comparative analysis of historical and recent data, we examine faunal changes in the park region during the past 70 years. Based on our results, we make some general recommendations for future resource management.
23375569|The birds of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, in southern Utah and northern Arizona, are documented, with information on abundance, distribution, ecology, residency status, and breeding status. In all, 316 species have been reported from the park since the first surveys in the region during the 1930s. Historical survey data from the pre-Glen Canyon Dam surveys are incorporated, as well as significant work done in the park since 1992. Breeding is documented for 87 species, including 82 native species and 5 exotic species. Many rare species are reported for the first time from this section of the state, and several recent range extensions are documented.
23375554|Southern Utah comprises 4 major physiographic divisions: the Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, Central Rocky Mountains, and Southern Rocky Mountains, which have been partitioned into faunal regions. We discuss the uniqueness of southern Utah and the amount of land set aside for recreation and preservation, and we encourage the study and preservation of its water resources. The stonefly (Plecoptera) fauna of 13 counties in southern Utah was surveyed. We found 58 species representing 34 genera and 8 families. Three new state records for Utah and many new county records for southern Utah are presented, along with a discussion of distribution patterns and faunal affinities of each species. Distribution patterns indicate a historical connection between the Sevier River and the Colorado drainage and a separation of faunal areas within the Central Rocky Mountains at boundaries between the Wasatch Mountains, Wasatch Plateau, and the Southern High Plateau. The uniqueness of the isolated Abajo and LaSal Mountains, the Virgin River valley, and other faunal areas in southern Utah is presented.
23375564|Herein we clarify the taxonomy of Fluminicola coloradensis Morrison (1940), which was described for populations in the Green River and Bonneville basins but has also been treated as restricted to the former watershed and conspecific with (currently unassigned) Snake River basin populations of Fluminicola hindsi sensu Taylor (1966). Bayesian analyses of DNA sequences from 2 mitochondrial genes congruently resolved F. coloradensis and Snake River basin populations of F. hindsi sensu Taylor as a strongly supported, shallowly structured clade. Haplotypes were extensively shared by Bonneville, Snake River and Green River populations; AMOVA did not detect significant variation among basins for either gene. Morphological variation was minor. Based on these results, we assign the Snake River basin populations to F. coloradensis. We attribute the limited differentiation of widely ranging F. coloradensis to its well-integrated habitats and to dispersal mediated by geologically recent drainage transfers. The broadly disjunct population in the Owyhee River drainage may be a product of translocation, as evidenced by detection of only the most common haplotypes in these snails. Our finding that F. coloradensis is more widely distributed than previously thought suggests that it may not require conservation attention rangewide, although some geographic subunits may be at risk. En este resumen clarificamos la taxonoma de Fluminicola coloradensis Morrison (1940), que se describi en el caso de las poblaciones de las cuencas del Green River y Bonneville, pero tambin se consider restringida a la anterior lnea divisoria y especie congnere (actualmente sin clasificar) de las poblaciones de Fluminicola hindsi sensu Taylor (1966) de la cuenca del Snake River. Los anlisis bayesianos de las secuencias de ADN de dos genes mitocondriales coincidieron en que las poblaciones de F. coloradensis y de Fluminicola hindsi sensu Taylor de la cuenca de Snake River constituyen un clado de estructura superficial y slida. Los haplotipos se encontraban en gran parte de las poblaciones de Bonneville, Snake River y Green River; el anlisis de varianza molecular (AMOVA) no detect variaciones significativas entre las cuencas en el caso de ningn gen y la variacin morfolgica no fue significativa. Segn estos resultados asignamos las poblaciones de la cuenca de Snake River a F. coloradensis. Atribuimos la poca diferenciacin de de la variada F. coloradensis, a sus hbitats bien integrados y a la intervencin de los flujos de desages recientes desde el punto de vista geolgico en la accin del agente dispersor. La existencia de una poblacin dispersa en el desage de Owyhee River puede ser consecuencia de la traslocacin, como lo demuestra el hecho de que se hayan detectado nicamente los haplotipos ms comunes en estos caracoles. Nuestro hallazgo de que F. coloradensis se encuentra en ms reas biogeogrficas de lo que suponamos sugiere que, aunque haya algunas subunidades que se encuentran en peligro, tal vez no sea necesario tomar medidas de conservacin en toda el rea.
23375560|Although lichens are a common feature in Wyoming, there has been no attempt to compile a statewide list of species since 1900. A number of surveys have been conducted in the state, especially in Yellowstone National Park and other federally managed parks and forests, though little attention has been given to lower-elevation regions of the state. The literature search conducted for this project yielded nearly 800 species names, which number was reduced to 608 currently accepted taxa. Collection locations and references are provided for each taxon, as are global ranks (conservation status, from NatureServe.org), and a brief discussion of some of the interesting results. Aunque los lquenes son tpicos en Wyoming, no ha habido intentos de compilar una lista de especies a nivel estatal desde 1900. Se han llevado a cabo una cantidad de estudios en el estado, especialmente en el Parque Nacional Yellowstone y en otros parques y bosques administrados por el estado, aunque se ha prestado poca atencin a las regiones de menor elevacin del estado. La investigacin bibliogrfica llevada a cabo para este proyecto result en aproximadamente 800 nombres de especies, que se redujeron a 608 taxa actualmente aceptados. Se proporcionan las localidades de colecta y referencias para cada taxn, as como tambin se proporcionan las categoras globales (estado de conservacin de NatureServe.org) y una breve discusin sobre algunos de los resultados interesantes.
23375586|We examined the biogeography of aquatic and semiaquatic Heteroptera (ASH) in the Grand Canyon (GC) ecoregion (GCE) on and adjacent to the southern Colorado Plateau. We report 89 ASH taxa in 86 species, 37 genera, and 14 families in the GCE, including 54 ASH taxa detected within or on the rims of GC and its major tributaries, a fauna 3.8-fold greater than previously reported. We tested 2 groups of biogeographic hypotheses to account for this high level of diversity, demonstrating an underlying pattern of mixed biogeographic affinity and strong landform-climate effects. Equal numbers of ASH taxa were derived from allochthonous (neotropical and nearctic) sources and autochthonous (range-centered) sources. A negative linear relationship existed between area-adjusted ASH taxon density and elevation, with more Mexican/neotropical taxa at low elevations and more nearctic taxa at higher elevations. While species richness was positively scale dependent, biogeographic landform impacts were unrelated or negatively related to spatial scale. The uplifted southern margin of the Colorado Plateau along the Mogollon Rim supported elevated ASH diversity as a function of ecotone effects and interprovincial basin connectivity. Barrier/filter effects were stronger than null, or refuge effects, and little endemism was detected in the GCE. Colonization history varied across elevation and in relation to landscape evolution. No reported GCE taxa have been extirpated, but 52.8% of the fauna occurred at 3 or fewer localities (primarily springs), sites that may be threatened by habitat alteration and climate change.
23375577|This paper presents descriptions, diagnoses, figures, and keys for 12 western North American species of the Holoarctic genus Isocapnia Banks. Complete known distributional records and a cladistic analysis are included for the Nearctic species. Isocapnia fraseri and I. missourii are synonymized with I. integra, and 3 new species are described: I. eichlini n. sp., I. palousa n. sp., and I. rickeri n. sp. Representatives of 5 of the 7 known Palearctic species of Isocapnia were examined and are compared with the Nearctic species. Type localities and distributional data are listed for all 7 Palearctic species.
23375555|The milliped fauna of California consists of 11 orders, 24 families, 83 genera, and 226 species and subspecies. A complete listing of these taxa and intergrades is provided, with published and new records from the state and type localities. Cylindroiulus caeruleocinctus (Wood), C. truncorum (Silvestri), Ophyiulus pilosus (Newport) (all Julida: Julidae), and Opiona fisheri Gardner and Shelley (Chordeumatida: Caseyidae) are newly recorded from California. The new combination Atopetholus wheeleri (Chamberlin) is proposed.
23375579|Field collections at more than 2900 sites and the examination of many museum collections and literature allowed me to map the historical and current distribution of several freshwater molluscan faunal groups in the Intermountain region of the United States (Great Basin, Colorado River drainage basin, and upper Snake River sub-basin). Historical and current records show that Margaritifera falcata, Anodonta californiensis, and Ferrissia rivularis have drainage-specific distributions, while Valvata utahensis has a specific drainage pattern, and V. californica (new combination) has a dispersed pattern. Shell morphometric data of Valvata and Ferrissia show extensive shell variation between and within populations. Current surveys show that these molluscan populations have been reduced since the colonization by European descendants over the last 150 years. Margaritifera falcata was found to be extirpated from eastern California, Nevada, and Utah and was common in only 1 stream. Anodonta californiensis populations of 10 or more individuals occurred in only 2 of 13 drainages, as well as in 1 isolated spring. Valvata californica was extirpated in 7 of 10 lakes. Ferrissia rivularis was very rare in 6 of 12 drainages. Range declines among these fauna are thought to be related to alterations of habitat caused by grazing, irrigation, and urbanization, as well as the intensive management of sport fish in these waters.
23375563|This study summarizes cytogenetic variation, particularly sex-linked chromosomal inversions which define taxa of the Simulium arcticum complex (Diptera: Simuliidae) in western Montana and portions of northern Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Variation in polytene chromosomes was determined for nearly 15,000 larvae from 234 collections taken from 58 freshwater sites. The previously described siblings, S. apricarium, S. arcticum sensu stricto, S. brevicercum, and S. saxosum, were most numerous, while all cytotypes, with the exception of IIL-19, were found in low frequency. Additionaly, 6 new cytotypes in low frequency are described. Evidence suggests that the Y chromosome carries the testis-determining gene, and in almost all taxa of S. arcticum, complex paracentric inversions characterize these types. Distributions of (1) S. brevicercum and S. arcticum s. s., (2) S. arcticum s. s. and S. arcticum IIL-18, (3) S. brevicercum and S. arcticum IIL-18, and (4) S. arcticum IIL-9 and S. arcticum IIL-19 have highly significant positive geographic associations, while those of (1) S. apricarium and S. brevicercum and (2) S. apricarium and S. saxosum have highly significant negative geographic associations. The S. arcticum cytotypes IIS-12, IIL-17, IIL-21, IIL-22, IIL-38, IIL-51, IIL-68, IIL-7374, and IIL-79 occur only at 2 or fewer locations. Polyploids (0.0007), pericentric inversions (0.00007) and chromosomal translocations (0.00007) are exceedingly rare. These observations and our recent DNA comparisons of chromosomally distinct types lead me to elaborate on a previously suggested model for chromosome evolution in black flies. In this model, locally distributed cytotypes may become more common with time, while widespread cytospecies may eventually become morphologically differentiated types. Contrary to the current understanding that chromosome variation may not play a significant role in the speciation process of most animals, this study suggests that chromosomal variation, at least in black flies, plays a significant role in speciation. Este estudio resume la variacin citogentica, en particular las inversiones de los cromosomas sexuales que definen a los taxa del complejo Simulium arcticum (Diptera: Simuliidae) en el oeste de Montana y partes del norte de Idaho, en el estado de Washington y en Oregon. Se determin la variacin en los cromosomas politnicos de aproximadamente 15,000 larvas a partir de 234 muestras que se tomaron en 58 sitios de agua dulce. Las especies hermanas descritas previamente: S. apricarium, S. arcticum sensu stricto, S. brevicercum, y S. saxosum, fueron las ms numerosas, mientras que todos los citotipos con la excepcin de IIL-19 se encontraron en frecuencia baja. Adems, se describen seis nuevos citotipos de frecuencia baja. La evidencia sugiere que el cromosoma Y conlleva el gen determinante de los testculos y en casi todos los taxa de S. arcticum las inversiones paracntricas caracterizan a estos tipos. Las distribuciones de (1) S. brevicercum y S arcticum s. s., de (2) S. arcticum s. s. y S. arcticum IIL-18, de (3) S. brevicercum y S. arcticum IIL-18, y de (4) S. arcticum IIL-9 y S. arcticum IIL-19 tienen asociaciones geogrficas positivas altamente significativas, mientras que las distribuciones de (1) S. apricarium y S. brevicercum y de (2) S. apricarium y S. saxosum tienen asociaciones geogrficas negativas altamente significativas. Los citotipos de S. arcticum: IIS-12, IIL-17, IIL-21, IIL-22, IIL-38, IIL-51, IIL-68, IIL-7374 e IIL-79 se encuentran en dos o menos localidades. Los poliploides (0.0007), las inversiones pericntricas (0.00007) y las translocaciones cromosmicas (0.00007) son extremamente raros. Estas observaciones y nuestras comparaciones recientes de ADN de tipos cromosmicamente diferentes, me llevaron a trabajar sobre un modelo sugerido previamente para la evolucin de cromosomas en moscas negras en las cuales los citotipos distribuidos localmente pueden volverse ms comunes con el tiempo, mientras que las citoespecies de amplia distribucin pueden convertirse eventualmente en tipos morfolgicamente distintos. Al contrario de la nocin actual de la variacin en los cromosomas puede no desempear un papel fundamental en el proceso de especiacin de la mayora de los animales, este estudio sugiere que la variacin cromosmica, al menos en las moscas negras, desempea un papel fundamental en la especiacin.
23375553|This is the first treatment of the mammals of the Grand StaircaseEscalante National Monument (GSENM). GSENM was established in 1996 as a 1.7-million-acre (680,000-ha) federal land reserve under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). To successfully manage this new monument, the BLM is presently developing a management action plan. To provide information for the proper management of mammal species of the area, we have reviewed background literature for each mammal potentially found within the Monument boundaries. We propose that a core area, surrounded by a buffer matrix, be used in GSENM and surrounding public lands to preserve ecological processes in their natural state. One hundred thirteen mammalian species are categorized as follows: 82 contemporary species, 21 species questionably present, 4 introduced species reportedly in the Monument, and 6 historical species. Altogether, potentially 107 mammalian species exist there currently. Of 82 contemporary species, 11 are listed in the Utah State Sensitive Species List, 1 in the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), and 1 in the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red Book. Mammals listed under the 1973 Endangered Species Act (ESA) are noted when applicable, as well as State of Utah listings as endangered, threatened, sensitive, or extirpated. For each mammalian species listed, we present in telegraphic style a life history account, sensitivity status, and currently accepted nomenclature.
23375592|Examination of published records, and morphometric and morphologic analyses of 3398 museum specimens, revealed that 4 genera including 30 monotypic and 5 polytypic species of shrews (Soricidae) occur in Mexico. Of these, 2 new species were named and 2 subspecies were heretofore unrecognized, 3 were reclassified, and 1 was elevated to species level. Cryptotis goldmani machetes, previously subsumed into C. g. goldmani, was reelevated based on ventral pelage color. Sorex veraepacis mutabilis contained 2 morphotypes, 1 of which matched that of the holotype; however, the 2nd morphotype not only did not match that of the subspecific holotype, but also has a sympatric distribution. Thus, specimens of the 2nd morphotype are referred to a new species: Sorex ixtlanensis. Sorex saussurei formerly contained 4 subspecies of which the nominal S. s. saussurei contained 3 morphotypes based on position of the median tines of the I1s. Specimens of 1 morphotype match the holotype, have a distribution limited to the Transvolcanic Belt, and are referred to the now monotypic S. saussurei. Specimens of the 2nd morphotype, herein referred to a new species Sorex mediopua, also are limited to the Transvolcanic Belt and can be found at many of the same localities as those of S. saussurei. Specimens of the 3rd morphotype, not only include a portion of the specimens formerly included in S. s. saussurei, but all those previously referred to the other 3 subspecies of S. saussurei: cristobalensis, oaxacae, and veraecrucis. Based on priority, veraecrucis is elevated to specific status with cristobalensis and oaxacae as subspecies. The specimens formerly contained within S. s. saussurei are referred to a new subspecies: Sorex veraecrucis altoensis. Sorex veraecrucis now has the broadest distribution of any taxon of shrews in Mexico. El examen de los registros publicados y los anlisis de morfomtricos y morfolgicos de 3398 especimenes de museo, revelaron que cuatro gneros, incluyendo 30 especies monotpicas y cinco politpicas de musaraas (Soricidae), ocurren en Mxico. De stas, dos especies nuevas fueron nombradas y dos subespecies dejaron de ser reconocidas a partir de ahora, tres fueron reclasificadas y una fue elevada al nivel de especie. Cryptotis goldmani, previamente considerada la subespecie nominal, fue restablecida con base en el color del pelage ventral. En Sorex veraepacis mutabilis se encontraron dos morfotipos, uno de los cuales corresponda con el holotipo subespecfico, mientras que el otro adems de ser diferente, mostraba distribucin simptrica. Por ende, los especimenes este morfotipo son referidos a la nueva especie, Sorex ixtlanensis. Originalmente, Sorex saussurei estaba representada por cuatro subespecies de las cuales la nominal, S. s. saussurei, inclua tres morfotipos, con base en la posicin de las cspides accesorias mediales de los I1. Los especimenes de uno de los morfotipos corresponden con el holotipo, tienen una distribucin limitada al Eje Volcnico Transversal y son referidas a S. saussurei, ahora considerada monotpica. Los especimenes del segundo morfotipo, considerados aqu dentro de la nueva especie Sorex mediopua, tambin se limitan al Eje Volcnico Transversal y pueden ser encontrados en varias de las mismas localidades de los ejemplares de S. saussurei. Los especimenes del tercer morfotipo no solo incluyen una porcin de los ejemplares inicialmente incluidos en S. s. saussurei, sino a todos los que previamente eran referidos a las otras tres subespecies de S. saussurei: cristobalensis, oaxacae y veraecrucis. Por prioridad, veraecrucis es elevada al nivel especfico, quedando cristobalensis y oaxacae como subespecies. Los especimenes inicialmente asignados dentro de S. s. saussurei son referidos a la nueva subespecie, Sorex veraecrucis altoensis. S. veraecrucis tiene ahora la distribucin ms extensa entre todos los taxa de musaraas en Mxico.
23375561|During the last few decades, detailed studies of bats have been conducted in many parts of Nebraska, but comprehensive surveys were lacking in the Wildcat Hills and other western regions of the state. The Wildcat Hills represent a unique and isolated area of rugged buttes, ridges, and canyons dominated by ponderosa pine forests (Pinus ponderosa) in central parts of Nebraska's panhandle. This area also contains landscapes with some of the highest wind speeds in the state, making it conducive for future wind-energy development. To better understand the natural history of bats and to promote conservation efforts in the region, we report on the distribution of bats and their habitats, as well as on their relative abundance, seasonal activity, and reproduction in the Wildcat Hills and surrounding areas. From August 1997 to July 2011, we captured 968 bats representing 7 species, and we also examined museum specimens previously collected by other researchers from the region. For 5 species, we extend the known period of nonhibernating activity in the state, and we provide evidence of reproducing populations for 7 species in the region based on presence of lactating females. New reproductive information for bats in Nebraska also includes timing of pregnancy and lactation, as well as presence of volant young. For migratory species during autumn migration, hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) began moving through the region earlier (late July/early August) than silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Documentation of the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) in riparian areas and buildings along the North Platte River represents a range extension for this species from the Pine Ridge in northwestern Nebraska. Knowledge gained from our long-term study will assist resource managers and biologists in efforts to protect and manage bats as these bats face unprecedented challenges in the future with development of additional wind-energy facilities and likely westward spread of white-nose syndrome in North America. Durante las ltimas dcadas, se han llevado a cabo estudios detallados sobre murcilagos en varias partes de Nebraska, pero faltaban estudios integrales en las colinas Wildcat Hills y en otras regiones del oeste del estado. Las colinas Wildcat Hills representan un rea nica y aislada de colinas escarpadas, cerros y caones dominados por bosques de pinos ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) en la parte central de la franja oeste de Nebraska. Esta rea tambin posee paisajes con algunas de las velocidades de viento ms altas del estado, lo que contribuye al futuro desarrollo de la energa elica. Para comprender mejor la historia natural de los murcilagos y para promover los esfuerzos de conservacin en la regin, informamos sobre la distribucin de los murcilagos y sus hbitats, la abundancia relativa, la actividad estacional y la reproduccin en las colinas Wildcat Hills y en las reas circundantes. Desde agosto de 1997 a julio de 2011, capturamos 968 murcilagos que representan 7 especies y tambin examinamos especmenes de museo previamente recogidos por otros investigadores de la regin. Para 5 especies, extendemos el perodo conocido de actividad (no hibernacin) en el estado y proporcionamos evidencia de poblaciones de 7 especies en reproduccin en la regin con base en la presencia de hembras lactantes. Nueva informacin sobre la reproduccin de murcilagos en Nebraska tambin incluye el tiempo de preez y lactancia, as como tambin la presencia de cras voladoras. Con respecto a especies migratorias, los murcilagos blancos (Lasiurus cinereus) y los murcilagos colorados del este (Lasiurus borealis) comenzaron a trasladarse por la regin antes (a fines de julio y comienzos de agosto) que los murcilagos plateados (Lasionycteris noctivagans) durante la migracin de otoo. La documentacin del murcilago marrn pequeo (Myotis lucifugus) en reas ribereas y edificaciones a lo largo del Ro North Platte representa una extensin del rango de distribucin de esta especie desde Pine Ridge en el noroeste de Nebraska. El conocimiento adquirido a partir de nuestro estudio de largo plazo asistir a los manejadores de recursos y bilogos en sus esfuerzos por proteger y controlar a los murcilagos mientras enfrentan desafos sin precedentes en el futuro, con el desarrollo de nuevas instalaciones de energa elica y la posible propagacin del sndrome de nariz blanca en Norteamrica.
23375585|Information is presented dealing with the western North American species of the subfamily Donaciinae, with emphasis on data from the state of Utah. Dichotomous keys and short diagnoses are provided to enable identification of genera and species. Previously published records from Utah are summarized. For each species, the overall North American distribution is summarized, and detailed records are given for Utah. Reported host plants for each species are also listed.
23375568|We determined the bat fauna at Mesa Verde National Park (Mesa Verde) in 2006 and 2007, characterized bat elevational distribution and reproduction, and investigated roosting habits of selected species. We captured 1996 bats of 15 species in mist nets set over water during 120 nights of sampling and recorded echolocation calls of an additional species. The bat fauna at Mesa Verde included every species of bat known west of the Great Plains in Colorado, except the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus). Some species showed skewed sex ratios, primarily due to a preponderance of males. Thirteen species of bats reproduced at Mesa Verde. Major differences in spring precipitation between the 2 years of our study were associated with differences in reproductive rates and, in some species, with numbers of juveniles captured. Reduced reproductive effort during spring drought will have a greater impact on bat populations with the forecasted increase in aridity in much of western North America by models of global climate change. We radiotracked 46 bats of 5 species to roosts and describe the first-known maternity colonies of spotted bats (Euderma maculatum) in Colorado. All 5 species that we tracked to diurnal roosts relied almost exclusively on rock crevices rather than trees or snags, despite the presence of mature forests at Mesa Verde and the use of trees for roosts in similar forests elsewhere by some of these species. Comparisons with past bat surveys at Mesa Verde and in surrounding areas suggest no dramatic evidence for effects of recent stand-replacing fires on the composition of the bat community.
23375578|This article reviews the capniid genus Paracapnia Hanson and describes a new species, P. boris, from males and females collected in northern California, provisionally assigned to the genus. Paracapnia oswegaptera (Jewett) is placed in synonymy with P. ensicala (Jewett), and the first description is provided for the male of P. disala (Jewett). Keys are presented for recognized Palearctic and Nearctic members of the genus. Distribution data are given for specimens examined and for those in the published literature.
23375562|Documentation of the biodiversity of eukaryotic algae from desert systems is sparse. Our objective was to characterize microalgae from soil samples collected throughout Joshua Tree National Park, California, USA. Morphological, life-cycle, and DNA sequence data were collected for 100 microalgal isolates distributed over 18 sites in Joshua Tree National Park. Phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rDNA data separated the green algae into 15 major clades10 in the class Chlorophyceae and 5 in the class Trebouxiophyceaecontaining 2 or more lineages plus 9 lineages represented by a single isolate. Five isolates belonging to the class Xanthophyceae and 2 isolates belonging to Eustigmatophyceae were also identified. Some green algal isolates could be placed with confidence in known genera including Bracteacoccus, Chlorosarcinopsis, Myrmecia, Neochlorosarcina, Scenedesmus, and Stichococcus, whereas several green isolates could not be assigned to known genera based on morphological or molecular data. Both morphological and molecular data were important to identifying this biodiversity. Due to the paucity of informative morphological characters, morphology alone does not capture the species diversity found at sites. Molecular data are a richer source of characters with which to identify the algae, but more representative sequences of soil algae are needed in public databases to make identification of any new taxa straightforward. Overall, our data suggest that the biodiversity of these hot deserts still is largely unknown and unexplored. La documentacin sobre la biodiversidad de las algas eucariotas de los sistemas de desierto es escasa. Nuestro objetivo fue caracterizar las microalgas de muestras de suelo colectadas a lo largo del Parque Nacional Joshua Tree en California (Estados Unidos). Se recopilaron datos sobre la morfologa, el ciclo de vida y las secuencias de ADN de 100 microalgas aisladas de 18 puntos del Parque Nacional Joshua Tree. El anlisis filogentico del gen rADN 18S separ a las algas verdes en 15 clados principales10 en la clase Chlorophyceae y cinco en la clase Trebouxiophyceaeque contienen dos o ms linajes ms nueve linajes representados por un solo aislado. Tambin se identificaron cinco aislados que pertenecen a la clase Xanthophyceae y dos aislados que pertenecen a la clase Eustigmatophyceae. Algunos aislados de algas verdes pudieron ubicarse con certeza en gneros conocidos, incluyendo a Bracteacoccus, Chlorosarcinopsis, Myrmecia, Neochlorosarcina, Scenedesmus y Stichococcus, mientras que varios aislados de algas verdes no pudieron asignarse a gneros conocidos con base en su informacin morfolgica o molecular. Tanto la informacin morfolgica como la molecular fueron importantes para identificar esta biodiversidad. La morfologa por s sola no captura la diversidad de las especies que se encontr en los sitios debido a la escasez de caractersticas morfolgicas informativas. Los datos moleculares son una fuente ms abundante de rasgos con las cuales se pueden identificar a las algas, pero se necesitan secuencias ms representativas de algas terrestres en bases de datos pblicas para identificar de manera inequvoca cualquier nuevo taxn. En general, nuestros datos sugieren que la biodiversidad de estos desiertos de elevadas temperaturas an permanece mayormente desconocida e inexplorada.
23375570|The Fort Irwin National Training Center in the Mojave Desert of California contains soils that represent a diversity of disturbance regimes, including some soil sites that have been protected from anthropogenic disturbance for many years. Previous studies of the soils of this military installation discussed biogeography and ecology of the crusts but did not conduct detailed study of the species present. In this study, we selected 6 sites in and around the Fort Irwin Training Center to be the subject of intensive isolation efforts. These sites contained at least some development of microbiotic soil crust. Out of the more than 90 cyanobacterial isolates characterized, only 23 distinctive morphospecies were differentiated. Of these, only 13 were identified to a previously described species, the others being comparable to previously described aquatic species (cf.) or so dissimilar to described taxa that they were given numbers as identification. Leptolyngbya was the most species rich and also the most commonly isolated genus. Twelve filamentous genera were found; no coccoid representatives occurred in our samples. All taxa are described and illustrated. This study is significant as it is the first since the 1960s to examine cyanobacterial taxonomy of Mojave Desert soils in a systematic fashion. Our unidentified taxa are very likely new species but will require molecular sequence analysis before they can be named.
23375576|This paper reviews the status of 39 Anacroneuria species reported for Mexico, the adjacent areas of Mesoamerica (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua), and the United States. Sixteen species are described as new (A. baumanni, A. brailovskyi, A. buenoi, A. contrerasi, A. izapa, A. mixteca, A. olmec, A. pareja, A. quetzalcoatl, A. ratcliffei, A. senahu, A. shepardi, A. sonora, A. wellsi, A. zaculeu, and A. zaga). Anacroneuria sulana Needham and Broughton is removed from synonymy with A. annulicauda (Pictet) and classified as a synonym of A. lineata (Navas). Anacroneuria proxima Klaplek, A. crenulata Jewett, and A. comanche Stark and Baumann are classified as synonyms of A. litura (Pictet). Identification keys are presented for males in the region, and the nymphs of 2 species, A. baumanni and A. quadriloba, are described.
23375587|Great Basin National Park in east central Nevada encompasses most of the southern Snake Range including Wheeler Peak, which at 3980 m is the highest peak in the interior Great Basin. The original detailed surveys of the mammals of this region were made between 1929 and 1939 by field crews from the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley. Between 2000 and 2003, we conducted additional field surveys of mammals in the park region in conjunction with the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring Program. Here, we provide a comprehensive report on the mammal fauna of the park and its immediate surroundings based on a review of historical records and recent field surveys. We document 48 native species of mammals in the region. In addition, there are 7 species that potentially occur within the park, 4 species of questionable occurrence, 6 species formerly present but now extirpated, and 4 nonnative species. We provide a short account for each species that summarizes ecology and local distribution and lists both historical and recent records of occurrence. Through comparative analysis of historical and recent data, we examine faunal changes in the park region during the past 70 years. Based on our results, we make some general recommendations for future resource management.
23375569|The birds of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, in southern Utah and northern Arizona, are documented, with information on abundance, distribution, ecology, residency status, and breeding status. In all, 316 species have been reported from the park since the first surveys in the region during the 1930s. Historical survey data from the pre-Glen Canyon Dam surveys are incorporated, as well as significant work done in the park since 1992. Breeding is documented for 87 species, including 82 native species and 5 exotic species. Many rare species are reported for the first time from this section of the state, and several recent range extensions are documented.
23375554|Southern Utah comprises 4 major physiographic divisions: the Great Basin, Colorado Plateau, Central Rocky Mountains, and Southern Rocky Mountains, which have been partitioned into faunal regions. We discuss the uniqueness of southern Utah and the amount of land set aside for recreation and preservation, and we encourage the study and preservation of its water resources. The stonefly (Plecoptera) fauna of 13 counties in southern Utah was surveyed. We found 58 species representing 34 genera and 8 families. Three new state records for Utah and many new county records for southern Utah are presented, along with a discussion of distribution patterns and faunal affinities of each species. Distribution patterns indicate a historical connection between the Sevier River and the Colorado drainage and a separation of faunal areas within the Central Rocky Mountains at boundaries between the Wasatch Mountains, Wasatch Plateau, and the Southern High Plateau. The uniqueness of the isolated Abajo and LaSal Mountains, the Virgin River valley, and other faunal areas in southern Utah is presented.
23375564|Herein we clarify the taxonomy of Fluminicola coloradensis Morrison (1940), which was described for populations in the Green River and Bonneville basins but has also been treated as restricted to the former watershed and conspecific with (currently unassigned) Snake River basin populations of Fluminicola hindsi sensu Taylor (1966). Bayesian analyses of DNA sequences from 2 mitochondrial genes congruently resolved F. coloradensis and Snake River basin populations of F. hindsi sensu Taylor as a strongly supported, shallowly structured clade. Haplotypes were extensively shared by Bonneville, Snake River and Green River populations; AMOVA did not detect significant variation among basins for either gene. Morphological variation was minor. Based on these results, we assign the Snake River basin populations to F. coloradensis. We attribute the limited differentiation of widely ranging F. coloradensis to its well-integrated habitats and to dispersal mediated by geologically recent drainage transfers. The broadly disjunct population in the Owyhee River drainage may be a product of translocation, as evidenced by detection of only the most common haplotypes in these snails. Our finding that F. coloradensis is more widely distributed than previously thought suggests that it may not require conservation attention rangewide, although some geographic subunits may be at risk. En este resumen clarificamos la taxonoma de Fluminicola coloradensis Morrison (1940), que se describi en el caso de las poblaciones de las cuencas del Green River y Bonneville, pero tambin se consider restringida a la anterior lnea divisoria y especie congnere (actualmente sin clasificar) de las poblaciones de Fluminicola hindsi sensu Taylor (1966) de la cuenca del Snake River. Los anlisis bayesianos de las secuencias de ADN de dos genes mitocondriales coincidieron en que las poblaciones de F. coloradensis y de Fluminicola hindsi sensu Taylor de la cuenca de Snake River constituyen un clado de estructura superficial y slida. Los haplotipos se encontraban en gran parte de las poblaciones de Bonneville, Snake River y Green River; el anlisis de varianza molecular (AMOVA) no detect variaciones significativas entre las cuencas en el caso de ningn gen y la variacin morfolgica no fue significativa. Segn estos resultados asignamos las poblaciones de la cuenca de Snake River a F. coloradensis. Atribuimos la poca diferenciacin de de la variada F. coloradensis, a sus hbitats bien integrados y a la intervencin de los flujos de desages recientes desde el punto de vista geolgico en la accin del agente dispersor. La existencia de una poblacin dispersa en el desage de Owyhee River puede ser consecuencia de la traslocacin, como lo demuestra el hecho de que se hayan detectado nicamente los haplotipos ms comunes en estos caracoles. Nuestro hallazgo de que F. coloradensis se encuentra en ms reas biogeogrficas de lo que suponamos sugiere que, aunque haya algunas subunidades que se encuentran en peligro, tal vez no sea necesario tomar medidas de conservacin en toda el rea.
23375560|Although lichens are a common feature in Wyoming, there has been no attempt to compile a statewide list of species since 1900. A number of surveys have been conducted in the state, especially in Yellowstone National Park and other federally managed parks and forests, though little attention has been given to lower-elevation regions of the state. The literature search conducted for this project yielded nearly 800 species names, which number was reduced to 608 currently accepted taxa. Collection locations and references are provided for each taxon, as are global ranks (conservation status, from NatureServe.org), and a brief discussion of some of the interesting results. Aunque los lquenes son tpicos en Wyoming, no ha habido intentos de compilar una lista de especies a nivel estatal desde 1900. Se han llevado a cabo una cantidad de estudios en el estado, especialmente en el Parque Nacional Yellowstone y en otros parques y bosques administrados por el estado, aunque se ha prestado poca atencin a las regiones de menor elevacin del estado. La investigacin bibliogrfica llevada a cabo para este proyecto result en aproximadamente 800 nombres de especies, que se redujeron a 608 taxa actualmente aceptados. Se proporcionan las localidades de colecta y referencias para cada taxn, as como tambin se proporcionan las categoras globales (estado de conservacin de NatureServe.org) y una breve discusin sobre algunos de los resultados interesantes.
