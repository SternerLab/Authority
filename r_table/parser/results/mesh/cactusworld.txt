42794813|The Fortaleza river valley was explored as far as Chaquistambo, which is at the border with the Department Ancash. Over the next two days, after staying in Barranca, we entered the Congas gorge to reach Choque at 1600m altitude and the Ocros gorge road, and thence to Lacchas at 2500m. On the fourth day we arrived at the entrance to the Aco gorge at 1200m, and then took the Copa gorge road at 1860m, and thence to Cajatambo at 3376m. Retracing our route from Cajatambo, we took the Llipa road at 1450m and travelled a further 8km to the Gorgor gorge road at 1700m, before returning to Barranca. Next morning we tried to find Haageocereus lanugispinus on the lomas behind the city of Barranca, unfortunately without success, and returned to Lima that afternoon. The cacti seen at these locations were: Armatocereus matucanensis, Armatocereus proceras, Austrocylindropuntia pachypus, Austrocylindropuntia subulata ssp. exaltata, Cleistocactus fieldianus ssp. tessellatus, Echinopsis peruviana, Espostoa melanostele, Haageocereus acranthus ssp. zonatus, Haageocereus pseudomelanostele ssp. acanthocladus, Haagespostoa villigera, Matucana haynei, Melocactus peruvianus, Neoraimondia arequipensis ssp. roseiflora and Opuntia pubescens, all of them already mentioned in the Huaura river valley articles by Ostolaza et al. (2003, 2005). We also found two species in the Fortaleza river valley described here: Cleistocactus sulcifer and Corryocactus tenuiculus, plus other species described elsewhere: Cleistocactus acanthurus ssp. pullatus, Cylindropuntia tunicata, Mila caespitosa and Haageocereus vulpes. We also saw other succulents such as: Deuterocohnia longipetala, Tillandsia latifolia (Figs. 24 & 27) and T. paleacea (Bromeliaceae); Cnidoscolus basiacanthus (Fig. 25) and Jatropha macrantha (Euphorbiaceae), and Furcraea occidentalis (Agavaceae).
