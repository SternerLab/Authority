PBZ10122|Birds have demonstrated a remarkable ability to manipulate offspring sex. Previous studies suggest that treatment with hormones can stimulate females to manipulate offspring sex before ovulation. For example, chronic treatments with corticosterone, the primary stress hormone produced by birds, stimulated significant skews toward female offspring. It has been suggested that corticosterone acts by influencing which sex chromosome is donated by the heterogametic female bird into the ovulated ovarian follicle. However, it is difficult to pinpoint when in developmental time corticosterone affects offspring sex, because in previous studies corticosterone treatment was given over a long period of time. We treated laying hens with acute high-dose corticosterone injections 5 h before the predicted time of ovulation and quantified the sexes of the subsequently ovulated eggs to determine whether mechanisms exist by which corticosterone can skew offspring sex ratios just before ovulation. We hypothesized that an injection of corticosterone coincident with segregation of the sex chromosomes would stimulate hens to produce more female than male offspring. Contrary to our predictions, hens injected with corticosterone produced a significant bias toward male offspring, nearly 83%. These results suggest that acute corticosterone treatment during meiosis I can influence primary sex ratios in birds, potentially through nonrandom chromosome segregation. Furthermore, acute corticosterone exposure, compared with chronic exposure, may act through different mechanisms to skew offspring sex.
30161080|Recent reports on patterns and occurrence of torpor and other natural hypothermic states in birds have prompted a revision of many longstanding opinions. For instance, a larger assortment of birds covering a wider range of body mass than previously recognized uses energyconserving mechanisms in the face of abundant food supplies. Thus, although acute energetic stress triggers the occurrence of hypometabolic states in many birds, energy deficits can no longer be regarded as the sole stimulus for avian torpor. Additionally, the phenology of this phenomenon (phases, duration, depth) shows more interspecific variation than previously appreciated, and traditional concepts of the phases of torpor are not always adequate. Hence, inclusive definitions of torpor based on physiological and/or behavioral criteria have become more difficult to formulate.

30097044|Because selection on juvenile lifehistory stages is likely strong, disproportionately high levels of performance (e.g., sprint speed, endurance, etc.) might be expected. Whereas this phenomenon has been demonstrated with respect to locomotor performance, data for feeding are scarce. Here, we investigate the relationships among body dimensions, head dimensions, and bite force during growth in lizards and turtles. We also investigate whether ontogenetic changes in bite performance are related to changes in diet. Our analyses show that, for turtles, head dimensions generally increase with negative allometry. For lizards, heads scale as expected for geometrically growing systems. Bite force generally increased isometrically with carapace length in turtles but showed significant positive allometry relative to body dimensions in lizards. However, both lizards and turtles display positive allometric scaling of bite force relative to some measures of head size throughout ontogeny, suggesting (1) strong selection for increased relative bite performance with increasing head size and (2) intrinsic changes in the geometry and/or mass of the jaw adductors during growth. Whereas our data generally do not provide strong evidence of compensation for lower absolute levels of performance, they do show strong links among morphology, bite force, and diet during growth.

30160036|Do animal species that normally consume large meals at long intervals evolve to downregulate their metabolic physiology while fasting and to upregulate it steeply on feeding? To test this hypothesis, we compared postfeeding regulatory responses in eight snake species: four frequent feeders on small meals and four infrequent feeders on large meals. For each species, we measured factorial changes in metabolic rate, in activities and capacities of five small intestinal brush border nutrient transporters, and in masses of eight organs that function in nutrient processing after consumption of a rodent meal equivalent to 25% of the snake's body mass. It turned out that, compared with frequent feeders, infrequent feeders digest that meal more slowly; have lower metabolic rates, organ masses, and nutrient uptake rates and capacities while fasting; have higher energy expenditure during digestion; and have higher postfeeding factorial increases in metabolic rate, organ masses, and nutrient uptake rates and capacities. These conclusions, which conform to the hypothesis mentioned above, remain after phylogeny has been taken into account. The small organ masses and low nutrient transporter activities during fasting contribute to the low fasting metabolism of infrequent feeders. Quantitative calculations of partial energy budgets suggest that energy savings drive the evolution of low mass and activities of organs during fasting and of large postfeeding regulatory responses in infrequent feeders. We propose further tests of this hypothesis among other snake species and among other ectotherms.

10.1086/651564|The allometric 3/4 power relation, initially used for describing the relation between mammalian basal metabolic rate and body size, is often used as a general model for organismal design. The use of allometric regression as a model has important limitations: it is not mechanistic, it combines all physiological variables into one correlate of body size, and it combines data from several physiological states. In reassessing the use of allometric equations, we first describe problems with their use in studies of organismal design and then use a formulation for distributed net heat production and temperature distribution within the body to derive an alternative equation for the relation between basal metabolism and body size. Tests of the heat flow equation against data reported in the literature indicate that it is an accurate estimator of basal metabolism under thermoneutral conditions and suggest that the allometric equation is a special case of this mechanistic and more general model. We propose that our method is more meaningful and widely applicable for thermoneutral conditions than is a purely allometric approach.
10.1086/651584|Survival success under conditions of acute oxygen deprivation depends on efficiency of the central and peripheral chemoreception, optimization of oxygen extraction from the hypoxic environment and its delivery to the periphery, and adjustments of energy production and consumption. This article uses a comparative approach to assess the efficiency of adaptive strategies used by anoxiatolerant and hypoxiasensitive species to support survival during the first minutes to 1 h of oxygen deprivation. An aquatic environment is much more demanding in terms of diurnal and seasonal variations of the ambient oxygen availability from anoxia to hyperoxia than is an air environment. Therefore, fishes and aquatic turtles have developed a number of adaptive responses, which are lacking in most of the terrestrial mammals, to cope with these extreme conditions. These include efficient central and peripheral chemoreception, acute changes in respiratory rate and amplitude, and acute increase of the gasexchange interface. A special set of adaptive mechanisms are engaged in reduction of the energy expenditure of the major oxygenconsuming organs: the brain and the heart. Both reduction of ATP consumption and a switch to alterative energy sources contribute to the maintenance of ATP and ion balance in hypoxiatolerant animals. Hypoxia and hyperoxia are conditions favoring development of oxidative stress. Efficient protection from oxidation in anoxiatolerant species includes reduction in the glutamate levels in the brain, stabilization of the mitochondrial function, and maintenance of nitric oxide production under conditions of oxygen deprivation. We give an overview of the current state of knowledge on some selected molecular and cellular acute adaptive mechanisms. These include the mechanisms of chemoreception in adult and neonatal mammals and in fishes, acute metabolic adaptive responses in the brain, and the role of nitrite in the preservation of heart function under hypoxic conditions.

The question about how captivity per se affects studied parameters is therefore of central importance for generalizing the information gained from such studies. We addressed this question by comparing various indexes of physiological condition of wintering greenfinches sampled in the wild and kept in captivity for different time periods. Bringing wild greenfinches into captivity did not result in systematic alteration in nine of 12 physiological parameters studied. Captive birds had consistently lower plasma carotenoid and uric acid levels than wild ones. Variation in differential leukocyte counts did not reveal any signs of elevated stress of birds kept in captivity. These results indicate that for a number of physiological parameters, information obtained from captive animals can be generalized to natural situations. Variance in traits most closely related to physical exercise capacity (body mass and hematocrit) were much lower in the wild than in captivity. These findings suggest that under harsh environmental conditions experienced by wild birds (i.e., predation threat, scarce resources), traits such as hematocrit and body mass are fine tuned by physiological tradeoffs.

The objectives were to assess the abilities of these two species with dramatically different torpor patterns (1) to conserve skeletal muscle morphology, protein, and strength and (2) to use labile protein in the small intestine and liver during the winter season of reduced activity and food intake. Mass and protein concentration of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus, liver, and small intestine, as well as skeletal muscle strength and fiber morphology for the EDL and soleus, were compared before and after hibernation in both species. Both species appeared to be similar to overwintering black bears and underwent very little strength and protein loss, as compared with euthermic models of immobility and longterm fasting. Although the two species used vastly different hibernation strategies, none of the changes in parameters related to muscle atrophy and labileprotein use during the hibernation season differed significantly between them. Therefore, it appears that regardless of the phenotypic expressions of hibernation, the outcome is the conservation of skeletal muscle.

This dearth of knowledge may be due to the time-consuming nature of analyzing film, which imposes a practical limit on sample sizes.

Additionally, the ongoing differentiation and growth of tissues and the development of sensorymotor integration during early ontogeny may constrain performance. Because ectothermic vertebrates show different growth regimes and energetic requirements when compared to endothermic vertebrates, differences in the ontogenetic trajectories of performance traits in these two groups might be expected. However, both groups of vertebrates show similar patterns of changes in performance with ontogeny. Evidence for compensation, resulting in relatively high levels of performance in juveniles relative to adults, appears common for traits related to locomotor and defensive behaviors. However, there is little evidence for compensation in traits associated with feeding and foraging. We suggest that this difference may be due to different selective regimes operating on locomotor versus feeding traits. As a result, relatively high levels of locomotor performance in juveniles and relatively high levels of feeding performance in adults are observed across a wide range of vertebrate groups.

One of its main tenets, the allocation principle, predicts that selection will reduce energy costs of maintenance in order to divert energy to survival and reproduction. The empirical support for this principle is the existence of a negative relationship between fitness and metabolic rate, which has been observed in some ectotherms. In juvenile animals, a key function affecting fitness is growth rate, since fast growers will reproduce sooner and maximize survival. In principle, design constraints dictate that growth rate cannot be reduced without affecting maintenance costs. Hence, it is predicted that juveniles will show a positive relationship between fitness (growth rate) and metabolic rate, contrarily to what has been observed in adults. Here we explored this problem using land snails (

Both sea lion groups consumed highquality fish (herring) before and after the energy restrictions. During restrictions, group H was fed a lower quantity of herring and group P a caloric equivalent of lowquality fish (pollock). Quantitative estimates of maintenance and production energies and qualitative estimates of thermoregulation, activity, and basal metabolic rate were measured. During summer, all animals compensated for the imposed energy deficit by releasing stored energy (production energy). Group H also optimized the energy allocation to seasonal conditions by increasing activity during summer, when fish are naturally abundant (foraging effort), and by decreasing thermoregulation capacity when waters are warmer. During winter, both groups decreased the energy allocated to overall maintenance functions (basal metabolic rate, thermoregulation, and activity together) in addition to releasing stored energy, but they preserved thermoregulatory capacity. Group H also decreased activity levels in winter, when foraging in the wild is less efficient, unlike group P. Overall, sea lions fed pollock did not change energy allocation to suit environmental conditions as readily as those fed herring. This implies that a low energydensity diet may further reduce fitness of animals in the wild during periods of nutritional stress.

The defining characteristic of cetaceans is a thick and dense lip (pachyosteosclerotic involucrum) of an ear bone (the tympanic). This unique feature is absent in modern terrestrial artiodactyls and is suggested to be important in underwater hearing. Here, we investigate the mineralogical and biochemical properties of the involucrum, as these may hold clues to the aquatic adaptations of cetaceans. We compared bioapatites (enamel, dentine, cementum, and skeletal bone) of cetaceans with those of terrestrial artiodactyls and pachyosteosclerotic ribs of manatees (Sirenia). We investigated organic, carbonate, and mineral composition as well as crystal size and crystallinity index. In all studied variables, bioapatites of the cetacean involucrum were intermediate in composition and structure between those of tooth enamel on the one hand and those of dentine, cementum, and skeletal bone on the other. We also studied the amino acid composition of the cetacean involucrum relative to that of other skeletal bone. The central involucrum had low glycine and hydroxyproline concentrations but high concentrations of nonessential amino acids, unlike most bone samples but similar to the tympanic of hippos and the (pachyosteosclerotic) ribs of manatees. These amino acid results are evidence of rapid bone development. We hypothesize that the mineralogical and amino acid composition of cetacean bullae differs from that of other bone because of (1) functional modifications for underwater sound reception and (2) structural adaptations related to rapid ossification.

For the former, birds have a system of at least three independent circadian clocks present in the retina of the eyes, the pineal gland, and the hypothalamus. This differs from the situation in mammals in which the input, pacemaker, and output are localized in different structures. Each bird clock interacts with at least one other clock, and together, they appear to form a centralized clock system that keeps daily time. These clocks have a powerful endogenous component, and the daily lightdark cycle entrains them to 24 h. The timing and duration of life history stages that make up annual cycle of an individual must also be controlled by some form of timekeeping. However, evidence for the existence of an equivalent endogenous circannual clock is less clear.

30161077|Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was established as a common reference point allowing comparable measures across different individuals and species. BMR is often regarded as a minimal rate of metabolism compatible with basic processes necessary to sustain life. One confusing aspect, however, is that BMR is highly variable, both within and between species. A potential explanation for this variability is that while individuals with high BMRs may suffer the disadvantage of having to feed for longer to cover the extra energy demands, this may be offset by advantages that accrue because of the high metabolic rate. One suggested advantage is that high levels of BMR are a consequence of maintaining a morphology that permits high rates of the maximal sustained rate of metabolism (SusMR)the rate of metabolism that can be sustained for days or weeks. We have been studying the energetics of MF1 laboratory mice during peak lactation to investigate this idea. In this article, we review some of our work in connection with three particular predictions that derive from the hypothesised links among morphology, basal metabolism, and sustained metabolic rate. By comparing groups of individuals, for example, lactating and nonlactating individuals, the patterns that emerge are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that BMR and SusMR are linked by morphology. Lactating mice have bigger organs connected with energy acquisition and utilisation, greater resting metabolic rates in the thermoneutral zone, called RMRt (approximately equivalent to BMR), and high sustainable rates of maximal energy intake. However, when attempts are made to establish these relationships across individuals within lactating mice, the associations that are anticipated are either absent or very weak and depend on shared variation due to body mass. At this level there is very little support for the suggestion that variation in RMRt (and thus BMR) is sustained by associations with SusMR.

30160095|Mammalian terrestrial locomotion has many unifying principles. However, the Macropodoidea are a particularly interesting group that exhibit a number of significant deviations from the principles that seem to apply to other mammals. While the properties of materials that comprise the musculoskeletal system of mammals are similar, evidence suggests that tendon properties in macropodoid marsupials may be size or function dependent, in contrast to the situation in placental mammals. Postural differences related to hopping versus running have a dramatic effect on the scaling of the pelvic limb musculoskeletal system. Ratios of muscle fibre to tendon crosssectional areas for ankle extensors and digital flexors scale with positive allometry in all mammals, but exponents are significantly higher in macropods. Tendon safety factors decline with increasing body mass in mammals, with eutherians at risk of ankle extensor tendon rupture at a body mass of about 150 kg, whereas kangaroos encounter similar problems at a body mass of approximately 35 kg. Tendon strength appears to limit locomotor performance in these animals. Elastic strain energy storage in tendons is mass dependent in all mammals, but exponents are significantly larger in macropodid. Tibial stresses may scale with positive allometry in kangaroos, which result in lower bone safety factors in macropods compared to eutherian mammals.

30161157|Through functional analyses, integrative physiology is able to link molecular biology with ecology as well as evolutionary biology and is thereby expected to provide access to the evolution of molecular, cellular, and organismic functions; the genetic basis of adaptability; and the shaping of ecological patterns. This paper compiles several exemplary studies of thermal physiology and ecology, carried out at various levels of biological organization from single genes (proteins) to ecosystems. In each of those examples, tradeoffs and constraints in thermal adaptation are addressed; these tradeoffs and constraints may limit species' distribution and define their level of fitness. For a more comprehensive understanding, the paper sets out to elaborate the functional and conceptual connections among these independent studies and the various organizational levels addressed. This effort illustrates the need for an overarching concept of thermal adaptation that encompasses molecular, organellar, cellular, and wholeorganism information as well as the mechanistic links between fitness, ecological success, and organismal physiology. For this data, the hypothesis of oxygen and capacitylimited thermal tolerance in animals provides such a conceptual framework and allows interpreting the mechanisms of thermal limitation of animals as relevant at the ecological level. While, ideally, evolutionary studies over multiple generations, illustrated by an example study in bacteria, are necessary to test the validity of such complex concepts and underlying hypotheses, animal physiology frequently is constrained to functional studies within one generation. Comparisons of populations in a latitudinal cline, closely related species from different climates, and ontogenetic stages from riverine clines illustrate how evolutionary information can still be gained. An understanding of temperaturedependent shifts in energy turnover, associated with adjustments in aerobic scope and performance, will result. This understanding builds on a mechanistic analysis of the width and location of thermal windows on the temperature scale and also on study of the functional properties of relevant proteins and associated gene expression mechanisms.

30161008|We examined the physical properties of digesta from the proximal (sacciform) and distal (tubiform) regions of the forestomach of tammar and parma wallabies maintained on a ryegrass sward. The digesta exhibited high viscosity, which, in conjunction with low flow rates calculated from published retention times of particulate marker in the stomach, results in a low potential for macrofluid mixing during onflow of food by displacement. The pseudoplastic nature of the viscosity profile and very low flow behavior index also indicate that macrofluid mixing around haustrae would be very localized. These findings indicate that the uniform mixing of whole digesta required for continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) is unlikely. Voidage, the proportion of digesta not occupied by solid material, and consistency index were greater in the digesta from the proximal than in the distal regions of the forestomach. We conclude that the mixing conditions in wallaby stomachs are better described as a partially emptying batch reactor (PEBR) than a CSTR series and that lower permeabilities in conjunction with higher viscosities decrease axial mixing and thus increase efficiency in PEBRs.
30158133|In most anurans, the production of advertisement calls is accompanied by the inflation of a vocal sac. Current functions of the vocal sac, however, are not fully understood, although several hypotheses have been proposed. One hypothesis suggests that the vocal sac decreases the intercall interval (i.e., increases call rate) by reinflating the lungs more rapidly than is possible with the buccal pump. We investigate this hypothesis by analyzing audio and video recordings of calling tngara frogs. We compare the first two call bouts emitted by an originally uninflated male. The first call bout requires lung inflation via buccal pumping, but in the second, the male is already inflated because of capture of air and reinflation of the lungs by the vocal sac. Lung inflation to typical field levels requires 2651 buccal pumps, which takes at least 4.4 s. This estimate is more than 2.5 times the typical intercall interval with lung reinflation via a vocal sac (ca. 1.7 s). Evidence from phonotaxis tests demonstrates that these differences in intercall intervals are salient to females and that female

30160097|The best supported hypothesis for the evolutionary origin of insect wings is that they evolved from articulated, legderived respiratory structures of aquatic ancestors. However, there are no fossils of the immediate ancestors of winged insects, and it is difficult to imagine how a functional transition from gills to wings could have occurred. Recent studies of surfaceskimming locomotion in stoneflies and mayflies offer a plausible solution by showing how rudimentary wings and muscle power can be used to accomplish twodimensional aerodynamic locomotion on the surface of water. Here we extend that line of research by examining the phylogenetic distribution and mechanistic diversity of surface skimming in stoneflies, along with a limited examination of mayflies. These investigations reveal both a broad taxonomic occurrence and a fine gradation of mechanically distinct forms. Distinct forms of wingflapping surface skimming include (1) stoneflies that flap their wings weakly while maintaining their body in contact with the water and undulating their abdomen laterally in a swimminglike motion, (2) stoneflies that skim while elevating their body above the water and maintaining all six legs on the surface, (3) stoneflies and mayflies that skim with only four legs on the water surface, (4) stoneflies that skim with only their two hind legs on the surface, and (5) stoneflies that, beginning with a series of leg motions nearly identical to hindleg skimmers, use their hind legs to jump from the water into the air to initiate flapping flight. Comparisons across these forms of skimming show that wingbeat amplitude, horizontal velocity, and the verticality of aerodynamic force production increase as the body orientation becomes more upright and contact with the water is minimized. These behaviors illustrate a mechanical pathway by which flying insects could have evolved from swimming ancestors via a series of finely graded intermediate stages. The phylogenetic distribution of skimming and flight in stoneflies does not indicate any clear directionality toward either greater or lesser aerodynamic abilities; however, the broad and apparently basal phylogenetic distribution of skimming taxa supports the hypothesis that the common ancestor of stoneflies was a surface skimmer. This may also be true for the common ancestor of stoneflies and mayflies, that is, the first winged insects. We combine these data with fossil evidence to form a synthetic model for the evolution of flying insects from surface skimmers.
30162236|The efficiency with which mothers convert acquired energy into milk is a key determinant of the magnitude of parental investment in mammals; however, the mechanisms underlying lactation efficiency are poorly understood. Investigations on northern elephant seals have shown lactation efficiency, measured as the proportion of total energy expenditure that goes to the pup as milk, increases with age. In a crosssectional study the physiological and behavioral determinants of lactation efficiency were investigated in eight young and seven prime (older) elephant seals by conducting behavioral observations and collecting milk, blood, and tissue on days 3 and 22 of lactation. Milk composition, circulating fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations, and mammary and blubber lipoprotein lipase activity were determined. Prime females had significantly greater percent milk fat and circulating fatty acids on day 3 than did young females, but these differences disappeared by day 22. The ability for prime females to produce higherenergy milk early in lactation may allow them to increase lactation efficiency by increasing the rate of energy transfer. In addition, prime females spent significantly more time resting. A combination of reduced activity and more rapid energy delivery likely explains the increase in lactation efficiency with age found in a previous study.

30160011|Plasma cortisol elevation, a common consequence of stress, occurs in salmonids of subordinate rank; these fish acquire a smaller share of available food and grow more slowly. This study examined the role of cortisol itself in these phenomena. Cortisol implants, with parallel sham and control treatments, were used to create a chronic threefold elevation in plasma cortisol levels in juvenile rainbow trout, and the individual feeding patterns of the fish were evaluated using Xray radiography. The three treatment groups were (1) held alone and fed to satiation, thereby providing a measure of voluntary appetite, or mixed together in equal proportions and fed to either (2) satiation or (3) halfsatiation, thereby allowing assessment of the additional effects of competitive interaction and food limitation. Chronic plasma cortisol elevation had significant negative effects on individual appetite, growth rate, condition factor, and food conversion efficiency, independent of whether the fish were held under unmixed or mixed conditions. Under the latter, mean share of meal was reduced and fin damage increased in cortisoltreated fish; negative growth effects were more severe with food limitation, but the response patterns were otherwise unchanged. Even in the absence of other groups, cortisoltreated fish showed more variable feeding patterns. When compared at the same individual ration levels, cortisoltreated fish had lower growth rates, reflecting a higher cost of living. Cortisol treatment had no effect on aerobic swimming performance. These results suggest that the structure of the feeding hierarchy may not be determined solely by competitive ability but may also be greatly influenced by differences in the feeding behaviour of unstressed fish versus stressed fish caused by cortisol elevation in the latter.

FAs from adipose tissue are selectively mobilized according to their carbon length (CL) and number of double bonds (DBs); however, studies in vivo have focused only on fasting and nonlactating animals. During lactation, UK gray seals fast for 18 d, mobilizing a large amount of lipid from blubber to sustain their own metabolic demands and the nutritional requirements of pups. We investigated FA mobilization in individual gray seal mothers from two UK colonies sampled in 2005 and 2006. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine to what extent the mobilization observed from FAs in blubber can be explained as a function of FAs CL and number of DBs. FAs were mobilized according to their structure, such that for a given CL, mobilization increased with the number of DBs, and for a given number of DBs, mobilization decreased as CL increased. This pattern of selective mobilization was very similar between colonies, although the relative amounts of component FAs in blubber at early lactation were different between them. FAs, which are considered crucial to pup development, were mobilized more than predicted by the model. This suggests that selective mobilization of FAs is not related solely to the physicochemical characteristics of the FAs but also to the needs of a growing pup.

BMR determines some of the key variables of the model, but no combination of the variables determines BMR.

30161177|Aspiration breathing is the dominant mechanism of lung inflation among extant amniotes. However, aspiration has two fundamental problems associated with it: paradoxical visceral translation and partial lung collapse. These can constrain the inspiratory tidal volume, reduce the effective lung ventilation, and ultimately curtail the aerobic capacity of an animal. Separation of the pleural and peritoneal cavities by an intracoelomic septum can restrict the cranial shift of abdominal viscera and provide structural support to the caudal lung surface. A muscular septum, such as the diaphragm of mammals or the diaphragmaticus of crocodilians, can exert active control over visceral translation and the degree of lung inflation. To a lesser degree, a nonmuscular septum can also function as a passive barrier when stretched taut by rib rotation. Studies of the posthepatic septum in teiid lizards and the postpulmonary septum in varanid lizards underscore the importance of nonmuscular septa in aspiration. These septa provide plausible functional models that help us infer the evolution of mammalian and avian lung ventilatory systems, respectively.

10.1086/666904|What is the effect of a variable environment on phenotypic variation? Does the physiological response to a new environment increase or decrease the differences among individuals? We provide a speculative hypothesis suggesting that the induction of a physiological response to environmental change minimizes phenotypic differences among individuals in outbred genetically variable populations. Although this suggestion runs counter to the general idea that environmental variation induces phenotypic variation, we provide evidence that this is not always the case. One explanation for this counterintuitive hypothesis is that in a variable environment, the physiological mechanism that maintains homeostasis changes the concentrations of active transcription factors (TFs). This change in TFs reduces the effectiveness of nucleotide polymorphisms in TF binding sites and thus reduces the variation among individuals in mRNA expression and in the phenotypes affected by these mRNA transcripts. Thus, there are fewer differences among individuals in a variable environment compared with the variation observed in a constant environment. Our conjecture is that the physiological mechanisms that maintain homeostasis in response to environmental variation canalize phenotypic variation. If our hypothesis is correct, then the physiological canalization of gene expression in a variable environment hides genetic variation and thereby reduces the evolutionary costs of polymorphism. This hypothesis provides a new perspective on the mechanisms by which high levels of genetic variation can persist in real-world populations.

The examples discussed here illustrate how recent progress in the field of comparative physiology may provide a better mechanistic understanding of the ecological concepts of the fundamental and realized niches and thus provide insights into the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance. Here we argue that, as a link between physiological and ecological indicators of organismal performance, the mechanisms shaping aerobic scope and passive tolerance set the dimensions of an animals niche, here defined as its capacity to survive, grow, behave, and interact with other species. We demonstrate how comparative studies of cod or killifish populations in a latitudinal cline have unraveled mitochondrial mechanisms involved in establishing a species niche, performance, and energy budget. Riverine fish exemplify how the performance windows of various developmental stages follow the dynamic regimes of both seasonal temperatures and river hydrodynamics, as synergistic challenges. Finally, studies of species in extreme environments, such as the tilapia of Lake Magadi, illustrate how on evolutionary timescales functional and morphological shifts can occur, associated with new specializations. We conclude that research on the processes and time course of adaptations suitable to overcome current niche limits is urgently needed to assess the resilience of species and ecosystems to human impact, including the challenges of global climate change.

30158690|Flying animals may experience a selective constraint on gut volume because the energetic cost of flight increases and maneuverability decreases with greater digesta load. The small intestine is the primary site of absorption of most nutrients (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, fat) in both birds and mammals. Therefore, we used a phylogenetically informed approach to compare small intestine morphometric measurements of birds with those of nonflying mammals and to test for effects of diet within each clade. We also compared the fit of nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic models to test for phylogenetic signal after accounting for effects of body mass, clade, and/or diet. We provide a new MATLAB program (Regressionv2.m) that facilitates a flexible modelfitting approach in comparative studies. As compared with nonflying mammals, birds had 51% less nominal small intestine surface area (area of a smooth bore tube) and 32% less volume. For animals <365 g in body mass, birds also had significantly shorter small intestines (20%33% shorter, depending on body mass). Diet was also a significant factor explaining variation in small intestine nominal surface area of both birds and nonflying mammals, small intestine mass of mammals, and small intestine volume of both birds and nonflying mammals. On the basis of the phylogenetic trees used in our analyses, small intestine length and nominal surface area exhibited statistically significant phylogenetic signal in birds but not in mammals. Thus, for birds, related species tended to be similar in small intestine length and nominal surface area, even after accounting for relations with body mass and diet. A reduced small intestine in birds may decrease the capacity for breakdown and active absorption of nutrients. Birds do not seem to compensate for reduced digestive and absorptive capacity via a longer gut retention time of food, but we found some evidence that birds have an increased mucosal surface area via a greater villus area, although not enough to compensate for reduced nominal surface area. We predict that without increased rate of enzyme hydrolysis and/or mediated transport and without increased passive absorption of watersoluble nutrients, birds may operate with a reduced digestive capacity, compared with that of nonflying mammals, to meet an increase in metabolic needs (i.e., a reduced spare capacity).

Much less is known, however, about the potential effects of other types of dietary lipids. One study demonstrated that increasing dietary cholesterol levels during fall feeding increased torpor bout length and also decreased minimum body temperatures during hibernation by chipmunks. Another hibernation study with ground squirrels revealed that the cholesterol contents of both the cerebral cortex and the microsomes were significantly greater during arousal episodes than during torpor bouts, suggesting that cholesterol plays a role in preserving brain function during torpor. We thus predicted that dietary cholesterol enhances daily torpor in mammals as well. We also predicted that the level of cholesterol found in mammalian brain tissues during daily torpor increases with that of the diet. These hypotheses were tested in a series of laboratory feeding and daily torpor experiments involving Siberian hamsters (

A previous comparative study of 12 species of European lacertid lizards found a statistically significant negative correlation between residual locomotor speed and stamina (controlling for variation in body size), consistent with ideas about trade-offs in performance based on variation in muscle fiber type composition and other subordinate traits. To begin examining the generality of this finding in other groups of squamates, we measured maximal sprint running speed on a high-speed treadmill and endurance at 1.0 km/h (0.28 m/s) in 14 species of North American phrynosomatid lizards, plus a sample of nine additional species to encompass some of the broadscale diversity of lizards. We used both conventional and phylogenetically informed regression analyses to control for some known causes of performance variation (body size, stockiness, body temperature) and then computed residual performance values. We found no evidence for a trade-off between speed and endurance among the 14 phrynosomatids or among the 23 species in the extended data set. Possible explanations for the apparent difference between lacertids and phrynosomatids are discussed.

30161184|The manipulation of egg content is one of the few ways by which female birds can alter offspring quality before hatch. Lipidsoluble vitamins and carotenoids are potent antioxidants. Female birds deposit these antioxidants into eggs in variable amounts according to environmental and social conditions, and the quantities deposited into eggs can have effects on offspring health and immunological condition. Allocation theory posits that females will alter the distribution of resources according to mate quality, sometimes allocating resources according to the differential allocation hypothesis (DAH), investing more in offspring sired by betterquality males, and other times allocating resources according to a compensatory strategy, enhancing the quality of offspring sired by lowerquality males. It is unknown, however, whether antioxidants are deposited into eggs according to the DAH or a compensatory strategy.

30160585|Redox signaling has emerged as a unifying theme in many seemingly disparate disciplines. Such signaling has been widely studied in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles and is often mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this context, reduced glutathione (GSH) acts as an important intracellular antioxidant, diminishing ROS and potentially affecting redox signaling. Complementing this celllevel perspective, colonial hydroids can be a useful model for understanding organismlevel redox signaling. These simple, earlyevolving animals consist of feeding polyps connected by tubelike stolons. Colonies treated exogenously with GSH or reduced glutathione ethyl ester (GEE) were expected to show a morphological change to sheetlike growth typical of low levels of ROS. Contrary to expectations, diminished stolon branching and polyp initiation was observed. Such runnerlike growth is associated with higher levels of ROS, and surprisingly, such higher levels were found in GSH and GEEtreated colonies. Further investigations show that GSH triggered a feeding response in hydroid polyps, increasing oxygen uptake but at the same time relaxing mitochondrionrich contractile regions at the base of polyps. Diminished gastrovascular flow and increased emissions of mitochondrial ROS also correlated with the observed runnerlike growth. In contrast to celllevel, bottomup views of redox signaling, here the phenotype may arise from a topdown interaction of mitochondrionrich regions and organismlevel physiology. Such multicellular redox regulation may commonly occur in other animals as well.

The aim of this study is to investigate the physiological costs of mounting an immune response during gestation in an ectothermic species.

Although several advantages of endothermy are easy to indicate, mechanisms behind evolution of such a wasteful life strategy remain unclear and have been subject to intensive debate. For two decades, the aerobic capacity model has been widely recognized as a promising hypothesis and has catalyzed a new direction in ecological and evolutionary physiologythe study of correlated evolution of behavioral and morphophysiological traits. Recently, two alternative models have been proposed, both of which see evolution of high metabolic rates in birds and mammals as an element in evolution of intensive parental care. Unlike previous models, which treated individuals as static objects of fixed properties, the parental care models explicitly incorporate life histories into a evolutionaryphysiology research program. The aim of this article was to outline the process of evolution of major concepts in the field, which reflects development of the paradigm of modern evolutionary physiology.

Although long-term fasting is common in a number of species, it has been reported to be detrimental for the organism, notably because it induces oxidative stress. However, fasting metabolism is characterized by successive metabolic adaptations that are likely to be different in terms of stress, and no previous studies, to our knowledge, have tested the dynamics of changes in oxidative balance in relation to the metabolic phases of fasting. Our study provides a first insight into this relationship by inducing prolonged fasting and subsequent refeeding in captive mallards (

This required expansion of the cardiopulmonary systems capacity for gas exchange, but while directional selection for this expanded capacity resulted in extremely similar avian and mammalian hearts, strikingly different lungs arose, and the reasons for this divergence in lung morphology are not understood. In birds, gas exchange occurs in the lungs as air moves through small tubes (parabronchi) in one direction; in mammals, air flows tidally into and out of the alveoli. Here, I present a scenario for the origin of both the alveolar and parabronchial lungs that explains when and how they could have arisen by a gradual sequence of steps. I argue that (1) the alveolar lung evolved in the late Paleozoic, when high levels of atmospheric oxygen relaxed selection for a thin bloodgas barrier within the lung; (2) unidirectional flow originated in the ectothermic ancestral archosaur, the forerunner of birds and crocodilians, to enable the heart to circulate pulmonary gases during apnea. This hypothesis would be supported by a demonstration of unidirectional flow in the lungs of crocodilians, the extant sister taxon of birds. Airflow in the lungs of juvenile alligators was measured during apnea using dual thermistor flowmeters, and cardiac activity was measured with electrocardiography. Coincident with each heartbeat, a pulse of air flowed in the pulmonary conduit under study with a bias in the direction of movement, yielding a net unidirectional flow. These data suggest the internal structures requisite for unidirectional flow were present in the common ancestors of birds and crocodilians and may have preadapted the lungs of archosaurs to function advantageously during the oxygenpoor period of the early Mesozoic.

10.1086/671109|Physiological vagility represents the capacity to move sustainably and is central to fully explaining the processes involved in creating fine-scale genetic structure of amphibian populations, because movement (vagility) and the duration of movement determine the dispersal distance individuals can move to interbreed. The tendency for amphibians to maintain genetic differentiation over relatively short distances (isolation by distance) has been attributed to their limited dispersal capacity (low vagility) compared with other vertebrates. Earlier studies analyzing genetic isolation and population differentiation with distance treat all amphibians as equally vagile and attempt to explain genetic differentiation only in terms of physical environmental characteristics. We introduce a new quantitative metric for vagility that incorporates aerobic capacity, body size, body temperature, and the cost of transport and is independent of the physical characteristics of the environment. We test our metric for vagility with data for dispersal distance and body mass in amphibians and correlate vagility with data for genetic differentiation (
30158725|Many birds switch seasonally or during ontogeny between diets of varying protein content. In mammals, highprotein diets induce hypertrophy of the kidney in general and of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) in particular, along with increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and urine flow. A hypothesis to explain these phenomena is that the TAL become increasingly sensitive to peptide hormones (glucagon and antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) released in response to protein feeding; the consequent enhancement of ion reabsorption dilutes urine reaching the macula densa, thereby suppressing tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) and causing a rise in GFR. Avian kidneys possess most of the elements involved in this mechanism, including loops of Henle with TAL, sensitivity of TAL to ADH (arginine vasotocin [AVT] in birds), and the elements of TGF. We therefore hypothesized that switching from a lowprotein to a highprotein diet would induce responses in birds similar to those found in mammals. We tested this hypothesis by feeding house sparrows,

This study examined the influence of thermal acclimation on diving behavior, aquatic respiration, and locomotor performance in the endangered, bimodally respiring Mary River turtle
10.1086/667532|Teeth are generally used for actions in which they experience mainly compressive forces acting toward the base. The ordered tooth enamel(oid) and dentin structures contribute to the high compressive strength but also to the minor shear and tensile strengths. Some vertebrates, however, use their teeth for scraping, with teeth experiencing forces directed mostly normal to their long axis. Some scraping suckermouth catfishes (Loricariidae) even appear to have flexible teeth, which have not been found in any other vertebrate taxon. Considering the mineralized nature of tooth tissues, the notion of flexible teeth seems paradoxical. We studied teeth of five species, testing and measuring tooth flexibility, and investigating tooth (micro)structure using transmission electron microscopy, staining, computed tomography scanning, and scanning electron microscopyenergy-dispersive spectrometry. We quantified the extreme bending capacity of single teeth (up to 180) and show that reorganizations of the tooth (micro)structure and extreme hypomineralization of the dentin are adaptations preventing breaking by allowing flexibility. Tooth shape and internal structure appear to be optimized for bending in one direction, which is expected to occur frequently when feeding (scraping) under natural conditions. Not all loricariid catfishes possess flexible teeth, with the trait potentially having evolved more than once. Flexible teeth surely rank among the most extreme evolutionary novelties in known mineralized biological materials and might yield a better understanding of the processes of dentin formation and (hypo)mineralization in vertebrates, including humans.
30160625|Rates of oxygen consumption during begging behaviour in nestlings of seven species and distress call behaviour in adults of eight species of Australian birds were measured. A transparent mask coupled to an openflow respirometry system was used, and calling was elicited by the presentation of food or by the perceived threat of a predator. Distress calling significantly increased oxygen consumption above the measured resting levels in six of the species of birds tested. The factorial increase in oxygen consumption during distress calling was independent of body mass. In most cases, begging behaviour in juvenile birds caused a significant increase in metabolic rate, with some individuals showing factorial increases over fourfold. There was a significant negative correlation between body mass and the factorial cost of begging behaviour.
10.1086/591948|Morphometrics and blubber depths from all four high Antarctic seals (Weddell, Ross, crabeater, and leopard) were obtained during a midsummer research cruise in the Ross Sea as the physiological ecology component of the U.S. Antarctic Pack Ice Seals project. These data are the only in vivo measurements of all four species from the same location and time of year and focused on variances in morphometrics and blubber depth related to species, sex, and age. By controlling for location and season, this crossspecies design provided the means to differentiate how blubber mass might be influenced in these groups. We measured both absolute blubber depth and ratio of blubber depth to body core diameter. We found that adult and younger animals showed differences in blubber depth, but male versus female seals did not show differences within any given species. However, when compared across species, the ratio of blubber ring depth to body core diameter suggests that adult Weddell seals differ in their use of blubber compared with the other three species. We propose that this difference in blubber pattern is most likely related to Weddell nutritional requirements during the breeding season having a greater influence on blubber depth than thermal requirements when compared with the other three species.

In the firsts part of this study, a comparative experiment, which included five different species of grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) representing three separate taxonomic groups, was performed to determine how widespread sterol metabolic constraints are within the Acrididae. Grasshoppers were reared on artificial diets containing sterols that differed in the position of double bonds within the sterol structure, and various life history traits were measured. Sterols with double bonds at position 7, within the sterol nucleus, and/or at position 22, on the cholestane side chain, failed to support development to the adult stage for any of the five species. In addition, grasshoppers reared on sterols with these configurations often had extended developmental times and reduced growth rates in the first and second stadium compared with grasshoppers reared on sitosterol or cholesterol diets.

10.1086/680383|The choice of adequate breeding habitat and its associated thermoregulatory conditions are thought to be important in the evolution of amphibian reproductive strategies. Among leptodactylid frogs, there is a terrestrial cline in the oviposition sites chosen to build foam nests for eggs. Although several functions have been attributed to foam nests, their role in temperature regulation for embryos is unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that foam nests buffer embryos from variation in air temperature. We examined the degree of terrestrial nest sites in three species, finding a terrestrial cline of sites in terms of distance from water. We tested whether this nest-insulation effect varied among these species that differ in the degree of terrestrial nest sites and whether translocating nests impacted embryonic mortality. Our results demonstrate a negative effect of translocating aquatic nests to land, inferred from the highest hatching success in natural nests sites. All nests attenuated environmental thermal variation, but more terrestrial nests buffered embryos from a greater range of temperatures than did aquatic ones. Altogether, our data indicate that foam nests insulate embryos from daily temperature fluctuations among leptodactylid frogs with different degrees of terrestrial nests, which may well have contributed to the evolution of this reproductive strategy.

30161130|Growing juvenile animals undergo many morphological, physiological, and behavioural changes that influence their energetic requirements, patterns of energy use, and ultimately, their survival and reproductive success. We examined changes in mass loss and body composition of juvenile southern elephant seals (1 and 2yrolds) during their two annual haulouts. At the start and end of the midyear and molt haulouts, we caught, weighed, and measured 41 and 14 seals, respectively. We measured blubber depth using ultrasound to estimate body composition (lean and adipose tissue mass). Using energy densities of the adipose and lean tissue, we calculated total, lean, and adipose mass changes and energy expenditure. While molting, juvenile seals used more energy than during the midyear, which is related to the increased use of lean tissue for hair and skin regeneration. The amount of energy used increases with mass as individuals mature. We found sexual differences in energy use where females retained greater fat reserves than males by utilizing more lean tissue. These differences are most likely related to haulout function and behavior, growth, and earlier development of females toward sexual maturity.

30158103|During northward migration, blackcaps that arrive to refuel at stopover sites in Israels Negev Desert have reduced masses of organs that are important in food digestion and assimilation. We tested several predictions from the general hypothesis that smaller organs of digestion (small intestine and pancreas) and nutrient assimilation (liver) bring about a lower capacity to consume food and that the organs must be restored before blackcaps can feed and digest at a high rate. We used a fasting protocol to create a group of blackcaps with reduced intestine and liver mass (reduced by 45% and 36%, respectively) compared with controls fed ad lib. Because most of the small intestines biochemical digestive capacity reside in enterocytes found on villi, we predicted and found that reduced intestinal mass in fasted blackcaps related mainly to changes in enterocytes rather than other cells and tissues such as nonabsorptive crypt cells or underlying muscle. Because migrating blackcaps that stop over to feed begin to increase in body mass only 2 d after arrival, we predicted and found a similar recovery period in blackcaps that were first fasted but then refedthe organ mass, structure, function, and ability to consume food was restored after 2 d of feeding. Another group of foodrestricted blackcaps (fed at onethird ad lib. level) lost similar amounts of body mass as fasted blackcaps but had much greater capacity to consume food than fasted blackcaps, and so we predicted that they would exhibit little or no reduction in alimentary organs relative to controls fed ad lib. A surprising result was that, as in fasted blackcaps, in foodrestricted blackcaps, the decreases in masses of small intestine, liver, and pancreas were proportionally greater than the decreases in body mass or in masses of nonalimentary organs (heart, pectoralis). Food restriction, like fasting, caused a decrease in amount of intestinal mucosa and an alteration in the phenotype of enterocytes. These results are thus not consistent with the general hypothesis, and although they can be rationalized by assuming that blackcaps fed ad lib. have excess digestive capacity, it may also be that the physiological process or processes limiting very high feeding rate lie elsewhere than in the digestive system.

The lowdensity form is small and cryptic and moves <1 m/d, while the highdensity form is large and dark colored and travels up to 12 km/d in migratory bands. We determined daytime body temperatures and measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) and maximal aerobic metabolic rate (MMR) in forced exercise across a 1040C temperature range. Field body temperatures were 1520C in the morning and 2535C during most of the day, and they never exceeded 40.6C in either form. Massadjusted RMR and MMR were positively correlated across temperatures (significantly in some comparisons), indicating repeatability. Similarly, RMR was always positively and sometimes significantly correlated with MMR, suggesting a functional linkage between minimal and maximal aerobic performance. Factorial aerobic scopes (MMR/RMR) were highest at 10C and declined at higher temperatures, but absolute scope (MMR  RMR) was highest between 30 and 40C. Given the ca. 1,000fold contrast in daily movement distances, we expected higher MMR and aerobic scope in the migratory highdensity form.

We examined sprint speeds and maximal enzyme activities in whitemuscle biopsies at each period. We measured the glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the mitochondrial enzyme, cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), and the biosynthetic enzyme, nucleotide diphosphate kinase (NDPK). Sprint speeds were measured in a laser diode/photocelltimed raceway. As expected, the feeding regime had a marked impact on the physiological capacities of cod, but the responses differed for sprintswimming and muscle metabolic capacities. The different enzyme activities as well the condition index generally decreased during the first starvation, improved with feeding, and fell again during the second starvation. In contrast, sprint performance improved after feeding but did not fall with the second starvation. Although both the enzyme activities and the sprint speeds showed considerable interindividual variation, sprint speeds were not significantly correlated with the enzyme activities. The hierarchy of sprint performance of the cod was maintained, regardless of the preceding feeding regime, whereas those of muscle metabolic capacities were not.
10.1086/651460|We studied the energetics of hoverfeeding Annas hummingbirds, using three different simultaneous techniques: heat loss as estimated via thermal imaging, metabolic rate as measured at a feeder mask using flowthrough respirometry, and aerodynamic power estimated from wingbeat kinematic data. These three methods yielded comparable estimates of power output at ambient air temperatures ranging from 18 to 26C, whereas heat imbalance at higher air temperatures (up to 34C) suggested loss by mechanisms other than convection and radiation from the body, such as evaporative cooling and enthalpy rise associated with exhaled air and excreted water and convective heat loss from the patagia. Hummingbirds increased wingbeat frequency and decreased stroke amplitude as air temperature increased, but overall muscle efficiency was found to be approximately constant over the experimental range of air temperatures.

30158379|Physiological strategies that maximize reproductive success may be phylogenetically constrained or might have a plastic response to different environmental conditions. Among mammals, Canidae lend themselves to the study of these two influences on reproductive physiology because all the species studied to date have been characterized as monestrous (i.e., a single ovulatory event per breeding season), suggesting a phylogenetic effect. Greater flexibility could be associated with environments that are less seasonal, such as the tropics; however, little is known for many of the species from this region. To compensate for this lack of data, two regressions were done on the length of the reproductive season relative to the latitudinal distribution of a species: one with raw data and another with phylogenetically independent contrasts. There was a significant negative relationship, independent of phylogeny, with canids that have longer breeding seasons occurring at lower latitudes. In contrast, the pervasiveness of monestrus within Canidae appears to be phylogenetically constrained by their pairing/packing life and is most likely associated with monogamy. The persistence of the monestrous condition is supported by a captive study where a tropical canid, the fennec fox,

30160978|Allometric equations can be useful in comparative physiology in a number of ways, not the least of which include assessing whether a particular species deviates from the norm for its size and phylogenetic group with respect to some specific physiological process or determining how differences in design among groups may be reflected in differences in function. The allometric equations for respiratory variables in birds were developed 30 yr ago by Lasiewski and Calder and presented as preliminary because they were based on a small number of species. With the expanded data base now available to reconstruct these allometries and the call for taking account of the nonindependence of species in this process through a phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC) approach, we have developed new allometric equations for respiratory variables in birds using both the traditional and PIC approaches. On the whole, the new equations agree with the old ones with only minor changes in the coefficients, and the primary difference between the traditional and PIC approaches is in the broader confidence intervals given by the latter.

30161311|Individual rainbow trout were transferred to visual isolation in experimental aquaria. As a measure of the speed of acclimation, individual food intake was quantified during the first 6 d following transfer. Following acclimation, aggression was quantified by subjecting the fish to three residentintruder tests, with 30 d of recovery between the tests. Moreover, between the residentintruder tests (i.e., two times) the fish were exposed to an unfamiliar environment and their cortisol response was measured. The results of this study show that individuals of juvenile rainbow trout differ distinctly in their response to changes in their environment, and that this diversity in behavior is reflected by consistent behavioral traits displayed by individual fish. These traits have proven to be consistent not only over time but also across situations, revealing two distinct behavioral profiles, in the same manner as shown in studies on proactive and reactive mammals. Our results also show that the reactivity of the hypothalamicpituitaryinterrenal (HPI) axis, when exposed to a stressor, is a consistent physiological trait in juvenile rainbow trout. We found that difference in HPI axis reactivity is linked to the different behavioral profiles. However, HPI axis reactivity could not be linked directly to the singular behavioral traits measured. In other words, we did not find that the consistent behavioral traits shown by the fish were associated with a difference in HPI axis reactivity in the same manner as the reactivity of the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenocortical axis does in mammals. Taken together, our results show that stress coping strategies akin to what has been described as reactive and proactive stress coping in mammals appear to exist in juvenile rainbow trout.

How these differences in life history at the organismal level are rooted in differences at the cellular level is a major focus of current research. Here, we cultured fibroblasts from phylogenetically paired tropical and temperate species, isolated mitochondria from each, and compared their mitochondrial membrane lipids. We also correlated the amounts of these lipids with an important life history parameter, clutch size. We found that tropical birds tended to have less mitochondrial lipid per cell, especially less cardiolipin per cell, suggesting that cells from tropical birds have fewer mitochondria or less inner mitochondrial membrane per cell. We also found that the mitochondria of tropical birds and the species with the smallest clutch sizes had higher amounts of plasmalogens, a lipid that could serve as an antioxidant. Overall, our findings are consistent with the idea that there are underlying molecular and cellular physiological traits that could account for the differences in whole-animal physiology between animals with different life histories.

30161155|Incubation temperature influences hatchling phenotypes such as sex, size, shape, color, behavior, and locomotor performance in many reptiles, and there is growing concern that global warming might adversely affect reptile populations by altering frequencies of hatchling phenotypes. Here I overview a recent theoretical model used to predict hatchling sex of reptiles with temperaturedependent sex determination. This model predicts that sex ratios will be fairly robust to moderate global warming as long as eggs experience substantial daily cyclic fluctuations in incubation temperatures so that embryos are exposed to temperatures that inhibit embryonic development for part of the day. I also review studies that examine the influence of incubation temperature on posthatch locomotion performance and growth because these are the traits that are likely to have the greatest effect on hatchling fitness. The majority of these studies used artificial constanttemperature incubation, but some have addressed fluctuating incubation temperature regimes. Although the number of studies is small, it appears that fluctuating temperatures may enhance hatchling locomotor performance. This finding should not be surprising, given that the majority of natural reptile nests are relatively shallow and therefore experience daily fluctuations in incubation temperature.

However, fat stores cannot satisfy all reproductive resource demands, which include considerable investment of amino acids (e.g., for the production of yolk proteins or gluconeogenesis). Because capital breeders generally do not eat during reproduction, these amino acids must come from internal resources, typically muscle proteins. Although the energetic costs of reproduction have been fairly well studied, there are limited data on structural and performance costs associated with the muscle degradation required to meet amino acid demands.

In this study, we evaluated the relationship between total evaporative water loss and body mass in mammals by using a recent phylogenetic hypothesis. We compared total evaporative water loss in 80 species of arid-zone mammals to that in 56 species that inhabit mesic regions, ranging in size from 4 g to 3,500 kg, to test the hypothesis that mammals from arid environments have lower rates of total evaporative water loss than mammals from mesic environments once phylogeny is taken into account. We found that arid species had lower rates of total evaporative water loss than mesic species when using a dichotomous variable to describe habitat (arid or mesic). We also found that total evaporative water loss was negatively correlated with the average maximum and minimum environmental temperature as well as the maximum vapor pressure deficit of the environment.

Previous work examining scaling across beetle species and during ontogeny of grasshoppers suggests strong tracheal hypermetry, with larger insects investing relatively more volume in their tracheal systems. However, these approaches potentially confound body size differences with species or life stage differences in morphology or physiology. To circumvent these issues, we took advantage of large body size variation within bumblebee nests.

We provide evidence of a splicing event of a goldfish D2 (gfD2b1) receptor in the neuroendocrine brain of adult goldfish that produces a spliced short isoform (gfD2b1S). We also identify an additional novel D2b paralog (gfD2b2) that does not appear to be alternatively spliced in adult fish during the reproductive cycle. Relatively high mRNA levels of gfD2b1S were observed in the neuroendocrine brain and pituitary of sexually immature fish compared with sexually regressing fish. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that intraperitoneal injection of either SCH 23390 or sulpirideD1- or D2-specific antagonists, respectivelydecreased mRNA levels of gfD2b1S by 3.9-fold without affecting the unspliced isoforms. We suggest that the expression of the spliced D2 receptor modulates the inhibitory tone of DA throughout the reproductive cycle. The deduced amino acid sequence of gfD2b1S lacks 29 amino acids in the same region as the short isoform of mammalian D2. We propose that the gfD2b1S splice variant is the teleost ortholog of mammalian D2S. The hypothesis that D2 receptor splicing is a relatively recent innovation in higher tetrapods is not supported by our results.

In each line, three groups were created; one group in which the chicks were fed ad lib. and two other groups in which the chicks received 70% and 40% of the linespecific ad lib. feeding levels, respectively. In all three groups, chick survival rates were very high, and no relationship was detected between feeding level and chick mortality. The experimental feeding levels strongly affected the chicks attainment of body mass at all ages. In addition, at most ages the growth of the structural components (wing, tarsus, and head) were also significantly affected by the feeding experiment but to a much smaller extent than the body mass. The feeding levels also affected the achievement of female sexual maturity such that, at the end of the experiment, most of the ad lib.fed females and none of the females that received 40% of the ad lib. feeding level were laying eggs. In chicks of both lines that were fed ad lib., homeothermy was achieved at 7 d of age, but in chicks that received 40% of the linespecific ad lib. levels, homeothermy was achieved after 1522 d of age. Poikilothermic chicks (P and Cline) that were relatively heavy for their age exhibited relatively high resting metabolic rates (RMRs) and peak metabolic rates (PMRs) for their age. In addition, a positive relationship was found between the chicks relative mass and RMR (based on massbased predictive equations). No relationship was detected between the chicks relative body mass and their relative PMR (relative to massbased predictive equations). With respect to the metabolic scope (i.e.,
10.1086/679906|A critical window (sensitive period) represents a period during development when an organisms phenotype is responsive to intrinsic or extrinsic (environmental) factors. Such windows represent a form of developmental phenotypic plasticity and result from the interaction between genotype and environment. Critical windows have typically been defined as comprising discrete periods in development with a distinct starting time and end time, as identified by experiments following an on and an off protocol. Yet in reality, periods of responsiveness during development are likely more ambiguous that depicted. Our goal is to extend the concept of the developmental critical window by introducing a three-dimensional construct in which time during development, dose of the stressor applied, and the resultant phenotypic modification can be utilized to more realistically define a critical window.

30161075|In this article, we review intraspecific studies of basal metabolic rate (BMR) that address the correlation between diet quality and BMR. The foodhabit hypothesis stands as one of the most striking and oftenmentioned interspecific patterns to emerge from studies of endothermic energetics. Our main emphasis is the explicit empirical comparison of predictions derived from interspecific studies with data gathered from withinspecies studies in order to explore the mechanisms and functional significance of the putative adaptive responses encapsulated by the foodhabit hypothesis. We suggest that, in addition to concentrating on the relationship among diet quality, internal morphology, and BMR, new studies should also attempt to unravel alternative mechanisms that shape the interaction between diet and BMR, such as enzymatic plasticity, and the use of energysaving mechanisms, such as torpor. Another avenue for future study is the measurement of the effects of diet quality on other components of the energy budget, such as maximum thermogenic and sustainable metabolic rates. It is possible that the effects of diet quality operate on such components rather than directly on BMR, which might then push or pull along changes in these traits. Results from intraspecific studies suggest that the factors responsible for the association between diet and BMR at an ecological timescale might not be the same as those that promoted the evolution of this correlation. Further analyses should consider how much of a role the proximate and ultimate processes have played in the evolution of BMR.
30161047|Arousal from deep hibernation is accompanied by a transient rise of melatonin (Mel) in circulation; there are no comparable analyses of Mel concentrations in species that undergo much shallower, shorter duration episodes of daily torpor. Serum Mel concentrations were determined during arousal from both natural daily torpor and torpor induced by 2deoxyDglucose (2DG) treatment (2,500 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [IP]); blood samples were drawn from the retroorbital sinus of anesthetized Siberian hamsters. For animals kept in darkness during torpor, Mel concentrations were highest during early arousal when thermogenesis is maximal, and they decreased as body temperature increased during arousal and returned to baseline once euthermia was reestablished. In hamsters kept in the light during the torpor bout, Mel concentrations were elevated above basal values during arousal, but the response was significantly blunted in comparison with values recorded in darkness. Increased Mel concentrations were detected in hamsters only during arousal from torpor (either natural or 2DG induced) and were not simply a result of the drug treatment; hamsters that remained euthermic or manifested mild hypothermia after drug treatment maintained basal Mel concentrations. We propose that increased Mel production may reflect enhanced sympathetic activation associated with intense thermogenesis during arousal from torpor rather than an adjustment of the circadian rhythm of Mel secretion.

In terrestrial populations, exploring the physiological and environmental contributions to wholeanimal performance measures has improved our understanding of phenotypic selection. Conversely, very little is known about the links between phenotypic selection and swimming abilities in fish. Most research on swimming performance in fish has focused on morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits contributing to performance or has used swimming performance as a measure of environmental suitability. Few studies have explored how swimming performance is integrated with lifehistory traits or contributes to Darwinian fitness. In addition, while there are many studies on how the environment influences the swimming performance of fish, few have been done at the individual level. The objective of this study was to broaden our understanding of the relevance of fish swimming performance studies by testing the hypothesis that swimming performance (endurance and sprint) is ontogenetically and temporally stable across fluctuating environmental conditions. We found that individual sprint performances recorded at 12C were significantly repeatable after a 4wk acclimation to 22C, although relative sprint performance of fish that survived 6 mo of natural conditions in a mesocosm was not significantly repeatable.

Such environments are often characterized by low productivity, and survival depends on abilities to maintain levels of hydration sufficient for biochemical reactions and an adequate level of energy turnover. Specific adaptations for acquiring and conserving water affect the intake and utilization of energy that is available for growth and reproduction. Almost any benign, historically stable environment can become hostile if conditions change, and the severity of challenges to animals depends on temporal as well as spatial factors that are related to the intensity and duration of harsh conditions (e.g., drought). Animals have responded to such changes through avoidance, phenotypically plastic adjustments, and evolutionary changes in genomic structure. Here we present an overview of research findings presented at a session of the Third International Conference of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry. We hope such a synthesis will stimulate new directions in research that address biological responses to environmental change. In this context, we believe that challenging environments in Africa might provide increasingly useful sites for biological investigations relating to the application of comparative and evolutionary approaches toward a deeper understanding of physiological adaptation.

30160090|Boxfishes (family Ostraciidae) are tropical reefdwelling marine bony fishes that have about threefourths of their body length encased in a rigid bony test. As a result, almost all of their swimming movements derive from complex combinations of movements of their median and paired fins (MPF locomotion). In terms of both body design and swimming performance, they are among the most sophisticated examples known of naturally evolved vertebrate autonomous underwater vehicles. Quantitative studies of swimming performance, biomechanics, and energetics in one model species have shown that (i) they are surprisingly strong, fast swimmers with great endurance; (ii) classical descriptions of how they swim were incomplete: they swim at different speeds using three different gaits; (iii) they are unusually dynamically well controlled and stable during sustained and prolonged rectilinear swimming; and (iv) despite unusually high parasite (fuselage) drag, they show energetic costs of transport indistinguishable from those of much better streamlined fishes using body and caudal fin (BCF) swimming modes at similar water temperatures and over comparable ranges of swimming speeds. We summarize an analysis of these properties based on a dynamic model of swimming in these fishes. This model accounts for their control, stability, and efficiency in moving through the water at moderate speeds in terms of gait changes, of waterflow patterns over body surfaces, and of complex interactions of thrust vectors generated by fin movements.

30161152|The purpose of this symposium was to examine how foraging physiology is studied in the field across a diversity of species and habitats. While field studies are constrained by the relatively poor ability to control the experiment, the natural variability in both the environment and animal behavior provides insights into adaptation to change that are usually not tested in the laboratory. Talks in this session examined how foraging energy (both costs and gains) is partitioned over time. Time, in this case, ranged from evolutionary time (how different animals are designed to most efficiently forage), to long, lifetime periods (development of foraging ability and growth), to shortduration feeding bouts, and ultimately to the minutes to hours following ingestion (metabolic and biochemical changes). From this diversity, two core themes emerged: that foraging strategies and behaviors are limited by physiology and biochemical processes and that time plays a central role in the organization of foraging behaviors and the physiological processes that underlie those behaviors.

30161087|Physiological, anatomical, and developmental features of the crocodilian heart support the paleontological evidence that the ancestors of living crocodilians were active and endothermic, but the lineage reverted to ectothermy when it invaded the aquatic, ambush predator niche. In endotherms, there is a functional nexus between high metabolic rates, high blood flow rates, and complete separation of high systemic blood pressure from low pulmonary blood pressure in a fourchambered heart. Ectotherms generally lack all of these characteristics, but crocodilians retain a fourchambered heart. However, crocodilians have a neurally controlled, pulmonary bypass shunt that is functional in diving. Shunting occurs outside of the heart and involves the left aortic arch that originates from the right ventricle, the foramen of Panizza between the left and right aortic arches, and the cogtooth valve at the base of the pulmonary artery. Developmental studies show that all of these uniquely crocodilian features are secondarily derived, indicating a shift from the complete separation of blood flow of endotherms to the controlled shunting of ectotherms. We present other evidence for endothermy in stem archosaurs and suggest that some dinosaurs may have inherited the trait.

We tested the digestivelimitation hypothesis in yellowrumped warblers using food restriction to simulate infrequent feeding during migration, which may cause a reduction in alimentary tract mass. Restricted birds had small intestine, pancreas, and liver masses 18%22% lower than ad lib.fed controls. Total activities of sucrase, maltase, aminopeptidase, and amylase were significantly lower in restricted birds, while those of trypsin and chymotrypsin were not. Only aminopeptidase massspecific activity was significantly lower in restricted birds. Previously restricted birds were able to feed and digest at a high rate immediately following return to ad lib. feeding. Digestive efficiency did not differ between groups. These results suggest that before migration yellowrumped warblers have some spare digestive capacity to compensate for declines in their digestive organ masses during migration.

In nonhibernating mammals, these conditions typically result in severe muscle atrophy, causing a loss of strength and endurance. However, an initial study indicated that bears appeared to conserve strength while denning. We conducted an in vivo, nonsubjective measurement of strength, resistance to fatigue, and contractile properties on the tibialis anterior muscle of six hibernating bears during both early and late winter using a rigid leg brace and foot force plate. After 110 d of anorexia and confinement, skeletal muscle strength loss in hibernating bears was about onehalf that in humans confined to bed rest. Bears lost 29% of muscle strength over 110 d of denning without food, while humans on a balanced diet but confined to bed for 90 d have been reported to lose 54% of their strength. Additionally, muscle contractile properties, including contraction time, halfrelaxation time, halfmaximum value time, peak rate of development and decay, time to peak force development, and time to peak force decay did not change, indicating that no smallscale alterations in wholemuscle function occurred over the winter. This study further supports our previous findings that black bears have a high resistance to atrophy despite being subjected to longterm anorexia and limited mobility.

Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that pulmonary compliance, lung volume, and femoral lymphatic sac volume were related to terrestrialityand, hence, lymph mobilizationfor 18 species of aquatic, semiaquatic, or terrestrial anuran amphibians. Lung compliance and volume were significantly related to body mass, but there was no significant phylogenetic pattern. There were significant habitat-related patterns for mass-corrected and phylogenetically corrected residuals for these pulmonary variables. Femoral lymph volume was significantly related to body mass, with no significant phylogenetic pattern, and there was only a weak correlation for habitat with mass-corrected and phylogenetically corrected residuals. These results suggest that pulmonary volume and compliance are strongly related to terrestriality in anuran amphibians and are under significant selection pressure to enhance lymph mobilization, but lymph sac volume does not appear to have a major role in adaptation to terrestriality.

30158676|Many fishes have independently evolved beach spawning with oviposition at the waters edge. These include intertidal, subtidal, and estuarine, as well as a few freshwater, species. Their spectacular reproductive behavior at the boundary of water and land has focused attention on adults, but they emerge either briefly or not at all. The need for air breathing is more apparent in the eggs, and the reasons for emergence are more applicable to eggs than to the adults of most beachspawning fishes. There is little evidence of air breathing in the adults, unless they are regularly emerged at other times as well. Conversely, eggs metabolize in air and show substantial emergence tolerance. We consider beach spawning a form of parental care in fishes. The adults place eggs so they will be emerged into air during part or all of incubation, providing increased temperatures, oxygen availability, and protection. Beach spawning provides habitat segregation at different points in the life history, with air emergence early in the life cycle and a return to water at hatching. The parents take great risks to spawn at the waters edge to give their offspring the most advantageous beginning in life.

10.1086/656004|Technical advances that have made it possible to perform physiological measurements on very small organisms, including those in embryonic and larval stages, have resulted in the formation of the discipline of developmental physiology. The transparency and size of developing organisms in some areas permit insights into physiological processes that cannot be obtained with opaque, adult organisms. On the other hand, it is widely accepted that without eggs, there are no chickens, so physiological adaptations during early life are just as important to species survival as those manifested by adults. Physiological adaptations of early developmental stages, however, are not always the same as patterns known in adults; they often follow their own rules. The adaptability of early developmental stages demonstrates that development is not stereotyped and a phenotype is not just the result of genetic information and the expression of a certain series of genes. Environmental factors influence phenotype production, and this in turn results in flexibility and plasticity in physiological processes. This article comprises exemplary studies presented at the Fourth International Conference in Africa for Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry (Maasai Mara, Kenya, 2008). It includes a brief introduction into technical advances, discusses the developing cardiovascular system of various vertebrates, and demonstrates the flexibility and plasticity of early developmental stages. Fluid forces, oxygen availability, ionic homeostasis, and the chemical environment (including, e.g., hormone concentrations or cholesterol levels) all contribute to the shaping and performance of the cardiovascular system.

10.1086/678042|Theoretical models predict that predator-induced phenotypes should have lower fitness in the absence of predators. Tadpoles frequently respond to invertebrate predators by reducing activity levels and changing their body proportions. While some studies have shown that induced defenses in tadpoles reduce growth rates, others have found no effect. The aim of this study was to measure the effects of predator presence on energy expenditure in tadpoles. Predator exposure lowered overall metabolic rate by 19%, while specific dynamic action due to food consumption increased resting metabolism by 11%. Control tadpoles moved significantly more (93.6  3.9 cm/min) than predator-exposed animals (50.1  7.5 cm/min), and swimming increased metabolic rate by up to 400% compared to stationary tadpoles, indicating that activity can be energetically expensive and can consume as much as 37% of assimilated energy. These findings suggest that the costs of reduced foraging are context dependent and may even be beneficial in environments where high-quality resources are closely spaced but detrimental when extensive movement is required to obtain optimal resources for growth.

10.1086/679751|In zebrafish, as in most vertebrates, three different isoforms of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, Hif-1, Hif-2, and Hif-3, have been identified. The expression data of genes encoding these three proteins, as analyzed so far, show distinct expression patterns for all three isoforms during early development, under hypoxic conditions, and during exercise, suggesting differential roles for all three proteins under these different conditions. While isoform-specific functions for Hif-1 and Hif-2 have been identified in recent years, the role of Hif-3 remains somewhat elusive. Several studies mostly using mammalian cells or tissues discussed Hif-3 as a competitive inhibitor of Hif-1 and Hif-2. In zebrafish, the expression changes for Hif-1 and Hif-3 observed during development and under environmental stress conditions do not support this hypothesis, and recent studies indicate that Hif-3 is also able to directly control transcriptional activity of certain genes. The Hif signaling pathway is tightly connected to cell circuitries such as glucose and lipid metabolism, and only very recently a further linkage to the circadian clock has been described.

However, little is known regarding the endocrine mechanisms underlying bet-hedging strategies in free-ranging male vertebrates. We examined the relationships among individual energetic status, steroid hormones, mate search, and reproductive behavior in free-ranging male timber rattlesnakes. Snakes were monitored over four active seasons in order to test two hypotheses: (1) males adjust the amount of time and energy allocated toward reproduction according to the level of individual energy stores, and (2) observed condition-dependent reproductive allocation is associated with circulating concentrations of steroid hormones (testosterone and corticosterone) thought to regulate reproductive behaviors in vertebrates. A positive relationship between body condition and testosterone was observed in both the field and the laboratory. Male mate search effort was positively correlated with both body condition and testosterone. Body condition and testosterone concentrations were negatively related to time allocated toward foraging during the breeding season. A strong effect of year was observed in the analysis of testosterone and search effort, suggesting that multiple environmental factors impact hormone production and reproductive investment. Corticosterone was not related to any measured variable. Therefore, our results did not indicate a clear role of corticosterone in mediating observed relationships between energetic status and behavior. Observed relationships are consistent with the hypothesis that males allocate time and energy toward reproduction according to individual energetic status and that testosterone plays a role in mediating the trade-off between current reproductive investment and residual reproductive value.
10.1086/595589|Spitting cobras expulse venom toward the face and/or eyes of potential predators as part of their defensive repertoire. Evaluating the accuracy of the cobras is difficult because the spit venom does not land as a point but rather is distributed, in some cases widely, in complex geometric patterns on the surface of the target. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional bases of the venoms spatial distribution. Using a combination of spatial analysis of caught venom, morphology, highspeed digital videography, and electromyography (EMG), three hypothesis were evaluated. Two of these hypothesesthat the spatial distribution was due to differential venom pressure produced by the contractile activity of the adductor mandibulae externus superficiali and that the spatial distribution was produced by the morphology of the venom canal within the fangwere both rejected. The third hypothesisthat the spatial distribution was due to rapid rotational movements of the head about the vertebral columnwas supported by analyses of EMG activity within the cervical axial muscles and by predictions of venomdistribution patterns based on these cephalic displacements. These results suggest that the ability to spit venom is a unique suite of specializations involving both the axial and the cephalic systems.

In particular, different stages of the reproductive cycle may be associated with different costs and thus explain the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies.

To better understand these transitions, we aimed to specifically investigate gestation costs in a squamate reptile with a new experimental procedure. We reduced litter size during gestation in the common lizard (
10.1086/673312|Caudal autotomy is a widespread phenomenon among lizards, and similar processes occur in other groups of vertebrates and invertebrates. Many costs have been associated with autotomy, including the regeneration of lost biomass. For lizards, it is not known whether resources are preferentially directed toward caudal regeneration or whether regeneration occurs only when resources are abundant. Conflicting information is present in the literature, and an absence of controlled experiments prevents determination of what pattern of regeneration may occur under a given set of circumstances. We employed the leopard gecko, a fat-tailed species, to examine whether tail regeneration is a priority and, if so, whether it remains so when resources become limiting. We explored this through caudal autotomy and dietary manipulation under conditions that ensured that differences in diet were sufficient to permit differential growth. We examined juvenile leopard geckos because these animals are rapidly growing and allocation of energy is not compromised by reproductive investment. The effects of dietary resource availability and the demands of caudal regeneration were compared in intact and regenerating animals. Our evidence indicates that caudal regeneration is a priority, even when resources are limiting. We conclude that tail regrowth is a priority that is associated with long-term survival and possibly reproductive success.
10.1086/588177|As top predators in many oceanic communities, sharks are known to eat large prey and are supposedly able to generate high bite forces. This notion has, however, largely gone untested due to the experimental intractability of these animals. For those species that have been investigated, it remains unclear whether their high bite forces are simply a consequence of their large body size or the result of dietrelated adaptation. As aquatic poikilotherms, sharks can grow very large, making them ideal subjects with which to investigate the effects of body size on bite force. Relative biteforce capacity is often associated with changes in head shape because taller or wider heads can, for example, accommodate larger jaw muscles. Constraints on bite force in general may also be released by changes in tooth shape. For example, more pointed teeth may allow a predator to penetrate prey more effectively than blunt, pavementlike teeth. Our analyses show that large sharks do not bite hard for their body size, but they generally have larger heads. Head width is the best predictor of bite force across the species included in our study as indicated by a multiple regression model. Contrary to our predictions, sharks with relatively high bite forces for their body size also have relatively more pointed teeth at the front of the tooth row. Moreover, species including hard prey in their diet are characterized by high bite forces and narrow and pointed teeth at the jaw symphysis.

10.1086/650472|The digestive system is the interface between the supply of food for an animal and the demand for energy and nutrients to maintain the body, to grow, and to reproduce. Digestive systems are not morphologically static but rather dynamically respond to changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of the diet and the level of food intake. In this article, we discuss three themes that affect the ability of an animal to alter digestive function in relation to novel substrates and changing food supply: (1) the fermentative digestion in herbivores, (2) the integration of cardiopulmonary and digestive functions, and (3) the evolution of dietary specialization. Herbivores consume, digest, and detoxify complex diets by using a wide variety of enzymes expressed by bacteria, predominantly in the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Carnivores, such as snakes that feed intermittently, sometimes process very large meals that require compensatory adjustments in blood flow, acid secretion, and regulation of acidbase homeostasis. Snakes and birds that specialize in simple diets of prey or nectar retain their ability to digest a wider selection of prey. The digestive system continues to be of interest to comparative physiologists because of its plasticity, both phenotypic and evolutionary, and because of its widespread integration with other physiological systems, including thermoregulation, circulation, ventilation, homeostasis, immunity, and reproduction.

However, detailed analyses of how changes in locomotor activity and running behavior affect energy budgets are scarce. We quantified these effects in four replicate lines of house mice that have been selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running (S lines) and in their four nonselected control lines (C lines). We monitored wheel speeds and oxygen consumption for 2448 h to determine daily energy expenditure (DEE), resting metabolic rate (RMR), locomotor costs, and running behavior (bout characteristics). Daily running distances increased roughly 50%90% in S lines in response to selection. After we controlled for body mass effects, selection resulted in a 23% increase in DEE in males and a 6% increase in females. Total activity costs (DEE  RMR) accounted for 50%60% of DEE in both S and C lines and were 29% higher in S males and 5% higher in S females compared with their C counterparts. Energetic costs of increased daily running distances differed between sexes because S females evolved higher running distances by running faster with little change in time spent running, while S males also spent 40% more time running than C males. This increase in time spent running impinged on high energy costs because the majority of running costs stemmed from postural costs (the difference between RMR and the zerospeed intercept of the speed vs. metabolic rate relationship). No statistical differences in these traits were detected between S and C females, suggesting that large changes in locomotor behavior do not necessarily effect overall energy budgets. Running behavior also differed between sexes: within S lines, males ran with more but shorter bouts than females. Our results indicate that selection effects on energy budgets can differ dramatically between sexes and that energetic constraints in S males might partly explain the apparent selection limit for wheel running observed for over 15 generations.

Evaporative water loss and oxygen consumption rates of birds breathing normally (nasopharyngeal breathing) and with nasal turbinates experimentally bypassed (oropharyngeal breathing) were measured. Water and heat loss rates were calculated from lung tidal volumes and nasal and oropharyngeal exhaled air temperatures (
30161297|Incubation in most avian species involves transferring heat from parent to egg through a highly vascularized brood patch. Some birds, however, do not develop a brood patch. Unusual among birds, these species hold their eggs under the webs of their feet, but the role of the feet in heat transfer is uncertain. Often the webs are positioned between the feathered abdomen and the egg during incubation, suggesting that either the abdomen, the feet, or both could transfer heat to the egg. We studied heat transfer from foot webs to eggs during incubation in Nazca boobies by spatially separating the feet from the abdomen using an oversized egg. We found that feet transfer heat to eggs independently of any heat that may be transferred from the abdomen. In addition, we found that incubating boobies had significantly greater vascularization in their foot webs, measured as a percentage of web area covered by vessels, than nonincubating boobies. We also found that males, whether incubating or nonincubating, had significantly less web vascularization than females. We concluded that vascularized Nazca booby feet function in the same way during incubation that vascularized brood patches do, acting as surrogate brood patches.
10.1086/605935|Aggression is an important component of behavior in many animals and may be crucial to providing individuals with a competitive advantage when resources are limited. Although much is known about the effects of catecholamines and hormones on aggression, relatively few studies have examined the effects of physical performance on aggression. Here we use a large, sexually dimorphic teiid lizard to test whether individuals that show high levels of physical performance (bite force) are also more aggressive toward a potential threat (i.e., a human approaching the lizard). Our results show that independent of their sex, larger individuals with higher bite forces were indeed more aggressive. Moreover, our data show that individuals with higher bite forces tend to show decreased escape responses and are slower, providing evidence for a tradeoff between fight and flight abilities. As bite force increased dramatically with body size, we suggest that large body size and bite force may reduce the threshold for an individual to engage in an aggressive encounter, allowing it to potentially gain or maintain resources and fight off predators while minimizing the risk of injury.

In this study, we investigated how hydrophobicity of residue 268 affects the biochemical properties of RM-CK and M1-CK at low temperature. We generated three mutants of both RM-CK and M1-CK: Asp268, Lys268, and Leu268. The secondary structures of these mutants were similar, as revealed by their circular dichroism spectra. Similar to the Asn268 mutants, the Asp268 and Lys268 mutants of RM-CK and M1-CK exhibited higher specific activities at 10C and pH 8.0. However, no such effect was observed for the RM-CK and M1-CK Leu268 mutants. While in the presence of cryoprotectant (sucrose or trehalose), the activities of wild-type RM-CK and M1-CK mutant enzymes with a hydrophobic residue at 268 were higher, and the effect was more profound at pH 8.0. It may be inferred that water molecules affect protein conformation around residue 268, thereby influencing protein stability at low temperature.
10.1086/594381|The pharyngeal jaws of moray eels function exclusively to transport prey from the oral jaws into the esophagus. This functional innovation in the moray pharyngeal jaw system occurred through the loss of some ancestral functions that presumably included prey processing. Therefore, the oral jaws of morays are used to capture and process prey. Dietary accounts suggest that morays can be categorized as either piscivorous or durophagous in feeding habits. These extreme feeding specializations that select for conflicting biomechanical demands on the oral jaws should result in two discrete clusters of cranial form and diet in morphospace. When functional characters underlying the oral jaws were examined for 10 muraenid species, piscivorous and durophagous morays occupied distinct areas of morphospace. Piscivores exhibited longer jaws, narrower heads, and long recurved teeth, while durophagous morays exhibited shorter jaws, greater dentary depths, and short blunt teeth. Durophagous morays process prey in their oral jaws, and their jawopening and jawclosing ratios, along with their enlarged adductors, revealed jaws modified for force transmission. Pharyngeal jaw characters also separated moray species into different areas of morphospace. For example,

30158054|August Krogh counseled the careful selection of the best subject organism on which to undertake mechanistic physiological research. But what if an organism with the desired properties does not exist? It is now within our power to engineer organisms genetically to achieve novel combinations of traits. I propose that it is a logical extension of the Krogh principle that we use biological methodologies to create novel organisms ideally suited for particular physiological studies. Transgenics may first come to mind as the method for such transformations, but here I suggest that an alternative and complementary technique for generating biological novelty is experimental evolution. The latter has several advantages, including modification of multiple characters in one experiment, the production of advantageous traits, the testing of evolutionary hypotheses, and the identification of previously unsuspected factors involved in adaptation. Three experiments are reviewed, each of which examined the evolution of different physiological characters in different environments and organisms: locomotor performance in mice, desiccation tolerance in fruit flies, and high temperature adaptation in bacteria. While diverse in experimental type and subject, all resulted in the successful production of new variants with enhanced function in their new environments. Each experiment successfully tested hypotheses concerning physiological evolution, and in each case, unanticipated results emerged, which suggests previously unsuspected adaptive pathways and mechanisms. In addition, replicate populations in each experiment adjusted to their common environments by several different means, which indicates that physiological evolution may follow diverse stochastic pathways during adaptation. Experimental evolution can be a valuable method to produce and investigate new physiological variants and traits. The choice of experimental subjects, according to the Krogh principle, is no longer limited to currently existing organisms but is open to our imaginations and our ingenuity.

PBZ10050|Scorpions exhibit some of the lowest recorded water loss rates compared with those of other terrestrial arthropods of similar body size. Evaporative water loss (EWL) includes cuticular transpiration and respiratory water loss (RWL) from gas exchange surfaces, that is, book lung lamellae. Estimated fractions of cuticular and respiratory losses currently available from the literature show considerable variation, at least partly as a result of differences in methodology. This study reports RWL rates and their relative importance in scorpions from two families (Buthidae and Scorpionidae), including both xeric and mesic species (or subspecies). Two of the included Buthidae were surface-dwelling species, and another inhabits empty burrows of other terrestrial arthropods. This experimental design enabled correlating RWL importance with scorpion phylogeny, habitat type, and/or homing behavior. Buthidae species exhibited significantly lower EWL rates compared with those of Scorpionidae, whereas effects of habitat type and homing behavior were not significant. Resting RWL rates were not significantly affected by scorpion phylogeny, but rates for the xeric species (totaling 10% of EWL rates at 30C) were significantly lower compared with those of mesic species. These lower RWL values were correlated with significantly lower H
10.1086/673092|Hibernating mammals become sequestered and cease foraging during prolonged seasonal periods of reduced or unpredictable food availability and instead rely on cached food and/or endogenous reserves of fat and protein accumulated during the previous active season. The gain in weight is due to increased food consumption, but it also has been hypothesized that hibernators maximize rates of fattening by decreasing costs of maintenance before weight gain, reflected in reduced resting metabolic rate (RMR). We recorded repeated measures of total body, lean, and fat mass in individual adult male and female arctic ground squirrels across their active season and found that squirrels increased body mass by 42% (males) and 62% (females). This gain was achieved through a 17% increase in lean mass and a 78-fold increase in fat mass; however, mass gain was not linear and patterns differed between sexes. Contrary to our hypothesis, decreases in RMR were not associated with rapid mass gain. We found RMR of males increased (whole-animal RMR or lean-mass-specific RMR) or remained constant (mass-specific RMR) for most of the active season and decreased only after the majority of mass had been gained. In females, although RMR (whole-animal, mass-specific, and lean-mass RMR) generally decreased across the active season, the greatest decrease occurred late in the active season after the majority of mass had been gained. In conclusion, arctic ground squirrels do not trade off metabolism to facilitate rates of weight gain before hibernation, but they do use energy sparing strategies before hibernation that help maintain peak mass.

However, the placenta also may permit diffusion of lipidsoluble steroid hormones that influence processes such as sexspecific fetal development and maternal pregnancy maintenance.

Such mechanisms may be less highly developed in species that have recently evolved placentation, such as many reptiles. We therefore chose to investigate placental metabolism of steroids in the viviparous lizard
10.1086/589950|Extremely specialized and long tongues used for prey capture have evolved independently in plethodontid salamanders and chameleons. In both systems, the demands on tongue projection are probably similar: to maximize projection velocity and distance. Consequently, many of the design features of the projection system in these two groups have converged to an astonishing degree. Both involve the use of power amplification systems based on helically wound muscle fibers that load internal connective tissue sheets as illustrated in previous studies. Demands imposed on tongue retraction, however, are different to some degree. Although in both groups there is a clear demand for retraction capacity (given the long projection distances), in chameleons there is an added demand for force because they eat large and heavy prey. As indicated by our data, plethodontid salamanders have extremely long tongue retractors with normal striated muscle. Chameleons, on the other hand, evolved long retractors of the supercontracting type. Interestingly, our data show that at least in chameleons, the extreme design of the tongue in function of prey capture appears to have consequences on prey transport, resulting in an increased dependence on the hyoid. In turn, this has lead to an increase in transportcycle duration and an increase in the number of cycles needed to transport prey in comparison with closely related agamid lizards. Clearly, extreme morphological specializations are tuned to functional and ecological demands and may induce a reduced performance in other functions performed by the same set of integrated structures.

10.1086/666970|The study of phenotypic evolution should be an integrative endeavor that combines different approaches and crosses disciplinary and phylogenetic boundaries to consider complex traits and organisms that historically have been studied in isolation from each other. Analyses of individual variation within populations can act to bridge studies focused at the levels of morphology, physiology, biochemistry, organismal performance, behavior, and life history. For example, the study of individual variation recently facilitated the integration of behavior into the concept of a pace-of-life syndrome and effectively linked the field of energetics with research on animal personality. Here, we illustrate how studies on the pace-of-life syndrome and the energetics of personality can be integrated within a physiology-performance-behavior-fitness paradigm that includes consideration of ecological context. We first introduce key concepts and definitions and then review the rapidly expanding literature on the links between energy metabolism and personality traits commonly studied in nonhuman animals (activity, exploration, boldness, aggressiveness, sociability). We highlight some empirical literature involving mammals and squamates that demonstrates how emerging fields can develop in rather disparate ways because of historical accidents and/or particularities of different kinds of organisms. We then briefly discuss potentially interesting avenues for future conceptual and empirical research in relation to motivation, intraindividual variation, and mechanisms underlying trait correlations. The integration of performance traits within the pace-of-life-syndrome concept has the potential to fill a logical gap between the context dependency of selection and how energetics and personality are expected to interrelate. Studies of how performance abilities and/or aspects of Darwinian fitness relate to both metabolic rate and personality traits are particularly lacking.

Although ammonia is toxic, because it is highly water soluble its excretion may be facilitated in animals that ingest and excrete large amounts of water. Birdpollinated plants secrete carbohydrate and waterrich floral nectars that contain exceedingly little protein. Thus, nectarfeeding birds are faced with the dual challenge of meeting nitrogen requirements while disposing of large amounts of water. The peculiar diet of nectarfeeding birds suggests two hypotheses: (1) these birds must have low protein requirements, and (2) when they ingest large quantities of water their primary nitrogen excretion product may be ammonia. To test these hypotheses, we measured maintenance nitrogen requirements (MNR) and total endogenous nitrogen losses (TENL) in three hummingbird species (

Metabolic cold adaptation (MCA) predicts that populations or species from cooler environments will have either a higher metabolic rate at a common temperature or steeper MRT relationships, indicating greater sensitivity of respiratory metabolism to temperature. Support for MCA has been found in some insect species by comparing species or populations differing in latitude. However, the generality of these findings are contentious, with most studies either unable to account for phenotypic plasticity or the evolutionary relatedness of species or populations. Hence, the importance of MCA is vigorously debated from both evolutionary and ecological perspectives.

30158674|The airbreathing fishes have heuristic importance as possible models for the Paleozoic evolution of vertebrate air breathing and the transition to land. A recent hypothesis about this transition suggests that the diverse assemblage of marine amphibious fishes occurring primarily in tropical, high intertidal zone habitats are analogs of early tetrapods and that the intertidal zone, not tropical freshwater lowlands, was the springboard habitat for the Devonian land transition by vertebrates. Here we argue that selection pressures imposed by life in the intertidal zone are insufficient to have resulted in the requisite aerial respiratory capacity or the degree of separation from water required for the vertebrate land transition. The extant marine amphibious fishes, which occur mainly on rocky shores or mudflats, have reached the limit of their niche expansion onto land and remain tied to water by respiratory structures that are less efficient in air and more vulnerable to desiccation than lungs. We further argue that evolutionary contingencies actuated by the Devonian origin of the tetrapods marked a critical point of divergence for a way of life in which selection pressures would operate on the physiology, morphology, and natural history of the different vertebrate groups. While chronically hypoxic and shallow water conditions in the habitats of some primitive bony fishes and some amphibians appear similar to the conditions that prevailed in the Devonian, markedly different selection pressures have operated on other amphibians and bony fishes over the 300 million years since the vertebrate land transition. For example, both egg development and larval metamorphosis in extant amphibians are geared mainly toward compensating for the uncertainty of habitat water quality or even the absence of water by minimizing the time required to develop there. In contrast, reproduction by most intertidal (and amphibious) fishes, all of which are teleosts, remains dependent on a planktonic larval phase and is characterized by specializations (brooding) that minimize overdispersal and maximize recruitment back to the littoral habitat.

30158407|Exercise increases metabolic rate and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also elevates protein turnover. ROS cause damage to macromolecules (e.g., proteins) and thereby contribute to aging. Protein turnover removes and replaces damaged proteins. The balance between these two responses may underlie beneficial effects of physical activity on aging. Effects of lifelong exercise on antioxidant enzyme activities and fractional synthesis rate of protein (FSRP) were examined at various ages (226 mo) in heart, liver, and muscle of mice that had been selectively bred for high wheelrunning activity, housed with (S+) or without (S) a running wheel, and their randombred controls (C+) housed with running wheels. FSRP decreased with age and increased in muscle of young, but not old, activityselected mice. Enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase decreased with age and showed a peak at 10 mo of age in liver. Selection for wheelrunning activity did not affect antioxidant enzyme activity. Daily energy expenditure correlated positively with antioxidant levels in liver. This might indicate that oxidative stress (ROS production) increases with metabolic rate, driving upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Alternatively, the elevated energy expenditure may reflect the energetic cost of elevated protection, consistent with the disposablesoma hypothesis and with other studies showing positive links between energy expenditure and life span. Longterm elevations in voluntary exercise did not result in elevations in antioxidant enzyme activities or protein synthesis rates.

10.1086/683039|Endothermy, high basal metabolic rates (BMRs), and high locomotor-related metabolism were important steps in the evolution of mammals. It has been proposed that the composition of membrane phospholipid fatty acids plays an important role in energy metabolism and exercise muscle physiology. In particular, the membrane pacemaker theory of metabolism suggests that an increase in cell membrane fatty acid unsaturation would result in an increase in BMR. We aimed to determine whether membrane phospholipid fatty acid composition of heart, liver, and gastrocnemius muscles differed between lines of bank voles selected for high swim-induced aerobic metabolismwhich also evolved an increased BMRand unselected control lines. Proportions of fatty acids significantly differed among the organs: liver was the least unsaturated, whereas the gastrocnemius muscles were most unsaturated. However, fatty acid proportions of the heart and liver did not differ significantly between selected and control lines. In gastrocnemius muscles, significant differences between selection directions were found: compared to control lines, membranes of selected voles were richer in saturated C18:0 and unsaturated C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3, whereas the pattern was reversed for saturated C16:0 and unsaturated C20:4n-6. Neither unsaturation index nor other combined indexes of fatty acid proportions differed between lines. Thus, our results do not support the membrane pacemaker hypothesis. However, the differences between selected and control lines in gastrocnemius muscles reflect chain lengths rather than number of double bonds and are probably related to differences in locomotor activity per se rather than to differences in the basal or routine metabolic rate.

30161328|Vertebrate hearts from fish to mammals secrete peptide hormones with profound natriuretic, diuretic, and vasodilatory activity; however, the specific role of these cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) in homeostasis is unclear. NPs have been suggested to be involved in salt excretion in saltwater teleosts, whereas they are proposed to be more important in volume regulation in mammals. In this review, we consider an alternative (or perhaps complementary) function of NPs to protect the heart. This hypothesis is based on a number of observations. First, evidence for NPs, or NPlike activity has been found in all vertebrate hearts thus far examined, from osmoconforming saltwater hagfish to euryhaline freshwater and saltwater teleosts to terrestrial mammals. Thus the presence of cardiac NPs appears to be independent of environmental conditions that may variously affect salt and water balance. Second, cardiac stretch is a universal, and one of the most powerful, NP secretagogues. Furthermore, stretchinduced NP release in euryhaline teleosts appears relatively independent of ambient salinity. Third, excessive cardiac stretch that increases enddiastolic volume (EDV) can compromise the mechanical ability of the heart by decreasing actinmyosin interaction (lengthtension) or through Laplace effects whereby as EDV increases, the wall tension necessary to maintain a constant pressure must also increase. Excessive cardiac stretch can be produced by factors that decrease cardiac emptying (i.e., increased arterial pressure), or by factors that increase cardiac filling (i.e., increased blood volume, increased venous tone, or decreased venous compliance). Fourth, the major physiological actions of cardiac NPs enhance cardiac emptying and decrease cardiac filling. In fish, NPs promote cardiac emptying by decreasing gill vascular resistance, thereby lowering ventral aortic pressure. In mammals a similar effect is achieved through pulmonary vasodilation. NPs also decrease cardiac filling by decreasing blood volume and increasing venous compliance, the latter producing a rapid fall in central venous pressure. Fifth, the presence of NP clearance receptors in the gill and lung (between the heart and systemic circulation) suggest that these tissues may be exposed to considerably higher NP titers than are systemic tissues. Thus, a decrease in outflow resistance immediately downstream from the heart may be the first response to increased cardiac distension. Because the physiology of cardiac NPs is basically the same in fish and mammals, we propose that the cardioprotective effects of NPs have been well preserved throughout the course of vertebrate evolution. It is also likely that the cardioprotective role of NPs was one of the most primordial homeostatic activities of these peptides in the earliest vertebrates.

Previous studies in juvenile phocid seals suggest that increases in physiological dive capacity during the postweaning fast (PWF) are critical to support independent aquatic foraging. Although there is a strong relationship between size at weaning and PWF duration and body reserves at weaning vary considerably, few studies have considered whether such variation in body reserve magnitude promotes phenotypic modulation of dive capacity development during the PWF. Phenotypic modulation, a form of developmental plasticity in which rates and degrees of expression of the developmental program are modulated by environmental factors, may enhance diving capacity in weanlings with reduced PWF durations due to smaller body reserves at weaning if reduced body reserves promote accelerated development of dive capacity. We longitudinally measured changes in blood and muscle oxygen stores and muscle metabolic enzymes over the first 8 wk of the PWF in northern elephant seals and determined whether rates of change in these parameters varied with body reserves at weaning. We assessed whether erythropoietin (EPO), thyroid hormones, serum nonesterified fatty acid levels, and iron status influenced blood and muscle oxygen store development or were influenced by body reserves at weaning. Although mass-specific plasma volume and blood volume were relatively stable across the fast, both were elevated in animals with reduced body reserves. Surprisingly, hemoglobin and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations declined over the PWF while hematocrit remained stable, and these variables were not associated with body reserves or EPO. Swimming muscle myoglobin and serum iron levels increased rapidly early in the PWF and were not related to body reserves. Patterns in maximal activities of muscle enzymes suggested a decline in total aerobic and anaerobic metabolic capacity over the PWF, despite maintenance of fat oxidation capacity. These results suggest that only development of blood volume is increased in smaller weanlings and that extended fasting durations in larger weanlings do not improve physiological dive capacity.

Despite maintaining similar relative limb loads during ontogeny, bone strain magnitudes in the goat radius and emu tibiotarsus generally increased. However, while the strain increases in the emu tibiotarsus were mostly insignificant, strains within the radii of adult goats were two to four times greater than in young goats. The disparity between ontogenetic strain increases in these taxa resulted from differences in ontogenetic scaling patterns of the crosssectional bone geometry. While the crosssectional and second moments of area scaled with negative allometry in the goat radius, these measures were not significantly different from isometry in the emu tibiotarsus. Although the juveniles of both taxa exhibited lower strains and higher safety factors than the adults, the radii of the young goats were more robust relative to the adult goats than were the tibiotarsi of the young compared with adult emu. Differences in ontogenetic growth and strain patterns in the limb bones examined likely result from different threat avoidance strategies and selection pressures in the juveniles of these two taxa.

10.1086/649964|Converting food to chemical energy (ATP) that is usable by cells is a principal requirement to sustain life. The rate of ATP production has to be sufficient for housekeeping functions, such as protein synthesis and maintaining membrane potentials, as well as for growth and locomotion. Energy metabolism is temperature sensitive, and animals respond to environmental variability at different temporal levels, from withinindividual to evolutionary timescales. Here we review principal molecular mechanisms that underlie control of oxidative ATP production in response to climate variability. Nuclear transcription factors and coactivators control expression of mitochondrial proteins and abundance of mitochondria. Fatty acid and phospholipid concentrations of membranes influence the activity of membranebound proteins as well as the passive leak of protons across the mitochondrial membrane. Passive proton leak as well as proteinmediated proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane determine the efficacy of ATP production but are also instrumental in endothermic heat production and as a defense against reactive oxygen species. Both transcriptional mechanisms and membrane composition interact with environmental temperature and diet, and this interaction between diet and temperature in determining mitochondrial function links the two major environmental variables that are affected by changing climates. The limits to metabolic plasticity could be set by the production of reactive oxygen species leading to cellular damage, limits to substrate availability in mitochondria, and a disproportionally large increase in proton leak over ATP production.

30161028|Many fruits contain high levels of available energy but very low levels of protein and other nutrients. The discrepancy between available energy and protein creates a physiological paradox for many animals consuming highfruit diets, as they will be protein deficient if they eat to meet their minimum energy requirement. We fed young grizzly bears both highenergy pelleted and fruit diets containing from 1.6% to 15.4% protein to examine the role of dietinduced thermogenesis and fat synthesis in dealing with highenergylowprotein diets. Digestible energy intake at mass maintenance increased 2.1 times, and composition of the gain changed from primarily lean mass to entirely fat when the protein content of the diet decreased from 15.4% to 1.6%. Daily fat gain was up to three times higher in bears fed lowprotein diets ad lib., compared with bears consuming the higherprotein diet and gaining mass at the same rate. Thus, bears eating fruit can either consume other foods to increase dietary protein content and reduce energy expenditure, intake, and potentially foraging time or overeat highfruit diets and use dietinduced thermogenesis and fat synthesis to deal with their skewed energytoprotein ratio. These are not discrete options but a continuum that creates numerous solutions for balancing energy expenditure, intake, foraging time, fat accumulation, and ultimately fitness, depending on food availability, foraging efficiency, bear size, and body condition.

In contrast, in species with low rates of agonistic interactions or when social relationships are stable, testosterone levels should not correlate with social status. The challenge hypothesis predicts that androgen levels should rise during periods of courtship or mate guarding. We addressed these questions in freeranging spotted hyenas, a species with low rates and low intensities of aggression among males but where males spend extensive effort to court females. In males, we measured testosterone, its precursor androstenedione, and its metabolite 5dihydrotestosterone. As predicted, testosterone levels were significantly higher and androstenedione levels tended to be higher in males that, at the time of sampling, defended a female, compared with males that did not defend a female. Also, as predicted, there was no correlation between social status and androgen levels in male spotted hyenas.

It was also important in defining the allometric relationship between body mass and metabolic rate of mammals. The BMR of mammals varies with body mass, with the same allometric exponent as field metabolic rate and with many physiological and biochemical rates. The membrane pacemaker theory proposes that the fatty acid composition of membrane bilayers is an important determinant of a species BMR. In both mammals and birds, membrane polyunsaturation decreases and monounsaturation increases with increasing body mass and a decrease in massspecific BMR. The secretion and production of thyroid hormones in mammals are related to body mass, with the allometric exponent similar to BMR; yet there is no body sizerelated variation in either total or free concentrations of thyroid hormones in plasma of mammals. It is suggested that in differentsized mammals, the secretion/production of thyroid hormones is a result of BMR differences rather than their cause. BMR is a useful concept in some situations but not in others.

Additionally, high water absorption capacity was predicted to be associated with high paracellular nutrient absorption due to solvent drag. We compared the water absorption rates of sanguivorous, nectarivorous, frugivorous, and insectivorous bats in intestinal luminal perfusions. High water absorption rates were associated with high expected dietary water load but were not highly correlated with previously measured rates of (paracellular) arabinose clearance. In conjunction with these tests, we measured water absorption and the paracellular absorption of nutrients in the intestine and stomach of vampire bats using luminal perfusions to test the hypothesis that the unique elongated vampire stomach is a critical site of water absorption. Vampire bats gastric water absorption was high compared to mice but not compared to their intestines. We therefore conclude that (1) dietary water content has influenced the evolution of intestinal water absorption capacity in bats, (2) solvent drag is not the only driver of paracellular nutrient absorption, and (3) the vampire stomach is a capable but not critical location for water absorption.

30161105|Plasma metabolite profiling offers a potential means to assess stopover refueling performance of migratory birds from a single capture. However, this method has not previously been validated where site quality has been determined independently using analysis of capture data. We captured and blood sampled six passerine bird species refueling at known highquality (BASE) and lowquality (TIP) sites at Long Point, Ontario, Canada. Plasma triglyceride, an indicator of fat deposition, was higher at the BASE in three earlyseason species: the hermit thrush, the American robin, and the whitethroated sparrow. Plasma BOHbutyrate, an indicator of fasting and lipid utilization, was lower at the BASE in the same three species. Plasma glycerol was lower at the BASE in American robins, and plasma phospholipid did not differ between sites. No metabolite suggested better conditions at the TIP in any species. Regression of sizecorrected mass on time of day also indicated better refueling performance at the BASE in some species, but metabolite profiling was generally more sensitive to site differences. The relationship between plasma glycerol and triglyceride was Ushaped, indicating high glycerol production during both lipolysis (as was previously known) and rapid fat deposition. Our results confirm the validity of metabolite profiling to assess stopover habitat quality and individual performance in refueling migrants.
30161078|The locomotor performance (absolute maximum running speed [MRS]) of 120 mammals was analyzed for four different locomotor modes (plantigrade, digitigrade, unguligrade, and lagomorphlike) in terms of body size and basal metabolic rate (BMR). Analyses of conventional species data showed that the MRS of plantigrade and digitigrade mammals and lagomorphs increases with body mass, whereas that of unguligrade mammals decreases with body mass. These trends were confirmed in plantigrade mammals and lagomorphs using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Multiple regression analyses of MRS contrasts (dependent variable) as a function of body mass and BMR contrasts (predictor variables) revealed that BMR was a significant predictor of MRS in the complete data set, as well as in plantigrade and nonplantigrade mammals. However, there was severe multicollinearity in the nonplantigrade model that may influence the interpretation of these models. Although these data show massindependent correlation between BMR and MRS, they are not necessarily indicative of a causeeffect relationship. However, the analyses do identify a negligible role of body size associated with MRS once phylogenetic and BMR effects are controlled, suggesting that the body size increase in large mammals over time (i.e., Copes rule) can probably rule out MRS as a driving variable.

30161151|Both technological and conceptual advances continue to enhance our ability to evaluate physiological mechanisms in freeliving animals. Although complex and uncontrolled natural environments may challenge our ability to define causal mechanistic relationships, they provide opportunities not available in more conventional laboratory settings. Among these opportunities are the ability to observe the interplay between physiology and behavior, the potential inspiration to physiological studies from novel observations in the field, and the ability to evaluate the extent to which particular physiological systems are challenged under natural conditions. As we accumulate information about physiological function in the field, we are often forced to reconsider established paradigms: hibernating bears may contract their muscles to maintain strength and tone, testosterone levels in male stonechats maintaining territories in winter are exceptionally low, wintering emperor penguins may risk overheating, and large desert mammals may eschew braincooling mechanisms. Measuring and quantifying the organismal response to a changing environment provides a link between mechanistic physiology and behavior, ecology, and evolution and gives us new tools to understand population, community, and ecosystemlevel processes.
30161150|Evolutionary physiology is the emerging physiological discipline. Unlike environmental physiology or ecophysiology, whose definitions have long been made quite clear, evolutionary physiology has a broader scope of objectives, and its definition lacks a concise treatise. This paper presents the argument that the lack of a common definition of evolutionary physiology is retarding the unification of the mechanistic and amechanistic physiological sciences, a multidisciplinary obligation crucial for a holistic understanding of a physiological basis of fitness. The divide between mechanistic how questions, devoted primarily to homeostasis, and evolutionary why questions, concerned with understanding phenotypic and genotypic physiological variation, remains broad and is currently not conducive to synergy in the physiological disciplines. Unification may be facilitated, however, by embracing a common currency of measurement and analysis. A likely candidate is the cascade of energy from the environment to offspring and the evolution of physiological form and function, including homeostasis, associated with power management. This currency approach seeks to identify an energetic basis of fitness, namely, whether or how the evolution of lifehistory traits is influenced by energetic constraints and/or tradeoffs.

Newer paleobiological approaches have also contributed to changed views of which animals were involved and when, where, and how the transition occurred. This review summarizes major advances made and reevaluates alternative interpretations of important parts of the evidence. We begin with general issues and concepts, including limitations of the Paleozoic fossil record. We summarize important features of paleoclimates, paleoenvironments, paleobiogeography, and taphonomy. We then review the history of Devonian tetrapods and their closest stem group ancestors within the sarcopterygian fishes. It is now widely accepted that the first tetrapods arose from advanced tetrapodomorph stock (the elpistostegalids) in the Late Devonian, probably in Euramerica. However, truly terrestrial forms did not emerge until much later, in geographically farflung regions, in the Lower Carboniferous. The complete transition occurred over about 25 million years; definitive emergences onto land took place during the most recent 5 million years. The sequence of character acquisition during the transition can be seen as a fivestep process involving: (1) higher osteichthyan (tetrapodomorph) diversification in the Middle Devonian (beginning about 380 million years ago [mya]), (2) the emergence of prototetrapods (e.g.,
30158079|Previous studies have shown that wholeanimal thermal responses of ectotherms and heterotherms (e.g., hibernators), both of which experience a wide range of body temperatures, are related to the saturation level of somatic lipids, which in turn can be influenced by the ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the diet. This study demonstrates that Djungarian hamsters held in long days display ambient temperaturedependent choice of dietary fats, increasing their preference for saturated fats when ambient temperature increases (to 27C) and later reversing this preference when ambient temperature is returned to its original value (8C). Changes in percent contribution of the unsaturated and saturated diets in response to temperature were accomplished almost solely by changes in the amount of unsaturated diet consumed. Temperaturedependent fatty acid choice occurs at a stage in the annual cycle when Djungarian hamsters do not enter spontaneous daily torpor and therefore experience only small changes in core body temperature. These results suggest that temperaturedependent fatty acid choice may occur in a wide range of animals, including nonheterothermic endotherms.

10.1086/649966|Bile salts are the major end metabolites of cholesterol and are also important in lipid and protein digestion, as well as shaping of the gut microflora. Previous studies had demonstrated variation of bile salt structures across vertebrate species. We greatly extend prior surveys of bile salt variation in fish and amphibians, particularly in analysis of the biliary bile salts of Agnatha and Chondrichthyes. While there is significant structural variation of bile salts across all fish orders, bile salt profiles are generally stable within orders of fish and do not correlate with differences in diet. This large data set allowed us to infer evolutionary changes in the bile salt synthetic pathway. The hypothesized ancestral bile salt synthetic pathway, likely exemplified in extant hagfish, is simpler and much shorter than the pathway of most teleost fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Thus, the bile salt synthetic pathway has become longer and more complex throughout vertebrate evolution. Analysis of the evolution of bile salt synthetic pathways provides a rich model system for the molecular evolution of a complex biochemical pathway in vertebrates.

For both species, incubation of arches at the higher temperature led to 1.5 to 3fold greater measures of water weight gain. However, gills from warmeracclimated trout and tilapia had 1 to >3fold lower the initial rate and 1.5 to >2.5fold lower the extent of water uptake seen in colderacclimated conspecifics. Both the incubation temperature sensitivity and the acclimation effects are consistent with transmembrane water permeation. Calciumfree incubations (permitting paracellular water movement) also indicated that interfacial cell membranes contribute to gill permeability characteristics; without calcium, trout gill osmotic water uptake values increased 1.5 to 2fold, and the temperature dependence of water uptake decreased (initial rate) or was eliminated (extent). The specific contribution of cholesterol to restricting barrier membrane water permeability was indicated by concentrationdependent increases in water uptake in the presence of either nystatin (a cholesterolcomplexing, poreforming agent) or methylcyclodextrin (which selectively depletes membrane cholesterol). In addition, a cholesterolspecific cytochemical probe (filipin) intensely labeled the apical surface membranes of trout and tilapia gill epithelium. In summary, these studies implicate membrane cholesterol in determining water permeability in fish gills.

30160061|During northward migration, blackcaps arrive at stopover sites in Israel's Negev Desert with reduced masses of organs that are important in food digestion and assimilation. Blackcaps that stay to refuel (largely on fruits) do not gain mass rapidly until after 3 d at the stopover site. We hypothesized that (1) it may take several days to rebuild these reduced organs, (2) during this recovery interval high feeding rates might not be possible, and (3) this could be the basis for the absence of immediate body mass gain in blackcaps at stopover sites. To test predictions from this hypothesis we used an established fasting protocol to create a group of blackcaps with reduced intestinal and liver mass compared with ad lib. fed controls. Migrants were captured and caged in the laboratory, where they were habituated to a fruit mash diet for 8 d. One experimental group was then fasted 2 d, one was fed at a restricted level (onethird ad lib. food intake) for 4 d, and one was held as ad lib.fed controls. The fasted and restricted birds were then allowed to feed again ad lib. Birds that were experimentally fasted progressively increased their daily assimilation rate and achieved the highest rate (onethird higher than controls) 3 d after the end of their fast. Birds that were restricted achieved high rates immediately once ad lib. food was provided. Increased assimilation rate was achieved via hyperphagia and not increased assimilation efficiency. The response of the fasted birds supports the hypothesis that there may be physiological constraints to the rate of refueling during migratory stopover.

All are large, active, pelagic species with high energy demands that undertake longdistance migrations and move vertically within the water column, thereby encountering a range of water temperatures. After summarizing the occurrence of endothermy among fishes, the evidence for two hypothesized advantages of endothermy in fishes, thermal niche expansion and enhancement of aerobic swimming performance, is analyzed using phylogenetic comparisons between endothermic fishes and their ectothermic relatives. Thermal niche expansion is supported by mapping endothermic characters onto phylogenies and by combining information about the thermal niche of extant species, the fossil record, and paleoceanographic conditions during the time that endothermic fishes radiated. However, it is difficult to show that endothermy was required for niche expansion, and adaptations other than endothermy are necessary for repeated diving below the thermocline. Although the convergent evolution of the ability to elevate slowtwitch, oxidative locomotor muscle temperatures suggests a selective advantage for that trait, comparisons of tunas and their ectothermic sister species (mackerels and bonitos) provide no direct support of the hypothesis that endothermy results in increased aerobic swimming speeds, slowoxidative muscle power, or energetic efficiency. Endothermy is associated with higher standard metabolic rates, which may result from high aerobic capacities required by these highperformance fishes to conduct many aerobic activities simultaneously. A high standard metabolic rate indicates that the benefits of endothermy may be offset by significant energetic costs.

30158000|Populations of scavenging seabird species in the North Sea may fluctuate with an artificial food source: the availability of fishery waste. To document this impact, it is necessary to assess the birds' nutritional status during periods with decreased fishing activity. Reference data for this purpose was collected from 22 herring gulls investigated during laboratory fasting. After 6 d of food deprivation and body mass losses exceeding 15%, the first birds entered starvation phase 3. Comparatively, this is a rather weak fasting capacity. Plasma levels of total protein and thyroid hormones decreased and hydroxybutyrate increased with fasting duration. The leucocyte proportions were shifted from lymphocytes to heterophils. After 3 d of refeeding, most of the fasting changes were reversed. Plasma enzyme activities increased and hematocrit, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte numbers decreased in both fasting and control birds, most likely as a result of experimental stress and repeated blood sampling. Glucose, cholesterol, monocytes, basophils, and glycosylated hemoglobin remained fairly constant. Triglycerides, free fatty acids, uric acid, and urea varied significantly, but changes were not as clearly a result of fasting. Therefore, total protein, hydroxybutyrate, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and lymphocyte and heterophil percentages may be the most reliable indicators of the nutritional status and the condition of freeliving herring gulls.

Traditionally, the phenotypic changes are studied by determining organ mass of snakes killed at different times during digestion. Here we evaluate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for in vivo measurements of the visceral organs in fasting and digesting snakes. Twelve snakes were MRI scanned immediately before the organs were removed and weighed to provide direct comparison of the two methods. Both methods provided similar estimates for the mass of liver, gallbladder, and pancreas, whereas MRI overestimated the size of the heart and small intestine, probably because blood and digesta contributed to the volume determined by MRI. The correlations were used to derive wet organ mass from MRI-based volumes to evaluate the mass development through repeated MRI scans of five digesting snakes. MRI was performed at fasting and 24, 48, 72, 132, and 500 h after eating a meal corresponding to 25% of body mass. This observation period revealed a reversible volume upregulation of the visceral organs, supporting the view that successive MRI facilitates in vivo investigations of structural changes accompanied by digestion.
10.1086/666606|The synthesis of melanins, which are the most common animal pigments, is influenced by glutathione (GSH), a key intracellular antioxidant. At high GSH levels, pheomelanin (the lightest melanin form) is produced, whereas production of eumelanin (the darkest melanin form) does not require GSH. Oxidative damage typically increases with age, and age-related decreases in GSH have accordingly been found in diverse organisms. Therefore, there should be positive associations between the capacity to produce eumelanic traits, GSH levels, and senescence, whereas there should be negative associations between the capacity to produce pheomelanic traits, GSH levels, and senescence.

Several factors can influence the release of the tail, such as the size, sex, and age of the lizard; type of predator; ecology; and evolutionary history of the lineage. Once lost, the tail will writhe for seconds to minutes, and these movements likely depend on the size and physiology of the tail, habitat of the lizard, and predation pressure. Loss of the tail will, in turn, have impacts on the lizard, such as modified locomotor performance and mechanics, as well as escape behavior. However, the tail is almost always regenerated, and this involves wound healing, altered investment of resources, and tissue differentiation. The regenerated tail generally differs from the original in several ways, including size, shape, and function. Here we summarize recent findings of research pertaining to tail autotomy, and we propose a framework for future investigations.

The power of these new technologies and their potential application for physiological and ecophysiological research are illustrated with examples of recent advances in key fields. These include hypoxia/anoxiaresponsive gene expression, the actions and regulation of the hypoxiainducible transcription factor, the central role of the AMPdependent kinase in mediating cellular responses to changing energy status, mammalian target of rapamycin mediation of nutrient signals in the control of protein synthesis and growth, proteomics approaches to identifying the physiological substrates of protein kinases, and the interactions of biochemistry and physiology in determining a net organismal response to high hematocrit values stimulated by erythropoietin. In particular, gene and proteinscreening technologies will drive a fundamental shift in the way that environmental stress effects on metabolism are evaluated by providing a holistic overview of the responses of a huge range of cell functions to stress and allowing researchers to identify multiple new areas of metabolic response that contribute to biochemical and physiological adaptation.

10.1086/679628|Although adult fish excrete their nitrogenous waste primarily as ammonia, larval fish may excrete a higher proportion as urea, an evolutionary strategy that lessens nitrogenous waste toxicity during early development. Previous studies firmly established that ammonia excretion is inhibited in adult fish acutely exposed to alkaline water. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that total nitrogen excretion is maintained in larval zebrafish raised in alkaline water (pH  10.0) as a result of compensatory adjustments to urea and/or ammonia transport pathways. Raising zebrafish in alkaline water from 0 to 4 d postfertilization (dpf) reduced ammonia excretion at 4 dpf, whereas urea excretion was elevated by 141%. The increase in urea excretion at 4 dpf served to maintain total nitrogen excretion constant, despite the persistent inhibition of ammonia excretion. Whole body ammonia and urea contents were not significantly altered by exposure to alkaline water. Protein and mRNA expression of Rhcg1, an apically expressed ammonia-conducting channel, were significantly elevated after 4-d exposure to alkaline water, whereas the mRNA expression of Rhag, Rhbg, and urea transporter were unaffected. The acute exposure to alkaline water of 4-dpf larvae reared in control water caused a rapid inhibition of ammonia excretion that had partially recovered within 6 h of continued exposure. The partial recovery of ammonia excretion despite continued exposure to alkaline water suggested an increased ammonia excretion capacity. In agreement with an increased capacity to excrete ammonia, the transfer of larvae back to the control (normal pH) water was accompanied by increased rates of ammonia excretion. Urea excretion was not stimulated during 6-h exposure to alkaline water. Following both chronic and acute exposure to alkaline water, the rate of uptake of methylamine (an ammonia analog) was significantly elevated, consistent with increased protein expression of the apical ammonia channel, Rhcg1. Taken together, this study demonstrates a complex interplay between ammonia and urea excretion in larval zebrafish exposed to alkaline water.

30160096|Two wingbeat gaits, distinguished by the presence or absence of lift production during the upstroke, are currently used to describe avian flight. Vortexvisualization studies indicate that lift is produced only during the downstroke in the vortexring gait and that lift is produced continuously in the continuousvortex gait. Tipreversal and feathered upstrokes represent different forms of vortexring gait distinguished by wing kinematics. Useful aerodynamic forces may be produced during tipreversal upstroke in slow flight and during a feathered upstroke in fast flight, but it is probable that downstroke forces are much greater in magnitude. Uncertainty about the function of these types of upstroke may be resolved when more data are available on wake structure in different flight speeds and modes. Inferring from wing kinematics and available data on wake structure, birds with long wings or wings of high aspect ratio use a vortexring gait with tipreversal upstroke at slow speeds, a vortexring gait with a feathered upstroke at intermediate speeds, and a continuousvortex gait at fast speeds. Birds with short wings or wings of low aspect ratio use a vortexring gait with a feathered upstroke at all speeds. Regardless of wing shape, species tend to use a vortexring gait for acceleration and a continuousvortex gait for deceleration. Some correlations may exist between gait selection and the function of the muscular and respiratory system. However, overall variation in wing kinematics, muscle activity, and respiratory activity is continuous rather than categorical. To further our understanding of gait selection in flying birds, it is important to test whether upstroke function varies in a similar manner. Transitions between lifting and nonlifting upstrokes may be more subtle and gradual than implied by a binomial scheme of classification.

30161082|Largescale climate oscillations in earths history have influenced the directions of evolution, last but not least, through mass extinction events. This analysis tries to identify some unifying forces behind the course of evolution that favored an increase in organismic complexity and performance, paralleled by an increase in energy turnover, and finally led to endothermy. The analysis builds on the recent concept of oxygenlimited thermal tolerance and on the hypothesis that unifying principles exist in the temperaturedependent biochemical design of the eukaryotic cell in animals. The comparison of extant waterbreathing and airbreathing animal species from various climates provides a causeandeffect understanding of the tradeoffs and constraints in thermal adaptation and their energetic consequences. It is hypothesized that the high costs of functional adaptation to fluctuating temperatures, especially in the cold (cold eurythermy), cause an increase in energy turnover and, at the same time, mobility and agility. These costs are associated with elevated mitochondrial capacities at minimized levels of activation enthalpies for proton leakage. Cold eurythermy is seen as a precondition for the survival of evolutionary crises elicited by repeated cooling events during extreme climate fluctuations. The costs of cold eurythermy appear as the single most important reason why metazoan evolution led to life forms with high energy turnover. They also explain why dinosaurs were able to live in subpolar climates. Finally, they give insight into the pathways, benefits, and tradeoffs involved in the evolution of constant, elevated body temperature maintained by endothermy. Eurythermy, which encompasses cold tolerance, is thus hypothesized to be the missing link between ectothermy and endothermy. Body temperatures between 32 and 42C in mammals and birds then result from tradeoffs between the limiting capacities of ventilation and circulation and the evolutionary trend to maximize performance at the warm end of the thermal tolerance window.

10.1086/672372|Energy expenditure is a key mechanism underlying animal ecology, yet why individuals often differ in metabolic rate even under identical conditions remains largely unexplained. Individual variation in metabolism might be explained by correlations with other behavioral and physiological traits, with individual syndromes having environment- or state-dependent costs and benefits to fitness. We tested whether social rank within herds of female red deer is associated with individual differences in resting heart rate, an index of metabolic rate, and energetic response to monthly periods of food restriction during winter in a large outdoor enclosure near Vienna, Austria. Social rank had a strong positive effect on average daily heart rate, independent of the effects of food intake, air temperature, body temperature, and body mass. Subordinate individuals had lower heart rates than dominants, and consequently they suffered lower rates of body mass loss during periods of restricted pellet food supply. A greater capacity to minimize energy requirements might benefit the survival of subdominant female red deer during periods of negative energy balance in winter. Our study provides empirical support in a large mammal for linkages in behavior and metabolism within individuals that have environment-dependent consequences to the energy budget.

30161153|Food intakes of wild animals may not match their requirements for nutrients and energy but may vary between periods of nutritional excess (hyperphagia) and nutritional deficit (hypophagia) at timescales that vary from days to months. We present a simple model of feeding patterns and requirements of vertebrates. Frequent fasts and high intakes are typical of endothermic predators and migratory birds, whereas slow cycles and long deficits typify feeding patterns of ectothermic predators and ungulates in seasonal environments. We propose that hyperphagia is constrained by the ability to increase processes of digestion, absorption, intermediary metabolism, net deposition in tissue, and excretion to match loads of digesta and metabolites. Hyperphagia on highquality diets is limited by the clearance of metabolites, whereas digestive tract capacity and flow limit consumption of lowquality diets. Of all digestive strategies, small omnivores with simple digestive systems may be the most tolerant of frequent hyperphagia. Tolerance of hypophagia favors large endogenous stores or low massspecific rates of metabolism and reproductive output. Large animals may be most able to sustain reproduction during prolonged deficits in seasonal environments. Responses to excessive and deficient intakes of food are constrained by the length of the feeding cycle. Animals adapted to short feeding cycles may be best suited to unpredictable food supplies but at the energetic cost of maintaining spare capacity for digestion and absorption. Predictions of the response to food disruption are best evaluated in the context of body size, nutritional physiology, and life history of the species and the time for internal response.

30163969|Migrating songbirds interrupt their feeding to fly between stopover sites that may vary appreciably in diet quality. We studied the effects of fasting and food restriction on body composition and digestive organs in a migratory songbird and how these effects interacted with diet quality to influence the rate of recovery of nutrient reserves. Food limitation caused whitethroated sparrows to reduce both lean and fat reserves, with about 20% of the decline in lean mass represented by a decline in stomach, small intestine, and liver. During refeeding on diets similar in nutrient composition to either grain or fruit, foodlimited grainfed birds ate 40% more than did control birds, and they regained body mass, with on average 60% of the increase in body mass composed of lean mass including digestive organs. In contrast, foodlimited fruitfed birds did not eat more than did control birds and did not regain body mass, suggesting that a digestive constraint limited their food intake. The interacting effects of food limitation and diet quality on the dynamics of body composition and digestive organs in sparrows suggest that the adequacy of the diet at stopover sites can directly influence the rate of recovery of body reserves in migrating songbirds and hence the pace of their migration.

30158090|Selection studies are useful if they can provide us with insights into the patterns and processes of evolution in populations under controlled conditions. In this context it is particularly valuable to be able to analyze the limitations of and constraints on evolutionary responses to allow predictions concerning evolutionary change. The concept of a selection pathway is presented as a means of visualizing this predictive process and the constraints that help define the populations response to selection. As pointed out by Gould and Lewontin, history and chance are confounding forces that can mask or distort the adaptive response. Students of the evolutionary responses of organisms are very interested in the effects of these confounding forces, since they play a critical role not only in the laboratory but also in natural selection in the field. In this article, we describe some methods that are a bit different from those used in most studies for examining data from laboratory selection studies. These analytical methods are intended to provide insights into the physiological mechanisms by which evolutionary responses to the environment proceed. Interestingly, selection studies often exhibit disparate responses in replicate populations. We offer methods for analyzing these disparate responses in replicate populations to better understand this very important source of variability in the evolutionary response. We review the techniques of Travisano et al. and show that these approaches can be used to investigate the relative roles of adaptation, history, and chance in the evolutionary responses of populations of
30161083|Many elements of mammalian and avian thermoregulatory mechanisms are present in reptiles, and the changes involved in the transition to endothermy are more quantitative than qualitative. Drawing on our experience with reptiles and echidnas, we comment on that transition and on current theories about how it occurred. The theories divide into two categories, depending on whether selection pressures operated directly or indirectly on mechanisms producing heat. Both categories of theories focus on explaining the evolution of homeothermic endothermy but ignore heterothermy. However, noting that hibernation and torpor are almost certainly plesiomorphic (=ancestral, primitive), and that heterothermy is very common among endotherms, we propose that homeothermic endothermy evolved via heterothermy, with the earliest protoendotherms being facultatively endothermic and retaining their ectothermic capacity for constitutional eurythermy. Thus, unlike current models for the evolution of endothermy that assume that hibernation and torpor are specialisations arising from homeothermic ancestry, and therefore irrelevant, we consider that they are central. We note the sophistication of thermoregulatory behavior and control in reptiles, including precise control over conductance, and argue that brooding endothermy seen in some otherwise ectothermic Boidae suggests an incipient capacity for facultative endothermy in reptiles. We suggest that the earliest insulation in protoendotherms may have been internal, arising from redistribution of the fat bodies that are typical of reptiles. We note that shortbeaked echidnas provide a useful living model of what an (advanced) protoendotherm may have been like. Echidnas have the advantages of endothermy, including the capacity for homeothermic endothermy during incubation, but are very relaxed in their thermoregulatory precision and minimise energetic costs by using ectothermy facultatively when entering short or longterm torpor. They also have a substantial layer of internal dorsal insulation. We favor theories about the evolution of endothermy that invoke direct selection for the benefits conferred by warmth, such as expanding daily activity into the night, higher capacities for sustained activity, higher digestion rates, climatic range expansion, and, not unrelated, control over incubation temperature and the benefits for parental care. We present an indicative, stepwise schema in which observed patterns of body temperature are a consequence of selection pressures, the underlying mechanisms, and energy optimization, and in which homeothermy results when it is energetically desirable rather than as the logical endpoint.

In contrast, we estimated that approximately 100% and 20%80%, respectively, of the nitrogen in proteinaceous tissues of birds switched to high or lowprotein diets was attributable to dietary protein.

30158100|We report on a novel Djungarian hamster mutant lineage that exhibits a loss of uncoupling protein (UCP) 3 mRNA and protein in brown adipose tissue (BAT), whereas UCP3 expression in skeletal muscle is only mildly diminished. In response to 2 d of cold exposure, UCP3 mRNA was 4.5fold elevated in BAT of wildtype hamsters but remained undetectable in mutant hamsters. Notably, in BAT of warm and coldexposed mutant hamsters, UCP1 and UCP2 mRNA levels were increased. The tissue specificity of UCP3 deficiency suggests that the underlying unknown mutation impairs a factor controlling UCP3 gene expression selectively in brown adipocytes. In wildtype but not mutant primary brown adipocytes, UCP3 gene expression was stimulated by treatment with peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) ligands. This implies that the underlying mutation causing UCP3 deficiency is expressed within brown adipocytes and disrupts PPARdependant transactivation of the UCP3 gene. On the functional level, we found no direct phenotypic consequences of altered UCP expression in BAT. The absence of UCP3 in BAT of coldacclimated mutant hamsters affected neither maximal nonshivering thermogenesis elicited by noradrenaline nor the uncoupled respiration of isolated mitochondria in the presence of oligomycin and in response to palmitate.

Conserved elements of the surfactant system amongst distantly related species are likely to be crucial factors for successful lung development. Understanding the mechanisms by which the surfactant system becomes operational in animals with dramatically different birthing strategies and in distantly related species will provide important information about the role of the surfactant system in the commencement of air breathing and the processes regulating surfactant maturation and secretion.

PBZ11002|In marine osmoconformers, cells use organic osmolytes to maintain osmotic balance with seawater. High levels of urea are utilized in chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, skates, and chimaeras) for this purpose. Because of ureas perturbing nature, cells also accumulate counteracting methylamines, such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), at about a 21 ureamethylamine ratio, the most thermodynamically favorable mixture for protein stabilization, in shallow species. However, previous work on deep-sea teleosts (15 species) and chondrichthyans (three species) found an increase in muscle TMAO content and a decrease in urea content in chondrichthyans with depth. We hypothesized that TMAO counteracts protein destabilization resulting from hydrostatic pressure, as is demonstrated in vitro. Chondrichthyans are almost absent below 3,000 m, and we hypothesized that a limitation in urea excretion and/or TMAO retention might play a role. To test this, we measured the content of major organic osmolytes in white muscle of 13 chondrichthyan species caught with along-contour trawls at depths of 503,000 m; the deepest species caught was from 2,165 m. Urea and TMAO contents changed significantly with depth, with ureaTMAO declining from 2.96 in the shallowest (5090 m) groups to 0.67 in the deepest (1,9112,165 m) groups. Urea content was 291371 mmol/kg in the shallowest group and 170189 mmol/kg in the deepest group, declining linearly with depth and showing no plateau. TMAO content was 85168 mmol/kg in the shallowest group and 250289 mmol/kg in the deepest groups. With data from a previous study for a skate at 2,850 m included, a second-order polynomial fit suggested a plateau at the greatest depths. When data for skates (Rajidae) were analyzed separately, a sigmoidal fit was suggested. Thus, the deepest chondrichthyans may be unable to accumulate sufficient TMAO to counteract pressure; however, deeper-living specimens are needed to fully test this hypothesis.

We explore the consequences of the phenotypic plasticity available to animals, by examining physiological responses of freeliving animals in their natural habitats and by applying integrative, mechanistic models of heat exchange in invertebrates and humans. Specifically, we explore how behavioral, autonomic, and morphological modifications such as nocturnal activity, selective brain cooling, and body color may potentially serve as buffers to the consequences of climate change. Although some species may adapt to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, there are significant limits to this strategy. Furthermore, predictions of the response of organisms to changes in climate can be erroneous when modeled at large scales using coarse spatial or temporal data. Environmental heterogeneity can provide habitats suitable for species even though largescale changes in the climate might predict a species extinction. A detailed understanding of physiology, combined with integrative biophysical modeling and ecological manipulation, provides a powerful tool for predicting future ecological patterns and managing their consequences.

PBZ10073|Evolutionary shifts in diet composition are presumably accompanied by simultaneous changes in digestive physiology. The adaptive modulation hypothesis predicts that activities of digestive enzymes should match the relative levels of their substrates in an animals diet so that available membrane space and synthetic energy are not wasted on enzymes in excess of need. However, previous studies on captive passerine birds showed high intraspecific phenotypic flexibility only in proteases but not in carbohydrases in response to varying diet composition. In this study, we measured the activities of pancreatic, intestinal, and hepatic enzymes in six wild-caught passerine species. We predicted that if the adaptive modulation hypothesis holds during evolutionary shifts in diet composition in birds, then mass-specific activities of digestive enzymes should be correlated positively with the content of their relevant substrates in species diets. Whereas mass-specific activities of proteases (aminopeptidase-N, trypsin, chymotrypsin, alanine aminotransferase) were not correlated with estimated dietary protein content, mass-specific activities of all studied carbohydrases (amylase, maltase, sucrase) were positively correlated with estimated dietary starch content. We conclude that activities of carbohydrases but not proteases are evolutionarily matched to diet composition in passerine birds. We hypothesize that the need for nitrogen and essential amino acids can prevent the evolution of a low activity of proteases, even in species feeding on a low-protein diet.

Rather, excess resistance may have evolved as a byproduct of natural selection for tolerance to desiccation or other naturally occurring environmental agents.

Our results showed that free fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides were the major constituents of SC in larks from different environments including the Netherlands, a mesic environment; Iran, a semiarid region; and several areas in Saudi Arabia, a hot dry desert. We found that CWL was reduced among larks inhabiting deserts, but our data did not support the hypothesis that birds from desert environments have larger quantities of lipids per unit dry mass of the SC than larks from more mesic environments. Instead, larks in arid environments had a higher proportion of ceramides, especially the more polar fractions 46, and a smaller proportion of free fatty acids in their SC, an adjustment that apparently reduced their CWL. Subtle changes in the ratios of lipid classes can apparently alter the movement of water vapor through the skin. We hypothesize that desert birds have higher proportions of ceramides in their SC and lower proportions of free fatty acids because this combination allows the lipid lamellae to exist in a more highly ordered crystalline phase and consequently creates a tighter barrier to watervapor diffusion.

PBZ10156|Evaporation through the skin contributes to more than half of the total water loss in birds. Therefore, we expect the regulation of cutaneous water loss (CWL) to be crucial for birds, especially those that live in deserts, to maintain a normal state of hydration. Previous studies in adult birds showed that modifications of the lipid composition of the stratum corneum (SC), the outer layer of the epidermis, were associated with changes in rates of CWL. However, few studies have examined the ontogeny of CWL and the lipids of the SC in nestling birds. In this study, we measured CWL and the lipid composition of the SC during development of nestlings from two populations of house sparrows, one from the deserts of Saudi Arabia and the other from mesic Ohio. We found that desert and mesic nestlings followed different developmental trajectories for CWL. Desert nestlings seemed to make a more frugal use of water than did mesic nestlings. To regulate CWL, nestlings appeared to modify the lipid composition of the SC during ontogeny. Our results also suggest a tighter regulation of CWL in desert nestlings, presumably as a result of the stronger selection pressures to which nestlings are exposed in deserts.

30162259|Most shallowwater teleosts have moderate levels of trimethylamine Noxide (TMAO; 50 mmol/kg wet mass), a common osmolyte in many other marine animals. Recently, muscle TMAO contents were found to increase linearly with depth in six families. In one hypothesis, this may be an adaptation to counteract the deleterious effects of pressure on protein function, which TMAO does in vitro. In another hypothesis, TMAO may be accumulated as a byproduct of acylglycerol (AG) production, increasing with depth because of elevated lipid metabolisms known to occur in some deepsea animals. Here we analyze muscle TMAO contents and total body AG (mainly triacyglycerol [TAG]) levels in 15 species of teleosts from a greater variety of depths than sampled previously, including eight individual species caught at two or more depths. Including data of previous studies (total of 17 species, nine families), there is an apparent sigmoidal increase in TMAO contents between 0 and 1.4km depths, from about 40 to 150 mmol/kg.

10.1086/590163|Physiological processes that set an organisms thermal limits are in part determining recent shifts in biogeographic distribution ranges due to global climate change. Several characteristics of the heatshock response (HSR), such as the onset, maximal, and upper limit of heatshock protein (Hsp) synthesis, contribute to setting the acute upper thermal limits of most organisms. Aquatic animals from stable, moderately variable, or highly variable thermal environments differ in their HSR. Some animals living in extremely stable thermal environments lack the response altogether. In contrast, rocky intertidal animals that experience highly variable thermal conditions start synthesizing Hsps, that is, the onset of synthesis, below the highest temperatures that they experience. Thus, these organisms experience thermal conditions in their environment that are close to the upper thermal limits in which they can defend themselves against cellular thermal insults by employing the HSR. Subtidal animals are characterized by moderately variable thermal environments, and their cells start synthesizing Hsps above the highest temperatures that they experience. The upper thermal limits against which they can defend themselves are thus much higher than the highest body temperatures they currently experience. Furthermore, the ability to acclimate to changing thermal conditions seems greatest among animals from moderately variable environments and limited in animals from stable and highly variable environments. Thus, these findings suggest that organisms with the narrowest (stenothermal) and the widest (highly eurythermal) temperature tolerance ranges live closest to their thermal limits and have a limited ability to acclimate, suggesting that they will be most affected by global climate change.

10.1086/681263|Invasive cane toads are colonizing southeastern Australia via a narrow coastal strip sandwiched between unsuitable areas (Pacific Ocean to the east, mountains to the west). Many of the available spawning sites exhibit abiotic conditions (e.g., temperature, salinity, and pH) more extreme than those encountered elsewhere in the toads native or already invaded range. Will that challenge impede toad expansion? To answer that question, we measured pH in 35 ponds in northeastern New South Wales and 8 ponds in the Sydney region, in both areas where toads occur (and breed) and adjacent areas where toads are likely to invade, and conducted laboratory experiments to quantify effects of pH on the survival and development of toad eggs and larvae. Our field surveys revealed wide variation in pH (3.99.8) among natural water bodies. In the laboratory, the hatching success of eggs was increased at low pH (down to pH 4), whereas the survival, growth, and developmental rates of tadpoles were enhanced by higher pH levels. We found that pH influenced metamorph size and shape (relative head width, relative leg length) but not locomotor performance. The broad tolerance range of these early life-history stages suggests that pH conditions in ponds will not significantly slow the toads expansion southward. Indeed, toads may benefit from transiently low pH conditions, and habitat where pH in wetlands is consistently low (such as coastal heath) may enhance rather than reduce toad reproductive success. A broad physiological tolerance during embryonic and larval life has contributed significantly to the cane toads success as a widespread colonizer.

30161019|Hibernation is widely regarded as an adaptation to seasonal energy shortage, but the actual influence of energy availability on hibernation patterns is rarely considered. Here we review literature on the costs and benefits of torpor expression to examine the influence that energy may have on hibernation patterns. We first establish that the dichotomy between food and fatstoring hibernators coincides with differences in diet rather than body size and show that small or large species pursuing either strategy have considerable potential scope in the amount of torpor needed to survive winter. Torpor expression provides substantial energy savings, which increase the chance of surviving a period of food shortage and emerging with residual energy for early spring reproduction. However, all hibernating mammals periodically arouse to normal body temperatures during hibernation. The function of these arousals has long been speculated to involve recovery from physiological costs accumulated during metabolic depression, and recent physiological studies indicate these costs may include oxidative stress, reduced immunocompetence, and perhaps neuronal tissue damage. Using an optimality approach, we suggest that tradeoffs between the benefits of energy conservation and the physiological costs of metabolic depression can explain both why hibernators periodically arouse from torpor and why they should use available energy to minimize the depth and duration of their torpor bouts. On the basis of these tradeoffs, we derive a series of testable predictions concerning the relationship between energy availability and torpor expression. We conclude by reviewing the empirical support for these predictions and suggesting new avenues for research on the role of energy availability in mammalian hibernation.

Research in oviparous taxa has demonstrated that there is amongspecies variability in their response to these maternal contributions. However, studies in chelonians and crocodilians have been hampered by the fact that techniques involving egg manipulations that breach the eggshell routinely result in massive egg mortality. In this study, we present an improved yolk manipulation technique that resulted in increased egg survival (in excess of 70% survival) in the redeared slider turtle (
10.1086/591806|In this study, field biotelemetry and laboratory physiology approaches were coupled to allow understanding of the behavioral and physiological responses of fish to winter hypoxia. The biotelemetry study compared dissolved oxygen levels measured throughout the winter period with continually tracked locations of nine adult largemouth bass obtained from a wholelake submerged telemetry array. Fish habitat usage was compared with habitat availability to assess whether fish were selecting for specific dissolved oxygen concentrations. The laboratory study examined behavioral and physiological responses to progressive hypoxia in juvenile largemouth bass acclimated to winter temperatures. Results from the dissolved oxygen measurements made during the biotelemetry study showed high variance in underice dissolved oxygen levels. Avoidance of water with dissolved oxygen <2.0 mg/L by telemetered fish was demonstrated, but significant use of water with intermediate dissolved oxygen levels was also found. Results from the lab experiments showed marked changes in behavior (i.e., yawning and vertical movement) at <2.0 mg/L of dissolved oxygen but no change in tissue lactate, an indicator of anaerobic metabolism. Combined results of the biotelemetry and laboratory studies demonstrate that a dissolved oxygen content of 2.0 mg/L may be a critical threshold that induces behavioral responses by largemouth bass during the winter. In addition, the use by fish of areas with intermediate levels of dissolved oxygen suggests that there are multiple environmental factors influencing winter behavior.
10.1086/666057|In species with repeated bouts of reproduction, a females ability to retain sufficient tissue for self-maintenance is essential to her survival and capacity for future reproduction. Loss of bone mineral content results in bone fragility and the possibility of reduced survival, so females should guard against the overuse of their bone mineral during reproduction. Given these constraints, I predicted that bone mobilization would increase with litter size in mice but plateau before maximum litter size was reached. To test this idea, I manipulated the litter sizes of house mice on the day of parturition to 3, 8, 13, and 18 offspring. At weaning, I euthanized the females and calculated whole-body and bone mineral composition. The total mineral content of females femurs dropped as litter size increased to the average litter size for this strain of mouse (13) but surprisingly, femoral mineral content was higher for females assigned the largest litter sizes (18). Seven of the nine females assigned 18 young cannibalized some of their offspring. For females assigned to these larger litters, femoral ash content was not correlated with number of young consumed, suggesting that mineral recycling had little effect on final bone mineral content. However, nursing effort (accounting for young lost to cannibalism) was correlated with maternal femoral ash at weaning. These finding suggest that the high bone mineral content of females assigned the largest litters was associated with a reduction in endogenous mineral allocated to the litter.

10.1086/594380|The fangs of vipers are extremely long, rotating, hollow teeth. Analysis of video records of more than 750 strikes recorded at 60 or 250 frames per second for 285 individuals representing 86 species in 31 genera shows that vipers reposition fangs after initial contact with prey in more than a third of the strikes. Repositioning resulted when fangs missed prey entirely or hit prey regions that did not permit adequate penetration. The prevalence of repositioning, even among species that normally release prey, suggests strong selective pressure for rapid neuromotor response to fang placement error. The rapidity of repositioning suggests the existence of (a) finescale sensory detection of fang penetration depth, (b) rapid modulation of contraction of antagonistic muscles, and (c) possibly neurological modifications to shorten transmission time between sensory input and motor output. Extreme fang length has apparently coevolved with extreme functions.
30161175|Fish have a central respiratory pattern generator (CRPG) in the brain stem that initiates activity in a series of cranial nerves innervating respiratory muscles. These nerves burst sequentially in the order of their rostrocaudal distribution in the central nervous system. When respiratory drive is high, this activity spreads caudally to occipital and anterior spinal neurons that project via the hypobranchial nerves to stimulate hypaxial muscles, causing active jaw abduction. The CRPG may also recruit the heart. Fish, like mammals, show respiratory components in the intrinsic variability of heart rate (HRV). Cardiorespiratory synchrony in the dogfish is driven by bursting activity in the cardiac branches of the vagus nerve, which emanates from preganglionic neurons in the dorsal vagal motor nucleus. A respiratory component in HRV is difficult to discriminate in other species, requiring the use of power spectral analysis and the subsequent elimination of aliased components.
30158433|Recently, there has been considerable interest in the role of the immune system in shaping lifehistory evolution, sexual selection strategies, and indexes of individual quality. The most frequently used assay of immune function, particularly in avian field studies, is the phytohemagglunitin (PHA) skin test. PHA is injected subcutaneously into the wing web, and the magnitude of the resultant swelling has traditionally been interpreted as an index of an individuals cellmediated immunocompetence. The test follows one of two protocols: the traditional twowing injection protocol, with one wing web injected with PHA and the other with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), or the simplified onewing protocol that omits the PBS injection. In this technical comment, we alert researchers to the importance of considering handling time when performing the PHA test. We show that zebra finches (

30161298|Carotenoids are important dietary constituents in birds. They serve as pigments and play numerous physiological roles in both the laying hen and developing embryo. However, factors determining the absorption of carotenoids and their allocation to different functions are numerous and complex, and causal relationships are generally poorly known. Our objective was to determine the degree to which carotenoid levels in egg yolks and the plasma of hens were influenced by differences in diet and reproductive output in captive redlegged partridges. Carotenoid concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography in two feeds (high and low carotenoid content) and in yolks and plasma of hens near the start and end of laying. Early in the laying season, plasma and yolk carotenoids varied with diet and were correlated with one another. Late in the season, a dietary effect was evident only for yolks, and there was no relationship between plasma and egg levels of individual hens. However, plasma carotenoids at the end of laying were strongly correlated with the number of eggs that had been laid. Dietary availability, although important, could explain some variation in carotenoid levels in plasma and egg yolks only in the context of reproductive history.

Seals routinely undergo protracted fasting, which is normally associated with physiological stress in other animals. We tested the hypotheses that (1) relative HSP70 protein abundance is higher in liver and blubber of fasting relative to suckling wild gray seal pups; (2) differences in HSP70 are mirrored in tissue superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity, as well as glutathione levels; (3) extracellular HSP70 correlates with hepatic and blubber HSP70 abundance; and (4) protein carbonylation, an index of oxidative damage, is lower in tissues with higher levels of these cellular stress markers. In contrast to our expectation, suckling pups had higher relative HSP70 abundance and glutathione levels in liver and blubber and higher hepatic catalase activity. Plasma HSP70 did not correlate with liver or blubber abundance of the protein. Suckling pups did not experience greater protein carbonylation, suggesting that cellular protective mechanisms prevent protein damage despite an apparent increase in cellular stress. SOD activity was not affected by nutritional state, but in blubber tissue, it was positively correlated with blubber thickness. Greater requirements for antioxidants and HSPs in suckling pups or in animals with thicker blubber could arise from rapid protein synthesis, high metabolic fuel availability, and/or exposure to lipophilic toxins. Developmental and nutritional changes in cellular defenses have important implications for gray seals susceptibility to additional stress exposure.

Although relatively simplistic compared with parental behaviors of other taxa, python eggbrooding behavior exemplifies parental care because it mediates a tradeoff between embryonic respiration and hydration. However, because egg brooding increases gasexchange resistance between embryonic and nest environments and because female pythons do not adjust their brooding behavior in response to the increasing metabolic requirements of developing offspring, python egg brooding imposes hypoxic costs on embryos during the late stages of incubation. We conducted a series of experiments to determine whether eggshells coadapted with brooding behavior to minimize the negative effects of developmental hypoxia. We tested the hypotheses that python eggshells (1) increase permeability over time to accommodate increasing embryonic respiration and (2) exhibit permeability plasticity in response to chronic hypoxia. Over incubation, we serially measured the atomic and structural components of Childrens python (

30161073|Minimal metabolic rate represents the minimal cost of living and appears to have the same relative composition of adenosine triphosphate processes in all organisms. Minimal metabolic rate is influenced by temperature and defines the standard metabolic rate (SMR) of animals. Animals that achieve SMR only for a given temperature are strictly ectothermic. Endotherms, on the other hand, are characterized by leakier membranes and an associated increase in cellular metabolism for a given temperature. The increase in cellular metabolism is coupled with an increase in heat production (i.e., obligatory thermogenesis) that, together with SMR, defines the basal metabolic rate of an endotherm. Consideration of minimal metabolic rate must take into account ecological and physiological processes, environmental influences, evolutionary arguments, and body size.

Much variation may be due to changes in prevalence and abundance of pathogens (and/or their vectors) in time and space, but the costs of immune defenses themselves may also be important. Induction of immune activity often increases energy and protein expenditure, sometimes to the point of compromising fitness. Whether immune defenses are expensive to maintain once they are generated, however, is less well appreciated. If so, organisms would face persistent challenges of allocating resources between immunity and other expensive physiological processes, which would mandate tradeoffs.

Here we explore the reasons for this renewed interest and provide four examples of how this is happening. Specifically, we examine links between molecular physiology and ecological realities in insect responses to thermal stress, vertebrate responses to anoxia, metabolic fuel use and torpor in mammals, and the recently developed metabolic theory of ecology. Several novel insights are emerging from integrated approaches to these problems that might not have come forward from any single perspective on them. Nonetheless, prospects for linking molecular physiology and ecological realities are likely to remain poor if greater focus is not given to developing these links. Mostly, this is a consequence of the differing approaches and languages adopted by these fields. We discuss approaches by which the prospects for synthetic work might be improved.

30161303|In phocid seals, the transition to nutritional independence is abrupt, with females abandoning their offspring after weaning and returning to sea. We hypothesized that body size at weaning may play an important role in the nature of this transition. We studied the changes in body composition and water flux of newly weaning harbour seals over the first 46 wk postweaning. Thirtythree pups were dosed with deuterium oxide to estimate total body water (TBW) and a subset of 24 was dosed twice to estimate changes in body composition and water flux. All pups lost body mass over the study period, but TBW increased during the period of mass loss, indicating continued lean tissue growth. Combined data from this and our early study indicated that heavy (>median mass) pups were relatively fatter (41.0% vs. 37.1%) and had significantly greater total body energy at weaning than did light ( median mass) pups. Percentage TBW declined linearly over time in light pups but was constant in heavy pups for the first 19 d postweaning and then declined linearly. Both the temporal pattern and composition of mass loss differed between light and heavy pups. Estimated food intake increased in the second 2 wk of study compared to the first 2 wk, in both light and heavy pups, reflecting increased foraging success but at levels still insufficient to meet daily expenditures of most individuals.

30160092|A variety of mammalian lineages have secondarily invaded the water. To locomote and thermoregulate in the aqueous medium, mammals developed a range of morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations. A distinct difference in the suite of adaptations, which affects energetics, is apparent between semiaquatic and fully aquatic mammals. Semiaquatic mammals swim by paddling, which is inefficient compared to the use of oscillating hydrofoils of aquatic mammals. Semiaquatic mammals swim at the water surface and experience a greater resistive force augmented by wave drag than submerged aquatic mammals. A dense, nonwettable fur insulates semiaquatic mammals, whereas aquatic mammals use a layer of blubber. The fur, while providing insulation and positive buoyancy, incurs a high energy demand for maintenance and limits diving depth. Blubber contours the body to reduce drag, is an energy reserve, and suffers no loss in buoyancy with depth. Despite the high energetic costs of a semiaquatic existence, these animals represent modern analogs of evolutionary intermediates between ancestral terrestrial mammals and their fully aquatic descendants. It is these intermediate animals that indicate which potential selection factors and mechanical constraints may have directed the evolution of more derived aquatic forms.

In birds, the period shortly after hatching is an energetically demanding stage characterized by rapid growth in body size and organ systems, including the immune system.

Yet there is surprisingly little empirical evidence to support a strong, positive relationship between egg size and offspring quality (i.e., offspring growth, condition, and survival) in birds, in part because of confounding effects of parental quality and the lack of experimental techniques for directly manipulating avian egg size independently of maternal condition. Previously, we showed that treatment of laying female zebra finches (
30160076|We tested the hypothesis that birds in arid environments, where primary productivity is low and surface water is scarce, have reduced energy expenditure and water loss compared with their mesic counterparts. Using both conventional least squares regression and regression based on phylogenetically independent contrasts, we showed that birds from desert habitats have reduced basal and field metabolic rates compared with species from mesic areas. Previous work showed that desert birds have reduced rates of total evaporative water loss when exposed to moderate environmental temperatures in the laboratory. We tested whether reduced rates of total evaporative water loss translate into low field water fluxes. Conventional ANCOVA indicated that desert birds have reduced water fluxes, but an analysis based on phylogenetically independent contrasts did not support this finding, despite the wide array of taxonomic affiliations of species in the data set. We conclude that the high ambient temperatures, the low primary productivity, and the water scarcity in desert environments have selected for or resulted in reduced rates of energy expenditure and evaporative water loss in birds that live in these climes.

10.1086/648487|For decades, researchers have documented significant skews in the production of male versus female offspring in many species. Because males and females are differentially susceptible to environmental challenges and also represent different fitness benefits, it may be beneficial to exert control over the offspring sex ratio when environmental conditions become challenging. Some of the most dramatic environmental challenges occur on a seasonal basis. Indeed, seasonal variation in offspring sex ratios has been documented in both mammalian and nonmammalian species. The seasonal environmental factor (or factors) that drives the skews in sex ratios is unknown; however, it is essential that such a cue be predictable and reliable and that it does not vary from year to year. We hypothesized that photoperiod, a stable cue of seasonal changes in temperature and resource availability, may underlie seasonal variation in offspring sex ratios of mammals. We predicted that short day lengths in particular, which signal impending winter conditions and related energetic demands, would stimulate an anticipatory skew in the offspring sex ratio. We used Siberian hamsters as models because they are phenotypically responsive to photoperiod but up to 60% of females continue to breed during the winter. The sexes of weanling hamsters conceived and raised in short, winterlike day lengths were significantly skewed toward males. Furthermore, these skews occurred before birth; embryos collected from pregnant females maintained in shortday conditions were also significantly male biased. Thus, photoperiod functions as an effective seasonal cue, stimulating sex ratio skews toward males when day lengths are short.

However, in the past several years, several bodies of work have emerged that have examined both selection on performance capacity and selection in a community context, and our goal is to highlight these two growing areas and point toward future directions. Recent studies of selection on performance capacity point toward directional selection favoring high levels of performance, and we detected less evidence for selection favoring intermediate (i.e., stabilizing) or bimodal (i.e., disruptive) kinds of performance levels. Studies of selection in a community context, using the paradigm of indirect genetic effects, show significant community heritability and strong capacity for evolution to occur in a community context via the force of natural selection. For future directions, we argue that researchers should shift toward longerterm studies of selection on both individual species and communities, and we also encourage researchers to publish negative selection results for both performance and community studies to act as balancing influences on published positive selection results.

In this study, we measured body mass and various hematological condition indices in breeding great tits in relation to local survival. Number and quality of nestlings and the occurrence of second broods, potentially reflecting parents breeding effort, were also considered in analyses. The great tits, both male and female, that returned the following year had had a higher albumin/globulin ratio, lower plasma globulin concentration, and a lower heterophile/lymphocyte ratio during breeding in the preceding year, compared to those who did not return. Surviving males (but not females) also had had a higher level of circulating lymphocytes, compared to nonsurvivors. There was no correlation between breeding effort and survival. We conclude that better immunological state and lower stress in great tits during breeding were positively related to their survival probability.
10.1086/674974|Proper adjustments of physiology and behavior are required for small mammals to cope with seasonal climate change. The aim of this study was to examine the role of leptin in the regulation of body mass and energy budget in striped hamsters. We first investigated seasonal changes in body mass, energy budget, and serum leptin levels in hamsters acclimated to outdoor natural daylight and ambient temperature. Then we assessed the effect of leptin administration on energy budget, serum lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities, and gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue and of hypothalamic neuropeptides associated with the regulation of energy balance in hamsters maintained at 21 and 5C. Hamsters showed constant body mass throughout the four seasons but significantly increased food intake and thermogenesis in winter, compared to summer. Minimum body fat was observed in winter, and minimum serum leptin was found in autumn. Hamsters housed at 5C showed higher energy intake, upregulated gene expression of UCP1 and hormone-sensitive lipase, and lower fat content and LPL and HL activity than the animals maintained at 21C. Leptin administration had no effect on energy intake but increased maximal thermogenic capacity, as indicated by upregulated UCP1 gene expression at both 21 and 5C. Body fat and activity of LPL and HL were decreased in hamsters treated with leptin. The results suggest that leptin plays an important role in the seasonal regulation of thermogenic capacity and body composition in striped hamsters. Leptin may be involved in increasing maximal thermogenesis in the cold rather than acting as a starvation signal to increase energy intake.
10.1086/668852|Organisms that breed multiple times must trade off resources between current and future reproduction.

30097047|Agespecific forced polymorphism is the presence of two or more distinct phenotypes (here we consider only males) that occur in separate sexually mature age groups (e.g., horns in older males but not younger males). The lifestage morph maturation hypothesis posits that all younger males that possess a particular structure can transform into older males with a different structure, most likely via the influence of hormones. The lifestage morph selection hypothesis posits that polymorphism is due to intense selection resulting in a highly nonrandom sample of younger males surviving to become older males, thus leading to different mean phenotypes in different age groups. We conducted an extensive review of literature from the past 20 years (19832003) for cases of agespecific forced polymorphism. Overall, we found only a few cases that fit our criteria of agespecific forced polymorphism, and we argue that most (e.g., orangutans, elephant seals) have likely arisen via the lifestage morph maturation mechanism, but we also present several examples (e.g., green anole lizards) that appear to be candidates for lifestage morph selection. However, none of the reviewed studies provided enough information (e.g., age of morphs, growth patterns of the morphological structure) to definitively invoke either of the two mechanisms. We suggest that agespecific forced polymorphism is more common than reflected in this review and that future studies should gather demographic and laboratory data that will directly compare the lifestage morph maturation and lifestage morph selection hypotheses.
10.1086/666988|Immune defense may vary as a result of trade-offs with other life-history traits or in parallel with variation in antigen levels in the environment. We studied lark species (Alaudidae) in the Arabian Desert and temperate Netherlands to test opposing predictions from these two hypotheses. Based on their slower pace of life, the trade-off hypothesis predicts relatively stronger immune defenses in desert larks compared with temperate larks. However, as predicted by the antigen exposure hypothesis, reduced microbial abundances in deserts should result in desert-living larks having relatively weaker immune defenses. We quantified host-independent and host-dependent microbial abundances of culturable microbes in ambient air and from the surfaces of birds. We measured components of immunity by quantifying concentrations of the acute-phase protein haptoglobin, natural antibody-mediated agglutination titers, complement-mediated lysis titers, and the microbicidal ability of whole blood. Desert-living larks were exposed to significantly lower concentrations of airborne microbes than temperate larks, and densities of some bird-associated microbes were also lower in desert species. Haptoglobin concentrations and lysis titers were also significantly lower in desert-living larks, but other immune indexes did not differ. Thus, contrary to the trade-off hypothesis, we found little evidence that a slow pace of life predicted increased immunological investment. In contrast, and in support of the antigen exposure hypothesis, associations between microbial exposure and some immune indexes were apparent. Measures of antigen exposure, including assessment of host-independent and host-dependent microbial assemblages, can provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying immunological variation.

However, accumulating work on tropical species has shown divergent patterns of T in association with breeding behavior.

10.1086/648567|Despite decades of research on the evolution of thermal physiology, at least one fundamental issue remains unresolved: whether the maximal performance of a genotype depends on its optimal temperature. One school argues that warmadapted genotypes will outperform coldadapted genotypes because high temperatures inevitably accelerate chemical reactions. Yet another school holds that biochemical adaptation can compensate for thermodynamic effects on performance. Here, we briefly discuss this theoretical debate and then summarize empirical studies that address whether hotter is better. In general, comparative and experimental studies support the view that hotter is better. Furthermore, recent modeling has shown that thermodynamic constraints impose unique selective pressures on thermal sensitivity. Nevertheless, the thermodynamic effect on maximal performance varies greatly among traits and taxa, suggesting the need to develop a more sophisticated view of thermodynamic constraints.

30160030|This study examined the seasonal and reproductive influences on individual plasma amino acid concentrations and nitrogen metabolites in a black bear population (Ontario, Canada). During hibernation, 11 of 23 plasma amino acids were significantly higher (13%108%) in lactating than in nonlactating females, without an alteration in plasma total protein or total essential or nonessential amino acid levels. The greatest changes were observed in glutamine, arginine, and glycine levels. Plasma urea, urea/creatinine, and ammonia levels were significantly lower in hibernating compared with active female bears, but lactation had no effect on these parameters. Taken together these results show that lactation during hibernation is an additional metabolic challenge that results in increased mobilization of individual plasma amino acids and no accumulation of nitrogen end products, underlining the remarkable efficiency of amino acid and urea recycling in denning female black bears.

10.1086/677922|Tropical and temperate birds provide a unique system to examine mechanistic consequences of life-history trade-offs at opposing ends of the pace-of-life spectrum; tropical birds tend to have a slow pace of life whereas temperate birds the opposite. Birds in the tropics have a lower whole-animal basal metabolic rate and peak metabolic rate, lower rates of reproduction, and longer survival than birds in temperate regions. Although skeletal muscle has a relatively low tissue-specific metabolism at rest, it makes up the largest fraction of body mass and therefore contributes more to basal metabolism than any other tissue. A principal property of muscle cells that influences their rate of metabolism is fiber size. The optimal fiber size hypothesis attempts to link whole-animal basal metabolic rate to the cost of maintaining muscle mass by stating that larger fibers may be metabolically cheaper to maintain since the surface areavolume ratio (SAV) is reduced compared with smaller fibers and thus the amount of area to transport ions is also reduced. Because tropical birds have a reduced whole-organism metabolism, we hypothesized that they would have larger muscle fibers than temperate birds, given that larger muscle fibers have reduced energy demand from membrane Na

10.1086/669973|Behavioral responses of elasmobranch fishes to weak electric fields have been well studied. These studies typically employ a stimulator that produces a dipole electric field intended to simulate the natural electric field of prey items. However, the characteristics of bioelectric fields have not been well described. The magnitude and frequency of the electric field produced by 11 families of marine organisms were quantified in this study. Invertebrate electric potentials ranged from 14 to 28 V and did not differ from those of elasmobranchs, which ranged from 18 to 30 V. Invertebrates and elasmobranchs produced electric potentials smaller than those of teleost fishes, which ranged from 39 to 319 V. All species produced electric fields within the frequency range that is detectable by elasmobranch predators (<16 Hz), with the highest frequencies produced by the penaeids (10.3 Hz) and the gerreids (4.6 Hz). Although voltage differed by family, there was no relationship between voltage and mass or length of prey. Differences in prey voltage may be related to osmoregulatory strategies; invertebrates and elasmobranchs are osmoconformers and have less ion exchange with the surrounding seawater than teleosts species, which are hyposmotic. As predicted, voltage production was greatest at the mucous membranelined mouth and gills, which are sites of direct ion exchange with the environment.
30163957|Embryonic physiology is often viewed as merely those processes understood for the adult but conducted on a smaller physical scale. Yet striking examples of the inaccuracy of this perspective can be identified in the embryonic cardiovascular system. For example, dogma holds that the embryonic heart begins to beat to pump blood for convective transport, just like that of the adult. This is the major assumption inherent in the hypothesis we have called convective synchronotropy; that is, the embryonic heart starts to beat synchronously with the need for convective blood flow. However, there is compelling evidence on many fronts that the convective flow of blood generated by the early embryonic vertebrate heart is simply not required for transport of oxygen, nutrients, metabolic wastes, or hormones, all of which can be achieved entirely by diffusion. In fact, fish, amphibian, and bird embryos lacking a functional heart (either through surgical intervention or mutation) or whose oxygenhemoglobin transport has been chemically eliminated nonetheless continue to function and grow in size for extended periods up to the point at which diffusion alone can no longer serve oxygen transport needs. We advocate the alternative hypothesis of prosynchronotropy (i.e., the heart starts to beat well before convective blood flow is needed for bulk transport). So, what is the purpose of the early embryonic heart beat? Evidence is presented herein in support of a morphogenic rationale for prosynchronotropy. Specifically, it appears that the initial rationale for the beat of the vertebrate embryonic heart may be twofold: to aid in subtle but significant aspects of cardiac growth, shaping, and maturation, and to facilitate cardiac maturation angiogenesisthe formation of new vessels by sprouting from vessel tips. Ultimately, the embryonic cardiovascular system provides a graphic demonstration of how adult physiological functions should not, without verification, be interpolated back to the embryo of that species.

30162237|We studied castrated adult muskoxen fed a standard diet of grass hay and supplement throughout the year to determine seasonal changes in digesta passage, fill, and fermentation without the confounding effects of reproductive demands or changes in food quality. Although food intake increased by 74% between spring and autumn, mean retention times of fluid and particulate digesta markers were maintained between seasons in both the rumen (913 h) and the intestines (2737 h). The rumen contained 84.5% of digesta and accounted for 79% of dry matter digestion in the whole digestive tract. Ruminal fluid space and wholegut digesta fill increased by 31%34%, while ruminal rates of in situ degradation increased by more than 100% between spring and autumn for cellulose and hemicellulose. Hyperphagia in autumn was accompanied by increased bacterial counts in ruminal fluid (30%), declines in ruminal pH, and increases in the concentration of fermentation acids (16%) when compared with spring hypophagia. Consumption of fresh hay and supplement increased the concentrations of acids most markedly during winter and spring when bacterial counts were low. Low food intakes in winter and spring may limit the microbial population, whereas hyperphagia in autumn may foster a much more active microflora that requires consistent supplies of substrate. Plasticity of fill and fermentation in muskoxen minimizes winter costs and maximizes nutrients and energy gained from coarse forages in small home ranges throughout the year.
30158378|Selective breeding produced four replicate lines of highrunner (HR) mice that run on wheels for approximately 2.7 times more revolutions per day than four unselected control lines. Previous studies found that HR mice of both sexes have lower body fat (isotope dilution at 15 wk of age) and that males (females not studied) have smaller retroperitoneal fat pads (17 wk). HR mice also exhibit elevated plasma corticosterone and insulinstimulated glucose uptake by some hindlimb muscles but apparently do not differ in circulating insulin or glucose levels (males at 18 wk). Given their lower body fat and higher activity levels, we hypothesized that HR mice would have lower circulating leptin levels than controls. Female mice were given wheel access for 6 d at 7 wk of age, as part of the routine wheel testing for the selective breeding protocol, and then were killed after one additional week without wheels to reduce possible acute effects of activity on leptin. As hypothesized, serum leptin levels were significantly lower in HR mice. ANCOVA indicated that leptin was strongly positively correlated with both total body fat (measured by ether extraction) and body mass change from weaning, but HR mice still had significantly lower adjusted leptin levels (ANCOVA). Within HR lines but not within control lines, individual variation in leptin levels was negatively correlated with amount or speed of wheel running measured a week before being killed. Growth from weaning to euthanasia and body dry mass were lower in HR mice than in controls, but absolute dry masses of the ventricles, liver, gut, and uterus plus ovaries did not significantly differ, nor did percentage of the total dry mass as fat. HR mice offer a novel model for studying the causes and consequences of physiologically relevant variations in serum leptin.

Here we identify population variation in egg mass, length, width, and volume from diamondback terrapin
10.1086/680168|Food limitation is a common ecological scenario for nestling altricial birds, and reductions in growth and maintenance have been observed in resource-limited nestlings. Substantial development of the immune system occurs during the nestling period, yet the resource dependence of this immune development is understudied. We examined constitutive immune system development as well as acute-phase responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection after 48 h of food restriction in house sparrows at 7 and 13 d posthatch. We also examined nestlings that were restricted early (57 d) but refed and tested at 13 d posthatch to determine whether altered immune function and growth early in the nestling period were recovered upon return to adequate resource supply. Induced acute-phase protein response was reduced in food-restricted birds, yet no lasting reductions in acute-phase protein levels were observed in previously restricted nestlings that were challenged with LPS after refeeding. Food restriction did not significantly impact constitutive levels of complement-mediated lysis or circulating IgY antibodies. As a comparator to immune measures, we found that organ and tarsus size, as well as muscle size and citrate synthase enzyme activity (an index of muscle cellular aerobic capacity), were significantly reduced in food-restricted nestlings. Reductions in flight muscle mass and function persisted in birds refed after early food restriction, which may have contributed to persistent body temperature reductions observed in refed birds.

10.1086/670811|Island organisms face a range of extrinsic threats to their characteristically small populations. Certain biological differences between island and continental organisms have the potential to exacerbate these threats. Understanding how island birds differ from their continental relatives may provide insight into population viability and serve as a predictive tool for conservation efforts. We compared an eastern bluebird population in Ohio with a threatened population in Bermuda in terms of the birds development, morphology, immunology, and reproduction. These comparisons revealed that island nestlings had shorter wings and island adults had longer wings than their continental analogs. Island nestlings also had shorter tarsi than continental nestlings at day 8 posthatch, but this difference was absent at day 15 and in adults. Adults weighed less in Bermuda than in Ohio, and both nestlings and adults in Bermuda exhibited higher levels of two immunological indexes (concentrations of an acute-phase protein and titers of nonspecific antibodies). Clutch sizes and hatch rates did not differ between the island and continental populations; however, as the breeding season progressed, brood sizes declined in Bermuda, whereas no such decline occurred in Ohio. Despite these differences and differences in nestling development, island and continental parents fed their nestlings at equal rates. Overall, our results suggest that the Bermuda phenotype may be adjusted to certain aspects of the island environment but not to others. Efforts to conserve the bluebirds of Bermuda may be improved by focusing on the intraseasonal patterns in nestling mortality and, more generally, the survival probabilities of different age classes.

Understanding the environmental circumstances and the morphological and functional changes underlying the fishtetrapod transition have been goals of comparative biologists for many decades. Although the fossil record of this transition remains far from complete, new discoveries in the past two decades have increased the resolution of the morphological sequence, documented the relative rapidity and geographic distribution of the tetrapod appearance, and fueled new controversy over the environmental and biological factors involved. Biologists have also searched for insights into the vertebrate land invasion through comparative studies of the living amphibious and airbreathing fishes. Such investigations include a wide range of environmental and functional topics, including habitat conditions, biochemistry, functional morphology, physiology, behavior, ecology, and biogeography. The seven articles in this volume are stateoftheart assessments of topics ranging from the fishtetrapod fossil record to diverse aspects of the behavior, physiology, biochemistry, and ecology of the extant fish species that use either or both terrestriality and air breathing.

PBZ10006|Temperature influences almost all life-history traits. For a period of 3 mo, we placed four groups of snakes under four contrasted thermal treatments: (1) a natural regime (NR), based on daily variations (24-h cycle); (2) an accelerated regime (AR), where the thermoperiod fluctuated rapidly (12-h cycle); (3) a slow regime (SR; 48-h cycle); and (4) a cool stable regime (ZR; no fluctuation). The mean temperature, set at 23C, was identical for the four groups. For the first three groups (NR, AR, SR), ambient temperature fluctuated between 18C and 28C. Relative humidity and photoperiod were constant. We recorded feeding success, digestion efficiency, growth rate, activity, and ecdysis events. Differences between groups were expected because of varied exposure to the optimal temperatures, most notably in the ZR group, where the preferred body temperature for digestion (30C) would not be reached. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the experimental treatment on feeding rate, digestion, body mass increase, and growth rate. Our results do not conform to the paradigm stipulating that maximal body temperature selected by ectotherms necessarily corresponds to the most efficient for resource assimilation and that temperature fluctuations are essential. We propose that increasing the digestive tracts performance through body-temperature elevation trades off against elevated (parasite) energy expenditure from the rest of the body. The main advantage of high body temperatures would be to reduce the amount of time necessary to assimilate prey rather than to improve the net mass gain during digestion.

Nine species from the classes Heterotardigrada and Eutardigrada were exposed to temperatures of up to 110C for 1 h. Exposure to temperatures of up to 80C resulted in a moderate decrease in survival.

10.1086/674537|We have previously shown that ecological habit (e.g., arboreal, terrestrial, amphibious) correlates with thermoregulatory behaviors and water balance physiology among species of hylid frogs in northern Australia. We hypothesized that these frogs would be different with respect to their field hydration states because of the challenges associated with the different ecological habits. There are very few data on the hydration levels that frogs maintain in the field, and the existing data are from disparate species and locations and do not relate hydration state to habit or changes in seasonal water availability. We measured the hydration state of 15 species of frogs from tropical northern Australia to determine the influences of ecological habit and season on the hydration state that these frogs maintain. As predicted, frogs were significantly less hydrated in the dry season than they were in the wet season and showed significantly higher variation among individuals, suggesting that maintaining hydration is more challenging in the dry season. In the wet season, terrestrial species were significantly less hydrated than arboreal or amphibious species. During the dry season, amphibious species that sought refuge in cracking mud after the pond dried were significantly less hydrated than terrestrial or arboreal species. These data suggest that hydration behaviors and voluntary tolerance of dehydration vary with habitat use, even within closely related species in the same family or genus. Terrestrial and arboreal species might be expected to be the most vulnerable to changes in water availability, because they are somewhat removed from water sources, but the physiological characteristics of arboreal frogs that result in significant cutaneous resistance to water loss allow them to reduce the effects of their dehydrating microenvironment.
30158006|We studied the ontogeny of shivering thermogenesis in breast and leg muscles of precocial galliforms (domestic fowl, grey partridge, and Japanese quail) and the altricial domestic pigeon using electromyography (EMG) and indirect calorimetry. Galliforms were able to increase heat production by shivering in leg muscles at the youngest age studied (12 d). Pectorals contributed to heat production from days 710 onward, but in the partridge and especially in the fowl, shivering by the pectorals was weaker than in the quail. In the pigeon, shivering began in pectorals and legs at 2 and 4 d of age, respectively, and pectorals had clearly the predominant role in thermogenesis. Despite the early beginning of electrical signs of shivering, significant thermogenesis did not appear in the pigeon before the age of 6 d. All galliforms shivered in bursts, like pigeons aged 24 d. From the age of 6 d onward, continuous shivering became predominant in the pigeon. In pectorals of 26dold pigeons, shivering did not increase linearly during decreasing ambient temperature, as in other muscles and species, but started abruptly, at full intensity. Furthermore, in 24dold pigeons, cooling induced movement activity in legs. The median frequency of shivering EMGs varied (1) with maturation of the muscle, (2) with size of the adult bird, and (3) between altricials and precocials.

10.1086/603634|Lifehistory theory predicts that individuals should adapt their parental investment to the costs and benefits of the current reproductive effort. This could be achieved by modulating the hormonal stress response, which may shift energy investment away from reproduction and redirect it toward survival. In birds, this stress response consists of a release of corticosterone that may be accompanied by a decrease in circulating prolactin, a hormone involved in the regulation of parental care. We lack data on the modulation of the prolactin stress response. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that individuals should modulate their prolactin stress response according to the fitness value of the current reproductive effort relative to the fitness value of future reproduction. Specifically, we examined the influence of breeding status (failed breeders vs. incubating birds) and body condition on prolactin and corticosterone stress responses in a longlived species, the snow petrel

In this study, we investigated the relationships among six immune defense indexes commonly used by ecoimmunologists and measured simultaneously in individual free-living tree swallows. Three main axes of variation in immune function were identified using a principal components analysis, representing variation in T-cell, B-cell, and innate immunity. Measures within each axis tended to be positively correlated among individuals, while measures in different axes were uncorrelated. A trade-off between T-cell function and B-cell function became apparent only when variation among individuals in body condition, age, and general quality was taken into account. Interestingly, the level of natural antibodies, a component of innate immunity, showed the strongest association with components of acquired B-cell function, possibly reflecting a common underlying genetic mechanism, as has been documented in poultry. Our results indicate that despite the complexity of the immune system, important insights can be gained by using the currently available assays but in a more comprehensive approach than has generally been used in the field of ecoimmunology.

However, they are also valuable for many physiological functions (e.g., antioxidants, immunostimulants, photoprotection, visual tuning, yolk nourishment to embryos), and as a result they are present in numerous internal body tissues (e.g., liver, adipose tissue, retina) whose carotenoid types and amounts are rarely studied in the context of color acquisition. Because male and female animals typically place different priorities on fitnessenhancing activities (e.g., gametic investment in females, sexual attraction in males), carotenoid allocation may track such investment patterns in the two sexes, and we can test for such sexspecific priorities of carotenoids by assessing bodytissue distributions of these pigments.

10.1086/671165|Many animal populations are in decline as a result of human activity. Conservation practitioners are attempting to prevent further declines and loss of biodiversity as well as to facilitate recovery of endangered species, and they often rely on interdisciplinary approaches to generate conservation solutions. Two recent interfaces in conservation science involve animal behavior (i.e., conservation behavior) and physiology (i.e., conservation physiology). To date, these interfaces have been considered separate entities, but from both pragmatic and biological perspectives, there is merit in better integrating behavior and physiology to address applied conservation problems and to inform resource management. Although there are some institutional, conceptual, methodological, and communication-oriented challenges to integrating behavior and physiology to inform conservation actions, most of these barriers can be overcome. Through outlining several successful examples that integrate these disciplines, we conclude that physiology and behavior can together generate meaningful data to support animal conservation and management actions. Tangentially, applied conservation and management problems can, in turn, also help advance and reinvigorate the fundamental disciplines of animal physiology and behavior by providing advanced natural experiments that challenge traditional frameworks.

In addition, glucocorticoids act directly on the central nervous system and influence behavior, including locomotor activity. To explore potential changes in the HPA axis as animals evolve higher voluntary activity levels, we characterized plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentrations and adrenal mass in four replicate lines of house mice that had been selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running (HR lines) for 34 generations and in four nonselected control (C) lines. We determined CORT concentrations under baseline conditions and immediately after exposure to a novel stressor (40 min of physical restraint) in mice that were housed without access to wheels. Resting daytime CORT concentrations were approximately twice as high in HR as in C mice for both sexes. Physical restraint increased CORT to similar concentrations in HR and C mice; consequently, the proportional response to restraint was smaller in HR than in C animals. Adrenal mass did not significantly differ between HR and C mice. Females had significantly higher baseline and postrestraint CORT concentrations and significantly larger adrenal glands than males in both HR and C lines. Replicate lines showed significant variation in body mass, length, baseline CORT concentrations, and postrestraint CORT concentrations in one or both sexes. Among lines, both body mass and length were significantly negatively correlated with baseline CORT concentrations, suggesting that CORT suppresses growth. Our results suggest that selection for increased locomotor activity has caused correlated changes in the HPA axis, resulting in higher baseline CORT concentrations and, possibly, reduced stress responsiveness and a lower growth rate.

The latter implies that individuals respond in a similar manner to changing seasonal conditions.

10.1086/603635|In response to unbalanced energy budgets, animals must allocate resources among competing physiological systems to maximize fitness. Constraints can be imposed on energy availability or energy expenditure, and adjustments can be made via changes in metabolism or tradeoffs with competing demands such as bodymass maintenance and immune function. This study investigates changes in constitutive immune function and the acutephase response in shorebirds (red knots) faced with limited access time to food. We separated birds into two experimental groups receiving either 6 h or 22 h of food access and measured constitutive immune function. After 3 wk, we induced an acutephase response, and after 1 wk of recovery, we switched the groups to the opposite food treatment and measured constitutive immune function again. We found little effect of food treatment on constitutive immune function, which suggests that even under resource limitation, a baseline level of immune function is maintained. However, birds enduring limited access to food suppressed aspects of the acutephase response (decreased feeding and mass loss) to maintain energy intake, and they downregulated thermoregulatory adjustments to food treatment to maintain body temperature during simulated infection. Thus, under resourcelimited conditions, birds save energy on the most costly aspects of immune defense.

30158028|European hares selectively feed on plants with high fat and hence energy content. We hypothesized that these dietary requirements limit the ability of hares to adjust daily food intake during periods of high energy requirements, namely lactation. Our measurements in captive lactating females show that does kept on a lowfat diet increased food intake compared to does on a highfat diet but assimilated significantly lower amounts of energy. Further, does fed a lowfat diet showed a prolonged rise of food intake during lactation, reduced milk energy content and lower milk mass production at large litter sizes. We hypothesize that impaired milk production under suboptimal fat supply is due to the inability of females to increase the capacity of nutrientprocessing organs rapidly enough to meet the high energy demands of precocial juveniles with high metabolic costs. Thus, in hares, the production of precocial young may be viewed as a constraint, caused by their inability to dig thermally buffered burrows, rather than as an adaptive reproductive strategy. We suggest that the interaction of lactation energetics, dietary requirements, and reduced plant diversity in modern agricultural landscapes has facilitated the decline of hare populations across Europe over the last decades.

Here we review and discuss several key examples of among-population variation in insect thermal performance, including latitudinal gradients in chill coma recovery time, variation in energy consumption and metabolic biochemistry, rapid changes in thermal biology with range expansion in invasive and introduced species, and potential constraints on variation in thermal performance traits. This review highlights that while there is substantial evidence for among-population variation that is generally correlated with local climate regimes, neither the underlying mechanisms nor the implications for whole-animal fitness in the field are well understood. We also discuss the potential limitations of interpreting evolved variation among populations and argue for a genes-to-environment approach to population-level variation in thermal biology of insects.
30162238|Altered body condition, increased incubation costs, and egg loss are important proximate factors modulating bird parental behavior, since they inform the adult about its remaining chances of survival or about the expected current reproductive success. Hormonal changes should reflect internal or external stimuli, since corticosterone levels (inducing nest abandonment) are known to increase while body condition deteriorates, and prolactin levels (stimulating incubation) decrease following egg predation. However, in a capital incubator that based its investment on available body reserves and naturally lost about half of its body mass during incubation, corticosterone should be maintained at a low threshold to avoid protein mobilization for energy supply. This study focused on the regulation of corticosterone and prolactin release in such birds during incubation, when facing egg manipulation (control, reduced, or increased) or a stressful event. Blood samples were taken before and after clutch manipulation and at hatching. Corticosterone levels were determined before and after 30 min of captivity. Female eiders exhibited a high hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal sensitivity, plasma concentration of corticosterone being increased by four to fivefold following 30 min of captivity. The adrenocortical response was not modified by body mass loss but was higher in birds for which clutch size was increased. In the same way, females did not show different prolactin levels among the experimental groups. However, when incubation started, prolactin levels were correlated to body mass, suggesting that nest attendance is programmed in relation to the female initial body condition. Moreover, due to an artifactual impact of bird manipulation, increased baseline corticosterone was associated with a prolactin decrease in the control group. These data suggest that, in eiders, body mass and clutch size modification can modulate prolactin and corticosterone levels, which crossregulate each other in order to finely control incubation behavior.
PBZ10048|Resting metabolic rate is a common way of quantifying the cost of living in endothermic animals. The trait often makes up a substantial part of an animals energy budget and can also be related to sustainable peak work rate as well as to daily energy expenditure.

30161081|On the basis of the comparative approach and three models of metabolism (endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates, body mass, and mammalian development), we suggest that a few common cellular processes, linked either directly or indirectly to membranes, consume the majority of energy used by most organisms; that membranes act as pacemakers of metabolism through changes in lipid composition, altering membrane characteristics and the working environment of membrane proteinsspecifically, that changes in the membrane environment similarly affect the molecular activities (specific rates of activity) of membranebound proteins; and that polyunsaturation of membranes increases whereas monounsaturation decreases the activity of membrane proteins. Experiments designed to test this theory using the sodium pump support this supposition. Potential mechanisms considered include fluidity, electrical fields, and related surface area requirements of lipids. In considering the evolution of endothermy in mammals, for example, if the first mammals were small, possibly nocturnal and active organisms, all these factors would favour increased polyunsaturation of membranes. Such changes (from monounsaturated to polyunsaturated membranes) would allow membranes to set the pace of metabolism in the evolution of endothermy.

Thermogenic capacity incorporates basal metabolic rate (BMR), nonshivering thermogenesis (NST), and shivering thermogenesis (ST). Increasing the capacity of any of these components will result in increased thermogenic capacity. It is often thought that NST should be the most plastic component of thermogenic capacity and as such is the most likely to increase with cold acclimation. We used deer mice to test this hypothesis by acclimating 27 animals to one of two temperatures (5 or 22C) for 8 wk. We then measured and compared values for thermogenic capacityBMR, ST, and NSTbetween the two groups. Thermogenic capacity and NST increased by 21% and 42%, respectively, after cold acclimation. Neither BMR nor ST showed any change after acclimation. Therefore, it appears that deer mice raise their thermogenic capacity in response to prolonged cold by altering NST only.

Despite international agreements to phase out harmful ODSs, these substances are persistent, and even under the most optimistic scenarios, stratospheric ozone levels will not return to pre1980 levels for several decades. Furthermore, climate change may enhance chemical stratospheric ozone depletion. Global phenomena such as climate change, ozone depletion, and acidification of aquatic ecosystems interact to modify dissolved organic carbon levels in aquatic systems, thereby increasing the penetration of UVBR. Since amphibians inhabit both aquatic and terrestrial habitats and have unshelled eggs and permeable skin, they are vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions and habitat quality. Increased exposure of amphibians to UVBR can produce lethal and sublethal effects, especially in individuals that do not possess adequate defense mechanisms to protect themselves. In this article, we discuss worldwide increases in UVBR and the adverse effects of UVBR exposure on amphibians. Specifically, studies on the effects of UVBR on amphibian development and metamorphosis are summarized, and possible mechanisms of thyroid system disruption caused by UVBR exposure are considered.

Hatchlings with greater water contents at hatching were able to survive longer and to lose more water before physiological performance was adversely affected by desiccation.

We studied the role of the shunt in digestion in juvenile American alligators in the following ways. First, we characterized the shunt in fasting and postprandial animals and found that blood was shunted past the lungs during digestion. Second, we disabled the shunt by surgically sealing the left aortic orifice in one group of animals, and we performed a sham surgery in another. We then compared postprandial rates of gastric acid secretion at body temperatures of 19 and 27C and rates of digestion of bone at 27C. Twelve hours after eating, maximal rates of gastric acid secretion when measured at 19 and 27C were significantly less in the disabled group than in shamoperated animals. Twentyfour hours postprandial, a significant decrease was found at 27C but not at 19C. For the first half of digestion, dissolution of cortical bone was significantly slower in the disabled animals. These data suggest the righttoleft shunt serves to retain carbon dioxide in the body so that it can be used by the gastrointestinal system. We hypothesize that the foramen of Panizza functions to enrich with oxygen blood that is destined for the gastrointestinal system to power proton pumps and other energydemanding processes of digestion and that the righttoleft shunt serves to provide carbon dioxide to gastrointestinal organs besides the stomach, such as the pancreas, spleen, upper small intestine, and liver.

30161156|Over the last 50 yr, thermal biology has shifted from a largely physiological science to a more integrated science of behavior, physiology, ecology, and evolution. Today, the mechanisms that underlie responses to environmental temperature are being scrutinized at levels ranging from genes to organisms. From these investigations, a theory of thermal adaptation has emerged that describes the evolution of thermoregulation, thermal sensitivity, and thermal acclimation. We review and integrate current models to form a conceptual model of coadaptation. We argue that major advances will require a quantitative theory of coadaptation that predicts which strategies should evolve in specific thermal environments. Simply combining current models, however, is insufficient to understand the responses of organisms to thermal heterogeneity; a theory of coadaptation must also consider the biotic interactions that influence the net benefits of behavioral and physiological strategies. Such a theory will be challenging to develop because each organisms perception of and response to thermal heterogeneity depends on its size, mobility, and life span. Despite the challenges facing thermal biologists, we have never been more pressed to explain the diversity of strategies that organisms use to cope with thermal heterogeneity and to predict the consequences of thermal change for the diversity of communities.

Feeding studies have shown that 22:1 isomers are predictably underrepresented in adipose tissue relative to diet, implying that metabolism within the predator strongly influences the relationship between the level of these FAs in diet and adipose tissue. Fully understanding such metabolic processes for individual FAs is important for the quantitative estimation of predator diets. We employed a duallabel radioisotope tracer technique to investigate the potential modification of 22:1n11 and its recovery in the blubber of gray seals (

30160104|It had been suggested that the activity of anaerobic enzymes in the white muscle of fish increases exponentially with body size to meet the increasing hydrodynamic costs of burst swimming. We tested whether this relationship holds across a very large size range of striped bass, spanning a nearly 3,000fold range in body mass. We examined the scaling of marker enzymes of anaerobic (lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase) and aerobic (citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase) metabolism in the red and white locomotor muscles. In white muscle, we found positive scaling of anaerobic enzymes only in smaller fishes. Positive scaling of anaerobic enzymes was not found among the samples that included fishes >1,000 g despite having a sufficiently large sample size to detect such scaling. The absence of positive scaling in the white muscles of large bass suggests that they are unable to generate sufficient power to sustain relative burst swimming performance. Enzymes from aerobic pathways had activities that were mass independent in both red and white muscle. Red and white muscles were metabolically distinct except among the smallest fishes. Among young of the year, the anaerobic capacity of red muscle approached that of white muscle and also showed positive scaling. This unusual pattern suggests that red muscle might augment white muscle during burst swimming and add to the total power generated by these small fish. Maximizing burst swimming performance may be critical for small fishes vulnerable to predation but unimportant for large fishes.
30160632|Several species of freshwater turtles in the family Emydidae undergo an ontogenetic dietary shift; as juvenile turtles mature, they change from a primarily carnivorous to a primarily herbivorous diet. It has been hypothesized that this shift results from an unfavorable ratio of gut capacity to metabolic rate that prevents small reptiles from processing adequate volumes of plant material to meet their energetic demands. Effects of dietary dilution on intake were evaluated in two size classes of redeared sliders (
30158080|Siberian hamsters as young as 16 and 28 d displayed torpor in response to treatment with 2,500 mg/kg 2deoxyDglucose and reduced food availability, respectively. In addition, most foodrestricted hamsters displayed increased locomotor activity and elevated body temperatures in the 3 h immediately preceding daily food delivery. This anticipatory activity disappeared within a few days of reimposition of ad lib. feeding. Torpor first appeared spontaneously at 13 wk of age in hamsters fed ad lib. and maintained in short day lengths. The onset of this spontaneous torpor was unaffected by the hamsters history of food restriction before age 2 mo. Siberian hamsters born late in the breeding season can conserve energy by undergoing torpor immediately after weaning when they contend with food shortages and concurrent energetic challenges imposed by growth requirements and low ambient temperatures.

30158124|Studies of basal metabolic rate (BMR), the minimum metabolic rate of postabsorptive, inactive endotherms while in their rest phase and thermal neutral zone, have contributed significantly to our understanding of animal energetics. Besides body mass, the main determinant of BMR, researchers have invoked diet and phylogenetic history as important factors that influence BMR, although their relative importance has been controversial. For 58 species within the Carnivora, we tested the hypothesis that BMR is correlated with home range size, a proxy for level of activity, and diet, using conventional least squares regression (CLSR) and regression based on phylogenetic independent contrasts (PIC). Results showed that BMR of Carnivora was positively correlated with home range size after controlling for body mass, regardless of the statistical method employed. We also found that diet and massadjusted home range size were correlated. When we simultaneously tested the effect of diet and massadjusted home range on massadjusted BMR, home range size was insignificant because of its colinearity with diet. Then we eliminated home range size from our model, and diet proved to be significant with both CLSR and PIC. We concluded that species that eat meat have larger home ranges and higher BMR than species that eat vegetable matter. To advance our understanding of the potential mechanisms that might explain our results, we propose the muscle performance hypothesis, which suggests that selection for different muscle fiber types can account for the differences in BMR observed between meat eaters and vegetarian species within the Carnivora.
30160047|Evolutionary hypotheses suggest that higher rates of postembryonic development in birds should either lower the resting metabolic rate (RMR) in a tradeoff between the costs of growth and maintenance or increase RMR because of a buildup of metabolic machinery. Furthermore, some suggest that higher rates of postembryonic development in birds should reduce peak metabolic rate (PMR) through delayed tissue maturation and/or an increased energy allocation to organ growth. We studied this by comparing metabolic rates and organ sizes of fastgrowing meattype chickens (broilers) with those of birds from a laying strain, which grow much slower. During the first week of life, despite growing six times faster, the RMR of the broiler chickens was lower than that of birds of the laying strain. The difference between strains in RMR disappeared thereafter, even though broilers continued to grow twice as fast as layers. The differences between strains in growth rate during the first week after hatching were not reflected in similar differences in the relative masses of the heart, liver, and small intestine. However, broilers had heavier intestines once they reached a body mass of 80 g. In contrast, broilers had relatively smaller brains than did layers. There was a positive correlation, over both strains, between RMR and the masses of leg muscles, intestine, and liver. Furthermore, despite delayed maturation of muscle tissue, broilers exhibited significantly higher PMR. We hypothesize that a balance between the larger relative muscle mass but lower muscle maturation level explains this high PMR. Another correlation, between leg muscle mass and PMR, partly explained the positive correlation between RMR and PMR.

Embryonic development arrests due to hypoxia (low oxygen) in the maternal oviducts and resumes only after exposure to normoxia when eggs are laid. Recently, several studies have hypothesized that the prolonged periods of preovipositional arrest may have a detrimental effect on embryo survival and development after eggs are laid. We tested this hypothesis by comparing embryo survival (determined by white spot formation and hatching success) and hatchling fitness (measured by self-righting, crawling, and swimming ability) of flatback sea turtle (

30158691|Watersoluble nutrients can be absorbed across the intestinal epithelium by transcellular and paracellular processes. Recent studies suggest that small birds (<180 g) have more extensive paracellular absorption of glucose than nonflying mammals. This may be a feature that compensates for a reduced small intestine size because small birds have smaller masscorrected intestinal length than do nonflying mammals, but the difference diminishes in larger birds. We hypothesized that if this explanation were correct, there would be a negative correlation between paracellular absorption and body mass in birds and that larger birds would have paracellular absorption comparable to that of nonflying mammals. We tested this hypothesis, using consistent methodology, by measuring the extent of absorption of a series of inert carbohydrate probes in heavier bird species (>300 g) selected from diverse taxa: American coots, mallards, pheasants, and pigeons. Absorption of carbohydrate probes was inversely related to body mass in birds, and absorption of these probes in large birds (>500 g) was comparable to absorption measurements in nonflying mammals. Higher paracellular uptake in the smaller avian species may offer a physiologically inexpensive means of nutrient absorption to compensate for a reduced small intestine size but may make those species more vulnerable to toxicant absorption.
10.1086/665275|Studies of locomotor performance often link variation in morphology with ecology. While maximum sprint speed is a commonly used performance variable, the absolute limits for this performance trait are not completely understood. Absolute maximal speed has often been shown to increase linearly with body size, but several comparative studies covering a large range of body sizes suggest that maximal speed does not increase indefinitely with body mass but rather reaches an optimum after which speed declines. Because of the comparative nature of these studies, it is difficult to determine whether this decrease is due to biomechanical constraints on maximal speed or is a consequence of phylogenetic inertia or perhaps relaxed selection for lower maximal speed at large body size. To explore this issue, we have examined intraspecific variations in morphology, maximal sprint speed, and kinematics for the yellow-spotted monitor lizard

30162156|Most cells are bathed by interstitial fluid, but extracellular pH measurements are mostly for arterial plasma. Wholebody mean pH differences between the two fluids have been estimated in terms of a simple model. This relates to the diffusive exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen and utilizes literature data, for 22 vertebrate species, on arterial and mixedvenous tensions of both gases. Uncertainties arise because the carbon dioxide reaction in blood may sometimes be in disequilibrium and because carbon dioxide diffusion is facilitated to unknown degrees in the presence of buffers. Nevertheless, the model suggests that the pH difference should tend to vary inversely with arterial carbon dioxide tension. In some species, this may aid interstitial pH homeostasis, but a clearer implication is that the difference should be generally greater in water breathers than in air breathers. It has previously been found that arterial pH in waterbreathing teleosts also tends to be higher than in airbreathing tetrapods (when allowance is made for temperature and plasma sodium concentration) and to a comparable extent. Thus, mean interstitial pH may be more nearly similar in the two groups than is arterial pH. Direct measurements of interstitial pH do not yet suffice to test the model.
30161161|Chemical communication is virtually universal among terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Chemical signals control the interactions of cells and organs (hormones) as well as the intra (pheromones) and interspecific (allelochemicals) relationships between animals.

Knowledge of the function of these systems and of the molecular structures of the chemical compounds involved may provide the basis for highly selective techniques of pest control.

30161046|Secretion of the steroid hormone corticosterone (CORT) in response to perturbations results in behavior patterns that can maximize survival. Three commonly cited hypotheses suggest that during breeding, there are advantages associated with suppressed (CORT) secretion in (1) the sex that is most important for parental care, (2) individuals in good body condition, and (3) species with a short breeding season and limited renesting opportunities. We addressed these hypotheses in two midlatitude breeders, chestnutcollared and McCowns longspurs, by assessing CORT secretion over a 1h period of handling. These species have congeners that are exclusively arctic breeders, and this provides a unique opportunity to assess adrenocortical responsiveness both within a phylogenetic framework and across environmental variables. In both species, males and females showed similar CORT secretion patterns in response to handling, and body condition was unrelated to CORT secretion. Additionally, although these midlatitude breeders have more opportunities to attempt a renest than their arctic congeners, their hormonal response to stress was similar to that reported for their arctic congeners. We suggest that an attenuated stress response may relate to the severity of the breeding environment and a low likelihood of successful renesting, since these variables are common to both arctic and grassland habitats.

30158398|Skin is an important avenue of water loss in terrestrial birds, so environmental conditions that necessitate water conservation should favor physiological mechanisms that reduce cutaneous water loss (CWL). Skin resistance to CWL is conferred by a barrier of lipid molecules located in the stratum corneum (SC), the outer layer of the epidermis. In mammals, SC barrier function depends on the conversion of cerebrosides to ceramides by the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GlcCerase). Avian SC contains both cerebrosides and ceramides, suggesting that observed plasticity in CWL may be mediated by changes in GlcCerase activity and resultant SC lipid composition. We tested the hypothesis that changes in ambient humidity would alter GlcCerase activity by acclimating house sparrows (
30158065|Two competing but nonexclusive hypotheses to explain the reduced basal metabolic rate (BMR) of mammals that live and forage underground (fossorial species) are examined by comparing this group with burrowing mammals that forage on the surface (semifossorial species). These hypotheses suggest that the low BMR of fossorial species either compensates for the enormous energetic demands of subterranean foraging (the costofburrowing hypothesis) or prevents overheating in closed burrow systems (the thermalstress hypothesis). Because phylogentically informed allometric analysis showed that arid burrowing mammals have a significantly lower BMR than mesic ones, fossorial and semifossorial species were compared within these groups. The BMRs of mesic fossorial and semifossorial mammals could not be reliably distinguished, nor could the BMRs of large (>77 g) arid fossorial and semifossorial mammals. This finding favours the thermalstress hypothesis, because the groups appear to have similar BMRs despite differences in foraging costs. However, in support of the costofburrowing hypothesis, small (<77 g) arid fossorial mammals were found to have a significantly lower BMR than semifossorial mammals of the similar size. Given the high massspecific metabolic rates of small animals, they are expected to be under severe energy and water stress in arid environments. Under such conditions, the greatly reduced BMR of small fossorial species may compensate for the enormous energetic demands of subterranean foraging.

30161053|Amphibians are a vertebrate group transitional between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Consequently, both increases and decreases in blood volume are a natural biological stress associated with aquatic and terrestrial environments. In comparison with other vertebrate classes, anuran amphibians have the most rapid compensation and greatest capacity to compensate for changes in blood volume and survive dehydration. Unlike in mammals, a Starling transcapillary uptake mechanism does not account for this fluid mobilization because lymph flow is a substantial and important additional factor. The role of the lymphatic system in flux of fluids back into the circulation varies interspecifically in anurans and is an order of magnitude greater in anurans than in mammals. Current models of lymph movement in anurans are centered on the role of lymph hearts, but we suggest that these models are untenable. We present a new hypothesis for lymph movement involving (1) pressure differences created by compartmentalization of the hind limb lymph spaces into sacs of serially graded compliance to move lymph horizontally and (2) both negative and positive pressure differences created by contraction of skeletal muscles to move lymph vertically. The primary function of some of these skeletal muscles may be solely for lymph movement, but some may also be involved with other functions such as pulmonary ventilation.
10.1086/597548|Basal metabolic rate (BMR) in animals is interpreted as reflecting the size and metabolic intensity of energyconsuming tissues. However, studies investigating relationships between the mass of specific organs and interindividual variation in BMR have produced inconsistent patterns with regard to which organs have the largest impact on BMR variation. Because of the known flexibility in organ mass and metabolic intensity within individual organs, relationships between BMR and bodycomposition variables are bound to be context specific. Altricial nestlings are excellent models to illustrate this phenomenon because of the extreme variation in body composition occurring during growth. Using European starlings at three age classes, we studied changes in body composition together with its effect on variation in resting metabolic rate (RMR) in order to highlight the contextspecific nature of these relationships. Our data suggest a transition in metabolic costs during growth in starling nestlings. During the linear phase of growth, energy is mainly consumed by tissuesynthesis processes, with fastgrowing organs having a large influence on RMR. In the plateau phase of growth, the energy expenditure is transferred to functional costs, with highintensity organs having a predominant effect on RMR variation. Our data illustrates the contextspecific nature of organ massmetabolic rate correlations, which complicates inter and intraspecific comparisons of BMR. In the future, such comparisons must be done while taking the physiological state of the study animal into account.
30158372|Given the importance of heat in most biological processes, studies on thermoregulation have played a major role in understanding the ecology of ectothermic vertebrates. It is, however, difficult to assess whether body temperature is actually regulated, and several techniques have been developed that allow an objective assessment of thermoregulation. Almost all recent studies on reptiles follow a single methodology that, when used correctly, facilitates comparisons between species, climates, and so on. However, the use of operative temperatures in this methodology assumes zero heat capacity of the study animals and is, therefore, appropriate for small animals only. Operative temperatures represent potentially available body temperatures accurately for small animals but can substantially overestimate the ranges of body temperature available to larger animals whose slower rates of heating and cooling mean that they cannot reach equilibrium if they encounter operative temperatures that change rapidly through either space or time. This error may lead to serious misinterpretations of field data. We derive correction factors specific for body mass and rate of movement that can be used to estimate body temperature null distributions of larger reptiles, thereby overcoming this methodological problem.

10.1086/673889|Caudal autotomythe ability to self-detach the tailis a dramatic adaptation common to many structural-grade lizards. For most species, tail loss is followed by the equally dramatic phenomenon of tail regeneration. Here we review the anatomy and histology of caudal autotomy and regeneration in lizards, drawing heavily from research published over the past 2 decades. The autotomous tail is characterized by various structural adaptations, which act to minimize blood loss and trauma to adjacent tissues. The early phase of wound healing involves a leukocytic response but limited inflammation. Reepithelialization via a specialized wound epithelium is not only critical for scar-free healing but also necessary for subsequent tissue patterning and regenerative outgrowth. Regeneration begins with the formation of the blastema, a mass of proliferating mesenchymal-like cells. As the blastema expands, it is invaded by blood vessels and the spinal cord. Whereas the replacement tail outwardly resembles the original appendage, it differs in several notable respects, including the tissue composition and organization of the skeleton, muscular system, and spinal cord. Increasingly, the lizard tail is being recognized among biomedical scientists as an important model for the study of wound healing and multitissue restoration.
10.1086/680599|Multiple components of the immune system are modulated by environmental factors, including exposure to stressors.

We determined the long-term effects of exposure to early-life stressors on immunity in song sparrows including the swelling response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and several measures of constitutive innate immunity. Song sparrows were reared in captivity from 3 d of age and exposed to control conditions, food restriction, or corticosterone (CORT) treatment. Males exposed to food restriction or CORT treatment had less swelling of the wing web in response to PHA than control males; however, neither treatment affected the swelling response to PHA in females.

In addition, these species live at higher altitudes, which may also decrease metabolic acclimatization found in birds. Winter birds tolerated colder test temperatures than summer birds. This improved cold tolerance was associated with an increase in maximal thermogenic capacity or summit metabolism (

10.1086/673864|Caudal autotomy is a common defense mechanism in lizards, where the animal may lose part or all of its tail to escape entrapment. Lizards show an immense variety in the degree of investment in a tail (i.e., length) across species, with tails of some species up to three or four times body length (snout-vent length [SVL]). Additionally, body size and form also vary dramatically, including variation in leg development and robustness and length of the body and tail. Autotomy is therefore likely to have fundamentally different effects on the overall body form and function in different species, which may be reflected directly in the incidence of lost/regenerating tails within populations or, over a longer period, in terms of relative tail length for different species. We recorded data (literature, museum specimens, field data) for relative tail length (
10.1086/605612|Strict criteria have been established for measurement of basal metabolic rate and standard evaporative water loss to ensure that data can be compared intra and interspecifically. However, datasampling regimes vary, from essentially continuous sampling to interrupted (switching) systems with data recorded periodically at more widely spaced intervals. Here we compare one continuous and three interrupted sampling regimes to determine whether sampling regime has a significant effect on estimation of basal metabolic rate or standard evaporative water loss. Compared to continuous 20s sampling averaged over 20 min, sampling every 6 min and averaging over 60 min overestimated basal metabolic rate and evaporative water loss, sampling every 3 min and averaging over 21 min underestimated basal metabolic rate, and sampling every 12 min and averaging over 36 min showed no difference in estimates. Increasing the period over which the minimum mean was calculated significantly increased estimates of physiological variables. Reducing the frequency of sampling from 20 s to a longer interval of 3, 6, or 12 min underestimated basal metabolic rate but not evaporative water loss. This indicates that sampling frequency per se influences estimates of basal metabolic rate and that differences are not just an artifact of differences in the period over which the mean is calculated. Sampling regime can have a highly significant influence on estimation of standard physiological variables, although the actual differences between sampling regimes were generally small (usually <5%). Although continuous sampling is the preferred sampling regime for openflow respirometry studies, if time and cost are prohibitive, then use of an appropriate switching system will result in smaller errors than measuring individuals continuously for shorter periods.

Only a few studies, however, have examined the effects of yolk testosterone (T) on the growth and development of nestlings, and none have reported on the immunological effects of yolk T nor have they examined several different effects in the same nestlings. To examine the effects of yolk T on nestling eastern bluebirds, we administered two doses of exogenous T to bluebird eggs and measured the growth and immunological responsiveness in the resulting nestlings. We found that yolk T is detrimental to developing embryos, with hatching success decreasing with increasing doses of yolk T. Moderate doses of yolk T stimulated skeletal growth during the embryonic period, while high doses of yolk T resulted in nestlings that weighed more and were more mature at fledging but had a compromised Tcell immune response to phytohemagglutinin. These data suggest that the alteration of reproductive success through the allocation of yolk T is a complicated phenomenon that involves the integration of several physiological effects.

State 3 respiration rate measured at 37C was 20%30% lower in euthermic fasted animals when glutamate but not succinate was used as a substrate.

30161307|Comparative physiology has traditionally focused on the physiological responses of animals to their physicochemical environment. In recent years, awareness has increased among physiologists of the potential for behavioural factors, such as the social environment of the animal, to affect physiological condition and responses. This recognition has led to an emerging trend within the field toward using multidisciplinary approaches that incorporate both behavioural and physiological techniques. Research areas in which the integrated study of behaviour and physiology has been particularly fruitful include the physiology of the social environment, sensory physiology and behaviour, and physiological constraints on behavioural ecology. The manner in which incorporating behavioural considerations has informed the physiological data collected is discussed for each of these areas using specific examples.
10.1086/665276|Mammalian immunology has been studied in great detail in laboratory animals, but few of the tools and less of the insight derived from these studies have been placed in the context of natural, outbred wildlife populations subject to variable environments. We investigated patterns of innate immunity in free-ranging African buffalo in relation to host traits (age, reproductive status, body condition, white blood cell counts) and disease status (bovine tuberculosis [BTB], gastrointestinal nematodes, coccidia, ticks). We evaluated and used an in vitro assay measuring bactericidal competence of blood to assess a component of innate immunity in 200 female buffalo captured at Kruger National Park, South Africa, in June/July and October 2008. Animals with BTB had higher bactericidal competence of blood. Animals with higher neutrophil counts had higher bactericidal competence, whereas animals with lower lymphocyte counts had higher bactericidal competence. This pattern was driven by animals captured at the end of the dry season (October) and may be evidence of immune polarization, whereby individuals are unable to upregulate multiple components of immunity simultaneously. Bactericidal competence did not vary with host pregnancy status, body condition, age, lactation, tick infestation, nematode egg count, or coccidia oocyst count. Overall, we demonstrate that the bactericidal competence assay is practical and informative for field-based studies in wild bovids. Our results also show a correlation between bactericidal competence and bovine tuberculosis infection and reveal possible functional polarizations between different types of immune response in a free-ranging mammal.
10.1086/605915|In most male birds that exhibit paternal care, elevation in testosterone above the breeding baseline reduces nestling provisioning, which can be detrimental to offspring survival. Mechanisms that may allow some males to avoid this detrimental effect of elevated testosterone include (1) decreased sensitivity to testosterones effects on behavior and (2) uncoupling of testosterone secretion from territorial challenges (thus reducing the number of transient elevations in testosterone above the breeding baseline). Both of these costavoidance mechanisms have been documented, but whether selection for these mechanisms is correlated or independent is unknown. We investigated the relationship between elevated testosterone and paternal care in a tropical bird, the rufouscollared sparrow (

Two UCP1 homologues, UCP2 and UCP3, were recently discovered, but it is controversial whether they also play a role in energy homeostasis. Djungarian hamster UCPs were found to exhibit high similarity with homologues known in other species. UCP1 mRNA was restricted to BAT, UCP2 mRNA was expressed in multiple tissues, and UCP3 mRNA was detected mainly in BAT and skeletal muscles. We examined the coldinduced regulation of hamster UCP mRNA levels and tested their correlation with serum free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. In BAT UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 expression was upregulated in the cold, but the increase and time course of increase differed. In skeletal muscle, UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA levels were not altered. Coldinduced changes of serum FFA levels correlated with the stimulation of UCP1 mRNA in BAT but not with UCP2 and UCP3.

One of the most inclusive and yet debatable hypotheses is the one that associates BMR with food habits, including habitat productivity. These effects have been widely investigated at the interspecific level under the assumption that for any given species all traits are fixed. Consequently, the variation among individuals is largely ignored. Intraspecific analysis of physiological traits has the potential to compensate for many of the pitfalls associated with interspecific analyses and, thus, to be a useful approach for evaluating hypotheses regarding metabolic adaptation. In this study, we investigated the effects of food quality, availability, and predictability on the BMR of the leafeared mouse

The effects of early oxygen environment, later oxygen environment, and genotype were then assessed with respect to zebra fish behavior, size, and blood glucose. Fish were tested in an arena where they could shoal with conspecifics before, during, and after the introduction of a novel stimulus. Blood glucose and size were also measured. Early oxygen environment influenced fish size, time spent swimming, and reactivity to a novel stimulus.

30160089|The world's oceans are threedimensional habitats that support high diversity and biomass. Because the densities of most of the constituents of life are greater than that of seawater, planktonic and pelagic organisms had to evolve a host of mechanisms to occupy the third dimension. Some microscopic organisms survive at the surface by dividing rapidly in vertically well mixed zones, but most organisms, small and large, have antisinking strategies and structures that maintain vertical position and mobility. All of these mechanisms have energetic costs, ranging from the foregone metabolic benefits and increased drag of storing highenergy, lowdensity lipids to direct energy consumption for dynamic lift. Defining the niches in the mesopelagic zone, understanding evolution, and applying such ecological concepts as optimal foraging require good estimates of these costs. The extreme cases above are reasonably well quantified in fishes, but the energetic costs of dynamic physiological mechanisms like swim bladders are not; nor are the costs of maintaining vertical position for the chief invertebrate competitors, the cephalopods.

Those line types differ genetically with respect to BMR and to the mass of metabolically expensive internal organs, which are larger in H-BMR mice. In mice of both line types, DR resulted in a significant reduction of body mass, an immune response, and the downsizing of spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, heart, and kidneys but not small intestines. DR resulted in a greater reduction of the spleen and lymph nodes in mice of the H-BMR line type, whereas the thymus was more affected in L-BMR line type. In contrast, immunization resulted in an increase of liver mass in DR mice of both line types. A comparison of the results of current and earlier studies on the same mouse line types suggests that metabolic trade-offs involving the costs of an immune response are more apparent when animals are forced to increase energy demands (e.g., by cold exposure) compared to when energy demands are decreased through DR. Our findings also suggest that divelrgent selection on BMR resulted in between-line-type differences in T-cell- and B-cell-mediated types of an immune response. More generally, our results indicate that production of a wide repertoire of antibodies is not correlated with high BMR.
10.1086/673890|The effect of tail autotomy on locomotor performance has been studied in a number of lizard species. Most of these studies (65%) show that tail autotomy has a negative effect on sprint speed, some studies (26%) show no effect of autotomy on sprint speed, and a few (9%) show a positive effect of autotomy on sprint speed. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the variation across these studies, but none has been tested. We synthesize these data using meta-analysis and then test whether any of four variables explain the variation in how tail autotomy impacts sprint speed: (1) differences in methodology in previous studies, (2) phylogeny, (3) relative tail size, and (4) habitat use. We find little evidence that methodology or habitat use influences how sprint speed changes following tail autotomy. Although the sampling is phylogenetically sparse, phylogeny appears to play a role, with skinks and iguanids showing fairly consistent decreases in speeds after autotomy and with lacertids and geckos showing large variation in how autotomy impacts speed.

Nevertheless, a variety of attributes of these taxa can be inferred by identification of shared anatomical structures whose presence is causally linked to specialized functions in living reptiles, birds, and mammals. Studies such as these demonstrate that although dinosaurs and early birds were likely to have been homeothermic, the absence of nasal respiratory turbinates in these animals indicates that they were likely to have maintained reptilelike (ectothermic) metabolic rates during periods of rest or routine activity. Nevertheless, given the metabolic capacities of some extant reptiles during periods of elevated activity, early birds were probably capable of powered flight.

Life-history theory predicts that short-lived species should devote more resources toward a reproductive event because brood value is far greater compared with that of long-lived species that have multiple breeding opportunities. Previous bird studies have used patterns of hormone secretion to understand the regulation of parental investment in response to environmental challenges, such as stress. The two key hormones investigated have been prolactin, which promotes parental investment, and corticosterone, which can reduce parental investment. Research on long-lived seabirds showed that prolactin levels decrease in response to a stressor, but the magnitude of the decline was positively correlated with future reproductive potential. However, little is known about the role of prolactin in short-lived species.

30158718|The objective of this study was to compare the capacity of adult (more than 3 yr old) and young (less than 1 yr old) true parrots to digest seeds that are normally included in their diet in captivity, particularly soybean, sunflower, and corn. All the seeds were offered for 5 d with an interval of 15 d between different diets. The seeds of soybean and corn were boiled for 15 min and soaked in water at ambient temperature for 12 h before being fed to the birds. There were no differences in the digestibilities of crude protein and fats (ether extract) among animals, but the digestibilities of dry matter and crude fiber by the adult animals were higher than those of the young ones. The digestibility of carbohydrate (nitrogenfree extract) by adult birds was higher only for sunflower seeds. It is concluded that the capacity of parrots to digest fiber may change according to the age of the animal. Since the digestion of fiber depends on the action of microorganisms, these results suggest that the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract is delayed or very slow in young parrots.

Migrating western sandpipers were sampled in spring and fall while refueling at a north temperate stopover and were compared with nonmigrating birds captured at a tropical wintering area in Panama. Sandpipers weighed 25% more at stopover, and nearly 40% of migratory mass increase consisted of lean body components. Most organs and flight muscles were 10%100% larger during migration, and the greatest relative size increases occurred in the digestive system (including liver). Birds preparing to initiate spring migration from Panama deposited only fat, suggesting that changes in lean body components take place after migration has begun, possibly through training effects. Sex did not influence body composition. Juveniles making their first southward migration were similar to adults in structural size and body mass but had substantially enlarged alimentary tracts. Sandpipers appeared to deposit lean mass during stopover in fall but not in spring. The dramatic enlargement of the digestive system in this small species that makes short flights and fuels frequently contrasts with the reduction of digestive components in larger species that fuel only once or twice by making one or two very long flights to their destination.

30161085|Avian and mammalian endothermy results from elevated rates of resting, or routine, metabolism and enables these animals to maintain high and stable body temperatures in the face of variable ambient temperatures. Endothermy is also associated with enhanced stamina and elevated capacity for aerobic metabolism during periods of prolonged activity. These attributes of birds and mammals have greatly contributed to their widespread distribution and ecological success. Unfortunately, since few anatomical/physiological attributes linked to endothermy are preserved in fossils, the origin of endothermy among the ancestors of mammals and birds has long remained obscure. Two recent approaches provide new insight into the metabolic physiology of extinct forms. One addresses chronic (resting) metabolic rates and emphasizes the presence of nasal respiratory turbinates in virtually all extant endotherms. These structures are associated with recovery of respiratory heat and moisture in animals with high resting metabolic rates. The fossil record of nonmammalian synapsids suggests that at least two Late Permian lineages possessed incipient respiratory turbinates. In contrast, these structures appear to have been absent in dinosaurs and nonornithurine birds. Instead, nasal morphology suggests that in the avian lineage, respiratory turbinates first appeared in Cretaceous ornithurines. The other approach addresses the capacity for maximal aerobic activity and examines lung structure and ventilatory mechanisms. There is no positive evidence to support the reconstruction of a derived, avianlike parabronchial lung/air sac system in dinosaurs or nonornithurine birds. Dinosaur lungs were likely heterogenous, multicameral septate lungs with conventional, tidal ventilation, although evidence from some theropods suggests that at least this group may have had a hepatic piston mechanism of supplementary lung ventilation. This suggests that dinosaurs and nonornithurine birds generally lacked the capacity for high, avianlike levels of sustained activity, although the aerobic capacity of theropods may have exceeded that of extant ectotherms. The avian parabronchial lung/air sac system appears to be an attribute limited to ornithurine birds.

However, the diffusion of oxygen through polystyrene needs to be taken into consideration. Here we provide an equation that accounts for the empirically determined rate of oxygen through a polystyrene well when calculating the instantaneous rate of oxygen consumption. Furthermore, we describe a novel method of calibrating a small respirometer for accuracy using micro-osmotic pumps containing an oxygen scavenger, which is delivered at a constant rate and therefore yields a constant rate of oxygen consumption in an airtight system.

These adaptations are mediated by gene-regulatory networks that, despite their inherent complexity, must remain evolvable and capable of responding to different selection pressures associated with specific ecological niches. Phosphorylation events catalyzed by cell-signaling enzymes represent a parsimonious mechanism to integrate new functional or regulatory properties into these gene-regulatory networks. In this study, proteins phosphorylated on consensus sequences for protein kinases A, B, and C; cyclin-dependent kinases; and mitogen-activated protein kinases, as well as the abundance of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase (phospho-SAPK/JNK), were quantified in order to ascertain whether phosphorylation events are divergent among native (

30161174|Because the increase in metabolic rate related to locomotor activity places demands on the cardiorespiratory apparatus, it is not surprising that the evolution of breathing and of locomotion are coupled. As the respiratory faculty becomes more refined, increasingly aerobic life strategies can be explored, and this activity is in turn expedited by a higherperformance respiratory apparatus. This apparent leapfrogging of respiratory and locomotor faculties begins in noncraniate chordates and continues in waterbreathing and airbreathing vertebrates. Because both locomotor and cardiorespiratory activities are coordinated in the brain, neurological as well as biochemical coupling is evident. In spite of very different breathing mechanisms in various vertebrate groups, the basic respiratory control mechanisms appear to have been conserved, and respiratorylocomotor coupling is evident in all classes of vertebrates. Hypaxial body wall muscles that were strictly locomotor in fish have respiratory function in amniotes, but some locomotor function remains in all groups.

10.1086/680167|Artificial selection experiments are an effective tool for testing evolutionary hypotheses, because they allow one to separate genetic and environmental variances of the phenotype. However, it is unclear whether trait divergence typically selected early in life persists over an animals life and altered physiological states, such as reproduction. Here we analyzed the long-term consistency of the betweenline type divergence in basal metabolic rate (BMR) selected at 12 wk of age in laboratory mice. We measured BMR in nonreproducing and reproducing females at the age of 22 wk and then at 27 wk of age. Our results show that within both the reproducing group and the control group, the betweenline type separation in BMR is consistently retained over time and reproductive status. Metabolically active internal organs (heart, liver, kidneys, and small intestine) also consistently differed in size between the two line types with no significant long-term effect of reproduction. The observed consistency of the betweenline type divergence in BMR suggests the existence of the persistent effect of the selection on metabolic traits applied early in life. Moreover, BMR variation achieved by means of artificial selection is considerably higher than that found in natural/unmanipulated populations. The latter may therefore be characterized by insufficient variance to statistically resolve correlations involving BMR.

30161149|The articles in this volume are a product of the enthusiasm shown by delegates to meet in a remote corner of southern Africa and to discuss comparative physiology and biochemistry in their wider interpretation and future course. This collection reflects a small but longstanding commitment to fostering the engagement of biological research with African issues and colleagues. Comparative physiology and biochemistry are evolving, but in this we must guard against fractionation of effort and purpose. Increasingly available molecular methods are seductive in encouraging work on model species and in employing these species in place of more appropriate comparative models. Concomitantly, the comparative approach is reaching out beyond the individual organism and organismorganism interactions to establish underlying principles at ecosystem and landscape levels. The integration of molecular methods into comparative studies will require judicious selection and use of such skills if it is to be achieved without abandoning nonmodel species. The physiological and metabolic bases of ecosystem and evolutionary approaches must be underpinned by relevant data, requiring comparative researchers to accommodate colleagues contributing this specialist knowledge. These articles report distinct symposia, prefaced by a plenary paper. While each paper is itself a review of an entire symposium, they all exhibit a common theme, that comparative physiology and biochemistry are about interactions. It is our hope that the Comparative Physiology and Biology in Africa meetings will continue to facilitate special interactions between the people who make this happen.

30158063|The bodysize scaling pattern of enzymes that are important in energy metabolism was examined in gills of the blue crab as a function of acclimation salinity. We hypothesized that the higher surfaceareatovolume ratio of small crabs would impose a greater metabolic cost for hyperosmoregulation, leading to an increase in the capacity for ATP production in gills. Postmetamorphic crabs spanning a 2,500fold range in body mass were examined following a 7d exposure to a salinity of 35, 17, or 5 ppt. The posterior gills, which are the principal site of osmoregulatory ion pumping, generally had higher activities than the anterior gills, which are primarily used for gas exchange, and this discrepancy was greatest in small crabs. A significant effect of salinity was found only for the enzyme citrate synthase, where the activity was highest at the lowest salinity. Although most enzymes scaled negatively with body mass, the activity was independent of size over a 250fold size range that encompassed the body masses of juvenile crabs but decreased abruptly in the adult crabs. These data suggest that ion pumping associated with osmoregulation may represent a greater energetic challenge in smaller crabs, and this is reflected in the relatively higher metabolic potential of the posterior gills. However, acclimation to different salinity regimes does not lead to dramatic global changes in the capacity for energy metabolism.

30158700|A major source of energy during lactation in mammals is provided through the mobilization of blubber fatty acids (FAs). We investigated the extent to which FAs were mobilized to support both maternal metabolic requirements and milk production in the Weddell seal and how this was reflected in the FA composition of the pups blubber at the end of lactation (EL). FA composition of postpartum female blubber was similar in the 2 yr of study (2002 and 2003) but differed markedly by EL. Pup blubber FAs (at EL) were also different between years and did not match that of the mothers milk or blubber. Milk FA composition changed during lactation, which may have been a reflection of an increase in pup energy demands at different stages of development. In addition, there was evidence of feeding by some females during lactation, with higher levels of some FAs in the milk than in the blubber. Our results indicate that differential mobilization of FAs occurred in lactating Weddell seals and that this was related to total body lipid stores at postpartum. Furthermore, growing pups did not store FAs unmodified, providing evidence that selective use does occur and also that using FA composition to elucidate dietary sources may be problematic in growing individuals.

These improvements cease when fish become juveniles, although absolute swimming velocity (m s
30161313|The ability of various vertebrates to perceive visual information in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum (300400 nm) is receiving increasing interest. To date, many of these studies have concentrated on the role of ultraviolet perception in mate choice, yet there are several ways in which the ability to perceive ultraviolet information may affect other behaviours. Until now, it has been widely assumed that colour in the threespined stickleback can be quantified by methods appropriate to the human visual system. However, evidence does exist that suggests that, in some populations, sticklebacks are capable of perceiving ultraviolet wavelengths. Using a behavioural technique, we tested the ability of the stickleback to perceive ultraviolet light under fullspectrum conditions to establish whether such wavelengths are utilised within their normal behavioural repertoire. We tested this ability by assessing whether subjects could locate hidden food in a foraging task where food position was indicated by the position of landmarks. These landmarks differed only in their ultraviolet content, appearing identical when viewed across the human visible region of the spectrum. We found that sticklebacks were able to use ultraviolet perception to locate a foraging patch under fullspectrum conditions.
30161176|The frog, with two distinct ventilatory acts, provides a useful model to investigate the prospective interaction of two oscillators in generating the respiratory rhythm. Building on evidence supporting the existence of separate oscillators generating buccal and lung ventilation, we have attempted to uncouple the two rhythms in the isolated brain stem preparation. Opioid preferentially inhibits the lung rhythm, suggesting an uncoupling of the lung from the buccal oscillator. Reduction of the superfusate chloride concentration alters both the buccal and the lung rhythms. Joint application of opioid and reducedchloride superfusate leads to an increase in the variability of the buccal bursttolung burst intervals. This increase in variability suggests that chloridemediated mechanisms are involved in coupling the buccal oscillator to the lung oscillator. Given the results from these interventions, we propose a simple schematic model of the frog respiratory rhythm generator, outlining the coupling of the lung and buccal oscillators.

30161199|The standard approach to most allometric research is to gather data on a biological function and a measure of body size, convert the data to logarithms, display the new values in a bivariate plot, and then fit a straight line to the transformations by the method of least squares. The slope of the fitted line provides an estimate for the allometric (or scaling) exponent, which often is interpreted in the context of underlying principles of structural and functional design. However, interpretations of this sort are based on the implicit assumption that the original data conform with a power function having an intercept of 0 on a plot with arithmetic coordinates. Whenever this assumption is not satisfied, the resulting estimate for the allometric exponent may be seriously biased and misleading. The problem of identifying an appropriate function is compounded by the logarithmic transformations, which alter the relationship between the original variables and frequently conceal the presence of outliers having an undue influence on properties of the fitted equation, including the estimate for the allometric exponent. Much of the current controversy in allometric research probably can be traced to substantive biases introduced by investigators who followed standard practice. We illustrate such biases with examples taken from the literature and outline a general methodology by which the biases can be minimized in future research.
