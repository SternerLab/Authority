10.2307/3982941|Part One of this interview related the early U.S. Forest Service career of Inman F. "Cap" Eldredge which began in 1905. The final portion of this oral history interview takes the reader deeper into the development of forestry in the South as Mr. Eldredge pursues his Service career, leaves public employment for seven years as forester-manager of the Superior Pine Products Company in Georgia, returns to the Service, and then enters private consulting prior to his retirement. The reader is reminded that this is a consersation and should be read as such. As before, annotating has been held to a minimum in order to accommodate more of the story.
10.2307/3983137|Since leaving the New York State Ranger School in 1916, Joseph E. McCaffrey has seen duty as a logging engineer, sawmill manager, forest land manager and consultant in the United States and abroad. Most of his career, however, has been spent in the South. He went there to run a steam logging show and stayed on to pioneer in forest management practices with International Paper Company. Mr. McCaffrey joined International Paper in 1928; ten years later he became General Superintendent of Wood Procurement for the Company's southern operations. After a tour of duty with the Army Engineers (1942-1946) supplying timber for units in the Pacific, he came back to International Paper as Southern Kraft Division Superintendent at Georgetown, South Carolina. In 1954 he became Assistant General Manager in charge of Woodlands for the Division and Company Vice President, a position he held until his retirement August 15, 1963. As woods boss for the Southern Kraft Division, he was responsible for the management of 4,300,000 acres of Company timberlands and for the annual procurement of more than 5,500,000 cords of pulpwood. Mr. McCaffrey has participated in almost every industry and professional association. He was an organizer of the Fifth World Forestry Congress and a member of the Advisory Committee to the President's Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission. In 1963 he received the distinguished conservation service award of the Wildlife Society. The following interview, made by the Forest History Society's executive director in February 1964, tells part of the story behind these accomplishments. It brings alive the transition from steam logging to intensive forest land management: the most recent and least documented phase of southern forest history.
10.2307/3983197|Reuben B. Robertson is a name well-known and highly respected in the paper and pulp industry. During more than half a century of leadership in the management of The Champion Paper and Fibre Company of Hamilton, Ohio, and as a member of numerous associations of the wood-using industries, Mr. Robertson has played an important role in a segment of our nation's economic history. He was recognized for his outstanding work in developing the economy of the southern states when he was named Man of the South in 1950. A lawyer by training at Yale and the University of Cincinnati, he first became involved in the management of Champion in 1907 and has served that company as both president and chairman of the Board. Now, at 81, he continues to take active part in business affairs and maintains an office in Asheville, N. C. The following oral history interview was made on February 15, 1959, by Elwood R. Maunder, director of the Forest History Society, and Elwood L. Demmon, former president of the Society of American Foresters and retired former head of the Southeast Experiment Station of the United States Forest Service.
10.2307/3983068|Every trade, profession and business has its folklore and its famous tellers of tales. Woodsworkers, foresters and the forest products industries have a rich store tended by able raconteurs. Jim Stevens is one of these. The following oral history interview was made with Mr. Stevens in Seattle, Washington on November 12 and 13, 1957, by Elwood R. Maunder, executive director of the Forest History Society. Recounted here is the story of a Hardshell Baptist boy evangelist who fell among evil companions, was exiled to the sagebrush wilds of Idaho, ran away from the ranch at 15 to make his living in the logging and railroad construction camps of the west. From great deacon-seat veterans such as Keen-Heel Sam Myers young Stevens learns an art; from Boise and Portland public librarians he learns the riches of great poetry and prose. Moving up from muleskinner, Big-Wheel logger, soldier in the AEF, struggling freelance writer, Stevens becomes in the Twenties a successful magazine article writer and the author of a best-seller book of Paul Bunyan stories. Where did the Bunyan lore come from? Was Paul a real person? What persons and events worked to mold the man who became one of the principal collectors, conservers and creators of Paul Bunyan tales? What is his reply to scholarly criticism of his work? That is what this interview is about.
10.2307/3983044|Inman F. Eldredge is what you might call "a forester's forester." Of those whose names stand highest for their impact upon the development of forestry in the South, "Cap" Eldredge is among the leaders. He entered the U. S. Forest Service in 1905, spent seven years as forester-manager of the Superior Pine Products Company in Georgia, returned to the Forest Service to do the Forest Survey of the Southern States, and then did private consulting for twelve years before deciding, as he expresses it, "to let the younger generation take care of the world." This interview, conducted by Elwood R. Maunder, Director of the Forest History Society, was tape-recorded in New Orleans, Louisiana, February 3 and 4, 1959. It is the record of a conversation as it occurred and should be read as such. The excerpts which appear here and which will be included in the next issue of FOREST HISTORY constitute approximately one-third of the complete interview. Annotating has been held to a minimum in order to accommodate more of the text.
10.2307/3982676|Charles S. Cowan has been a leader in forest protection work in the Pacific Northwest for over forty years. He began his career in the British Columbia Forest Service before World War I, and retired last year as manager of the Washington Forest Protection Association. This interview, conducted by Elwood R. Maunder, Director of the Forest History Foundation, was tape-recorded in Seattle, Washington, October 30 and November 2, 1957. It is the record of a conversation as it occurred and should be read as such. The editor regrets the lack of annotation, but has purposely omitted it in order to accommodate a greater portion of the interview. This selection comprises less than a third of the 55-page, indexed interview.
