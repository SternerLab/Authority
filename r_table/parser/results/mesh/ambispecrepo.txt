25099308| During the last few years, the research group on ecological effects of oil pollution in the Baltic Sea at the Swedish Water and Air Pollution Research Laboratory (IVL) has concentrated its efforts on questions concerning the distribution, conversion and persistence of oil in the Baltic ecosystem in order to enable a proper evaluation of the effects of some of the biologically most active compounds in the oil. The different processes that govern the ultimate disappearance of an oil spill in the sea have been summarized in an Odumtype energy-circuit diagram and the relative importance of the different routes will be briefly discussed with respect to some components of the oil. The long term objective of these studies is inter alia to determine what parts of the ecosystem should be most carefully monitored for oil pollution in the future and for what types of oil components. To collect data to fit into the model, both simple laboratory experiments and experiments in large plastic pools have been carried out, as well as analyses of field samples (cf. Rudling). The pools were equipped with a continuous flow of brackish water and contained the main floral and faunal elements of the Baltic littoral zone, forming a balanced model ecosystem. Experiments in these systems have been carried out to determine the rate of microbial decomposition of oil, the redistribution of an oil slick from the water surface into the water mass and the sediment and different effects of oil on the biota. The plastic pools have also been used to develop and test a field method for the assessment of biological effects of an oil spill in the littoral zone of the Baltic. The method includes the use of the quantitative collection of the fauna of single Fucus plants combined with evaluation of the similarity of the faunal communities of oilcontaminated Fucus plants compared to those of reference samples. This is done by means of similarity indices. It has also been shown that it is important not to limit the investigations of direct effects of oil on the Baltic fauna to e.g. acute toxicity tests of adult specimens of fish, because: (a) several species of crustaceans are much more sensitive than fish to oil pollution due to their hydrophobic body surface (b) juvenile stages of e.g. some crustaceans are much more sensitive than adults (c) long term exposure at concentrations that are only a fraction of those provoking acute effects may severely interfere with growth, reproduction etc. (d) organisms living in the free water mass are generally exposed to much lower concentrations of oil than are those living on a solid surface or in the bottom sediment. ///                               ,       ,           .  ,       ,        Odum,              .        ,             .                   ,      (. ).                   ,    .           ,                 .                   .

25099310| The chemical conditions in the Gotland Basin are used as an example for the nutrient changes in the Baltic deep- and surface water from 1967 to 1975. First the stagnation periods and inflows of high saline water are identified by means of salinity changes in the bottom water of the Gotland Deep and the Landsort Deep. Diagrams showing these conditions are shown. Similar diagrams for oxygen and hydrogen sulfide variations are also shown. Three periods with reducing conditions in the bottom water (zero oxygen values and hydrogen sulfide formation) can be recognized, corresponding to the stagnation periods shown in the salinity diagrams. A diagram demonstrating the oxygen changes and the formation of hydrogen sulfide in the Gotland Deep at standard depths is shown. The three stagnation periods with hydrogen sulfide formation can again be seen. Then a diagram showing the accumulation of phosphate in the bottom water during the stagnation periods is shown. The releasing of phosphate from the sediment surface is discussed. A diagram showing the silicate accumulation during the same period gives a similar picture. The relation between the accumulation of silicate and phosphorus is discussed. Ammonia is also accumulated during stagnant conditions. This is shown in the next diagram. The formation of ammonia from organic matter is briefly discussed. The last diagram shows the distribution of nitrate. Here it can be seen that nitrate behaves as oxygen, showing zero values during the stagnation periods. The reasons for this are explained. In connection with the different diagrams the seasonal variations of all the parameters are discussed. ///                    ;      1967  1975 .                     .  ,   .         .

25099597| The methods and means discussed make it possible to prevent pollution of the oceans with oil and oil products by reducing discharges of oil-containing waters from ships into the sea water and eliminating oil products from the water surface. The emulsion technique using ML detergents allows closed-cycle cleaning of tanks. The closed-cycle cleaning is made possible by the capability of the ML detergents to produce unstable emulsions which decompose spontaneously into an oil product and the detergent solution providing for multiple use of the solution. The studies conducted by the Laboratory have demonstrated that the nature and stability of the emulsions formed are effected not only by the composition of the surface-active agents (SAA) but by electrolytes of sea water and by the temperature of the solution, too. The synergetic emulsifying action of solutions of SAA mixtures and of salts of the sea water has been utilized in development of the compounds for cleaning sea tankers. A technique was developed which provides for localizing the oil spills, preventing their spreading and sorbing them from the water surface. In order to collect oil from the localized oil spill it is possible to use polyurethane foam. The Laboratory developed a biologically decomposed, dispersing agent-EPN-5. We determined its physico-chemical properties, the effects of water salinity on the surface activity and the dispersion composition of the emulsions stabilized by EPN-5 solutions in various concentrations. ///                          .             .                   .              -  (),        .                      .  ,        ,        .          .      ,   - -5.   - ,       ,    ,   -5  .

25099580| The results of the author's investigations indicate that the bottom fauna is an effective indicator of the degree of pollution, eutrophication and self-purification of the benthal in the Baltic Sea. The pollution is always accompanied by the impoverishment of the species composition of zoobenthos. Nontoxic organic substances stimulate, but various toxic substances inhibit the quantitative development of the zoobenthos. The detritophagous and sestophagous species play the principal role in the self-purification of the benthal. The investigation of the trophic composition of the biomass of the zoobenthos makes it possible to assess the intensity of the self-purification of the benthal as a whole and of its various niches. In the benthal polluted by organic substances four zones of saprobity are distinguished: polysaprobic, - and -mesosaprobic and oligosaprobic zones. In the determination of saprobity of water organisms one must consider also their frequency, population density and biomass in different pollution zones. Following on from this an original system of indicators of the saprobity for the -mesohaline areas of the benthal of the Baltic Sea has been composed by the author. In recent decades, as a result of the rapid anthropogenic eutrophication, the gas regime in the pseudoabyssal of the Baltic Sea has considerably deteriorated. This has brought about the perishing of the zoobenthos over a large area. In order to slow down the eutrophication it is necessary to reduce the organic pollution load in the Baltic Sea and to restrict the inflow of biogens from rivers. ///    ,      ,     .       .    ,        . -            .                 .  -   4  : , -  -  .               .    ,       -   .    ,    ,       ,       .              .

25099605|An explanation, which includes the depth of the water, sample site, sample material, energy availability, incubation conditions, and the age of the water mass, is given for the apparent discrepancy in the data obtained on the microbiology of the deep-sea. The rate of microbial activity is related to the availability of energy in the system. Low rates of microbial activity in environments lacking sufficient energy helps prevent the depletion of the energy supply needed for all organisms in the deep-sea - especially when the age of the water mass is taken into consideration.
25099526| The process of self-purification of sea water of lignosulphonic compounds proceeds simultaneously in three directions: 1. Destruction by bacterial oxidation of molecularly dissolved, colloidal and dispersional forms of lignosulphonates. 2. Coagulation and subsequent sedimentation of colloidal lignosulphonates. 3. Sorption of lignosulphonates on the suspended sediments of the littoral and on the benthic water-plants. The intensity of the destruction by bacterial oxidation of lignosulphonates depends upon the amount of sewage in the sea water. It also depends on the temperature of the medium and on the total quantity and character of bacteria in it. The intensity of the coagulation of lignosulphonates depends upon the salinity of the water, its viscosity, its temperature and the turbulent diffusion of the water as well as upon its sewage content. The effect of adsorption increases with the increase of phase contact time. Processes of coagulation and sorption of lignosulphonates result in the presence of sulphite lignin in the sediments. The sulphite lignin content varies from 4 to 109 mg per g of organic substance of silt. Besides, the quality of settling lignosulphonates is affected by the depth at which they settle. The data related to the decomposition rate of various lignosulphonic complex forms are given. ///           : 1) -  -,     ; 2)         ; 3)        -        ,            .         ,  ,    ,     .        .                   4  109   1    .             .         .

25099524| The consequences when applying Knudsen's relations on the Baltic are presented as they were formulated by B. Kullenberg who used the concepts of accumulation factor and half life time. A more general approach by B. Kullenberg and also by Stommel and Farmer is mentioned. The work by Soskin is taken up and compared with similar approaches by Jacobsen and Wyrtki. Particular interest is devoted to Soskin's ideas on the influence of long-term variations in the atmospheric circulation on the water exchange. In that connection, some old salinity data series which were recently found and which originated from Swedish light-ships during the period 1880-1922 are presented. The author then presents some of his own work in this field. A subdivision of the Baltic and adjacent seas into some 50 boxes is shown and, further, an attempt is made to determine the steady state concentrations of a release of 10,000 tons of a substance every year. A short review follows of the application to our waters of an advection-diffusion model. Some long-term salinity variations during a 100-year period are shown, then more details are presented for the period 1926-1930, and finally a computation covering a period of a few weeks is given. ///    ,  , , .         . ,           .    ,       .            .            .           ,          1880 - 1922 .         .         50 ,           10000  .           .        100 ,     1926 - 1930 , , ,      .

25099614|The demersal fish fauna of the Florida Gulf of Mexico shelf was sampled at 18 sites (six transects, each sampled at 37, 91 and 183 meter depths) during July, October, and February-March for a total of 54 stations. One trawl and two dredge collections were made at each station. Ichthyofauna data were analyzed for ecological-geographical relationships between sample sites and seasons using taxometric methods. Stations, with regard to geographic position and time, were treated as "OTU's" and compared using species presence/absence data as comparative characters. The phenetic resemblance of the demersal fish fauna of the Florida Gulf shelf indicates that community associations are influenced predominantly by depth and to a lesser extent substrate, latitude and season. This type of analysis appears to be a useful way of examining faunal data for environment impact studies.
25099617|Analyses of pollutants, organochlorine residues and heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Mn, Cd, Pb, Hg) were carried out in deep-sea organisms, Asteridea, Holoturioidea, fishes. Heavy metals content was determined in sediments. Organochlorine residues were detected in all deep-sea organisms. However, the concentrations observed are similar to those for marine organisms from coastal areas. For heavy metals, high concentrations of mercury, up to 7.5 ppm/dry weight and 6.5 ppm are observed in echinoderms and sediment respectively. High concentrations of lead, up to 167 ppm, occur in the gills of fishes. For other metals, the values observed are roughly similar to those from the literature.

25099602| Deep sea sediments contain more Cu, Ni, Ba, B etc., than transport of detrital terrigenous matter (TM) can explain. Longdistance transport in dissolved from is of no importance for many of these elements. Marine biological matter (BM) is enriched in Cu, Ni, Ba, B etc. Conservative mixing models, using BM and TM as inputs show that the compositional variations in pelagic sediments can be explained by these sources. Such mixing models have been used to estimate how the influx of BM and TM have varied with time, and to what extent different elements ares upplied by BM and TM. The results show that in Cenozoic Equatorial Pacific sediments CaCO, opaline silica, B, Ba, and Cu are predominantly biogenous. It is probable that also P and Ni belong to this group of elements, whereas almost all Al, Ti, Zr, V and Mn are delivered by TM or some volcanic processes. The accumulation rates (AR) for the biological constituents reached maxima during the L. Oligocene and the Miocene, and minima during the U. Oligocene and the Pleistocene; some AR from the Oligocene and the Miocene being 3-6 times higher than at present. The accumulation rate patterns for opaline silica, Ba and B co-vary, whereas the AR for CaCO show another time dependance pattern. These AR-patterns are probably partly due to climatic variations. Plankton in Pacific Equatorial waters incorporate much more Cu, Ni, etc., than is required for the particulate transport of these elements to the ocean floor. This suggests that transport in particulate form of BM is an important source of Cu, Ba, B, etc. for the deep sea floor. 
25099590| This report includes the results of simulation of selfpurification processes in sea water. With laboratory modeling the presence of free-radical oxidation in physico-chemical processes of pollution destruction was determined. Its intensity and kinetics depend both on the salinity of the sea water and on the qualitative and quantitative composition of polluting ingredients. Oil, oil-products and detergents are proved to be potential sources of phenol pollution. An empirical model of the oxygen regime of the areas of the sea was suggested. On the basis of the model equations were derived which can be applied to carry out numerical experiments to predict an oxygen regime's response to the pollution of the sea by detergents and oil products. ///           .      -   -    ,          ,         . ,  ,         .       .      ,                  .

25099530| This paper deals with the river discharges of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter to the Baltic Sea from Sweden. The figures presented are based on data collected in 1969. Data from sixteen rivers in northern Sweden give a median concentration of 0.30 mg total N/1 and of 0.020 mg total P/1. For nine rivers in southern Sweden the corresponding concentrations are 0.85 and 0.030 mg/1, respectively. The computed figures for the concentration of organic matter are 10 and 20 mg/1, respectively. The 1969 discharges of total nitrogen and total phosphorus into the Baltic by the Swedish rivers have been determined to 42,000 tons and 2,800 tons, respectively. The Swedish contribution to the load on the Baltic is of the order of 60,000 tons of nitrogen and 7,000 tons of phosphorus including domestic and industrial sources. The discharge of organic matter by the rivers has been computed to 1,500,000 tons. The mean annual yields of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter from Sweden have been calculated to 1.47, 0.09, and 47 kg/ha year, respectively. Existing data show clearly that the present eutrophic state of the Baltic is due, to a large extent, to the activity of man. ///       ,          .     ,   1969 . ,   16   ,    0,30   N/1  0,020   P/1.        0,85  0,030 /1 .       21  40 /1 .  1969              42,000   2,800 .          60,000    700  ,     .       1,500,000 .   ,         1.47, 0.09  47 //.    ,     ,       .

25099579| Free carbon dioxide and other gaseous products of acidic character isolated in the course of the decomposition of the organic matter of bottom sediments promote dissolution of phosphates. As a result, the content of the latter in bottom solutions and in sea silts is dependent upon the concentration of hydrogen ions. The value of actual annual irretrievable transition of phosphorus into bottom of the Gulf of Riga was calculated to be 9,5 per cent against seeming (by balance) phosphorus deposits. Phosphorus recirculation, with an increase in the inflow into the sea or gulf of barely decomposed suspended or colloidal organic matter, has a marked tendency to increase. This factor can predetermine the increase in initial production (of blue-green seaweed) in the Gulf of Riga by 9,5-11 per cent. ///       ,        ,                    .   ,              9,5%   ( )  .  ,               ,     .

25099595| The maintenance of the permissible loads of pollution discharged into the Baltic Sea demands the realization of a complex of water protection measures. The technological principle of a struggle with pollution should serve as a basic directive, e.g. the going over to the closed cycle of water supply connected with maximum utilization of industrial wastes, the waterless technological cycles and other measures permitting the reduction of the amount of wastes discharged into the sewer systems of towns and regions. If necessary the local treatment of wastes should be carried out on the sites of industrial enterprises. The discharge of poison and other harmful substances from the territory of enterprises is out of the question. Waste waters of industrial enterprises must be collected and directed into the town or large regional purification plants from which they will be directed into rivers or the sea. The basic trend in the development of purification plants in the Soviet Union is the biological treatment of sewage (with chemical after-purification). The creating of purification complexes will take place in stages in accordance with the real technical and economic possibilities. The maximum permissible wastes (LPW) criteria are to be worked out, periodically revised and restricted if necessary. The sewage from great towns situated on great rivers will be discharged through them making use of their self-purification ability. If sewage is discharged directly into the sea, deep sea outlets guaranteeing the optimal dilution of sewage should be used. At present in the Soviet Union biological purification plants are in operation in the towns of Narva, Leningrad and Kohtla-Jrve (partially, up to 30 per cent of the total flow). The building of sewer complexes for the towns of Tallinn and Riga is under way. Important work is being carried out to eliminate the discharge of carcinogenous substances, persistent detergents, phenols and petroleum products. Special attention is being given to the prevention of biogenic substances from entering the rivers and sea. Improved agricultural methods and the chemical after-purification of waste waters are being employed. ///    ,    ,      .         , ..          ,      ,           .             .            .             ,        .

25099316| In an in situ investigation the nitrogen release from the sediment was studied during a redox turn-over from oxidizing to reducing conditions. The sediment was a soft bottom. The experiments were performed in closed systems consisting of plexiglass boxes at 10 m water depth. Samples from the water phase were analyzed intermittently on ammonia which is the dominant nitrogen form. The influence on the course of the ammonia release was studied with regard to light, amount of organic matter and temperature. The start of ammonia release is delayed by light because of the photosynthetic activity inside the boxes. The positive effect of organic matter on the ammonia release is apparent only at the beginning of the experiment. The increase in rate and amount of ammonia release is noticed in the system where the contribution of organic matter was highest 25 g m dry weight. The investigation of the temperature effect was in the range of 2-20C. There was no obvious difference in ammonia release between two experimental systems, one kept at a temperature 5C higher than the parallel system during the experiment. The release of ammonia seems to be of pseudo-zero order reaction and the rate constant is k=177.5 g Nl day.k is calculated from an experiment started in May with good supply of utilizable organic matter. The rate constant for ammonia release in experiments started in autumn with already highly decomposed organic matter is about four times lower. The release course is for a natural sediment with no addition of organic matter and temperature. The driving force for the ammonia diffusion in the sediment is the linear gradient in the uppermost 5 cm of the sediment. Below this level there is no distinct gradient in the ammonia concentration of the interstitial water. The diffusion constant for the sediment,
25099608|A single method, the normalized expected species shared measure of similarity or NESS, is used to measure faunal change with depth for gastropods, cumaceans, polychaetes and ophiuroids. The standard errors of NESS estimates are calculated. Each group has a characteristic pattern of zonation on the Gay Head-Bermuda transect, with gastropods and cumaceans having much narrower depth distributions than either polychaetes or ophiuroids. In the polychaetes the higher similarity results from a small proportion of eurybathyal species. The greatest changes in faunal composition occur on the outer margins of the continental shelf at depths of 200 to 300 m and between upper slope and middle slope depths. These discontinuities coincide with the lower limit of the slope water at 200 to 300 m and the lower limits of temperature anomalies resulting from warm core Gulf Stream rings impinging on the bottom at slope depths. Cluster analysis methods tend to divide the samples into discrete groups or zones, even when the faunal similarity between stations appears to be a continuous function of depth. Changes in cumacean species with both depth and distance between ocean basins are compared for Eastern and Western basins of the North Atlantic.
25099333| As a result of discussions during the Second Soviet-Swedish Symposium on the Pollution of the Baltic 1973 an Expert Meeting on Intercalibration of Biological and Chemical Methods was convened at the Ask laboratory in Sweden in June 1974. One section of the meeting was concerned with the methods used for the determination of oil in water and sediments. As the applied methods were of very different character (extraction followed by either infra-red spectroscopy or gravimetry) it was decided to carry out this first intercalibration on the "pollution level" (milligrammes) rather than on the "trace level" (microgrammes). Laboratories from all the Baltic countries participated, except Denmark and the Federal Republic of Germany. All the laboratories but the Soviet one applied variants of the same method, with infra-red spectroscopy for the quantitative measurement. This latter laborarory used the gravimetric technique. The results of the analyses of natural sea-water samples were comparable in the sense that regardless of the varying detection limits of the methods used, the samples did not seem to contain any detectable amounts of oil. From the analyses of water to which oil had been added at a concentration of 0.36 mg/l two laboratories got comparable, but slightly low results. The results of the other laboratories were much too low but fairly comparable. As a result of the analyses of sea-water with oil added in the concentration 1.87 mg/l all but one of the laboratories applying the infra-red technique achieved comparable results, whereas the laboratory using the gravimetric technique obtained much too low results. The analyses of sediments gave worse results. In some case the extreme values from one and the same sample varied with a factor of about 30. Although some of the results obtained were fairly close to the correct values (concerning the analyses of samples with known additions of oil) the material from this part of the intercalibration is too limited and the differences between duplicate analyses too large to make it possible to claim that any results were comparable. The only exception to this was that the Soviet laboratory and one of the Swedish laboratories (IVL) obtained comparable figures from the analyses of a natural polluted sediment. The general conclusion of the intercalibration is that much work needs to be done on the methodological level and that further intercomparisons are needed before comparable results will be reported from different laboratories. ///  ,      -       1973 ,           ,     ()   1974 .        ,        .

The ratio (Cu+Mo)/Zn is shown to be a relevant paleoredox indicator for bottom water and sediment surface. This trace element ratio agrees well with known data on oxygen concentrations and salinity for the bottom water from the same area for the last 50 years.

25099582| The establishment of the regularities of change in the fish stocks and their amplitudes provides one of the fundamental principles underlying the integral model of the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea, with as its final link the economically valuable product-fish. Formation of fish stocks is based on the variations in their replenishment rates, and fishing and natural mortality. The variations in recruitment rates in many fish species, including the Baltic ones, is affected by the conditions of reproduction. While this is so, the decisive factor is still the adaptive relations of a species to the abiotic environment at the early stages of ontogenesis. Therefore, the processes of fish reproduction should be a predominant section of the model. The changes over many years in the stock of cod, sprat, Baltic herring and other species, are linked with the general processes determining the pattern of the Baltic Sea. Their interconnection is realized through trophic levels at early stages of life, feedback processes, O etc. The causes of environmental change may arise out of a change in the general climatic conditions or under the impact of pollutants. The boundary between these two influences must be drawn if the causal processes of the change in stock and their sources are to be understood objectively, in order to develop, subsequently, an integral programme of measures with a view to the reduction or prevention of damage from water pollution. ///                    ,         .        ,    .       ,    ,    .             .         .     , ,         ,    .          ,  , O  .. ,   ,            .        ,      ,          .

25099315| Results of sediment chemical investigations from three representative areas in the Stockholm archipelago with varying pollution and different exposure to wind and sea are presented. Surface sediments from these areas have been analyzed as regards density, dry substance, loss of ignition and contents of carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead. The results indicate that in the vicinity of Stockholm, the pollution is reflected in the contents of carbon, nitrogen, chromium, copper, zinc and lead while the contents of phosphorus, manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel are normal or somewhat lower than normal. The latter fact is probably due to oxygen deficit when several substances are dissolved. Furthermore it is evident that in badly polluted areas, the contents of certain substances in the surface sediment may describe the flow of the sewage. Such currents probably vary both in time and space but the chemical composition of the surface sediment integrates the variations and makes it possible to interpret the net flow. In the area which is most representative of the archipelago, all analyzed parameters are significantly correlated to each other and to the depth of the water (p>0.01). This is probably due to the fact that sorbable substances are sorbed by sorbents and washed down into deeper areas. Organic substances and ferric and manganese hydroxide are regarded as the most important sorbents. On the basis of this knowledge I have suggested a reduction of the volume of analysis. This may be done without losing valuable information. Since the contents of most substances in the sediment are highest in deep areas a great interest should be devoted to these sediments. In order to make statistical comparisons with sediments from a suitable reference area possible, at least five samples should be collected and these should be subjected to as detailed a chemical analysis as possible. In the other stations only a few informative parameters are analyzed. The content of carbon is an informative parameter since the organic substance is very important as regards sorption. It must then be judged from the results whether further efforts of analysis are necessary. By establishing the relations between sorbents and sorbable substances in the sediment from the most representative area and by comparing these results with those from the other representative areas, it has been possible to trace anomalies in these to pollution. Finally a comparison is made between contents of different substances in surface sediments from several Swedish water areas and a regional study of the sorption relations in sediments along the Baltic coast of Sweden. It is established that studies of sorption relations may be a valuable complement to the traditional comparisons of contents especially in areas with low contents of sorbents and sorbable substances but with disturbed sorption relations. ///        ,   -    ,           .       ,  ,      , , , , , , , , , ,   .  ,           , , , ,   ,      , , ,        .  , ,   ,     .  ,  ,                .  , -,    ,    ,               .  ,      ,             ( >0,01). ,    ,            .           .    ,     .        .             ,       .        ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,       .        .     ,           .            .                         ,       . ,                        . ,             ,               .

25099311| In the course of experimental determination of oxygen demand (OD) of the ocean's abyssal waters, the kinetic curves of the given process reflect two stages of oxidation of organic matter (OM). Initially the process develops at a rather high rate ('exponential' phase); and, during the subsequent period the oxidation of the more stable OM fraction, the rate having undergone a decline, changes into a pratically constant value ('linear' phase). A similar picture is observed in the upper layers of oceanic waters where naturally the intensity of this process is much higher. The OD values determined in the abyssal waters in the course of several dozen days of incubation at temperature in situ exceed by many times the annual OD values calculated according to hydrophysical parameters which range from 0.001 to 0.004 ml O/l. In calculating OD according to the content of easily assimilated OM in water established within the vertical distribution of the zooplankton and bacteria, the average OD in the ocean's water masses ranging from 1000 to 4000 m. at temperature in situ equals about 0.003 ml O/l per year. The OD calculations in the deep waters of the Baltic Sea accomplished in a way similar to the ones related to oceans led to the following results: the annual OD in layers from 50 to 75 m, from 75 to 100 m and from 100 to 150 m respectively amount to: 1.53, 1.48 and 0.31 ml O/l per year. The annual OD in the entire layer of the Baltic Sea waters from 50 to 150 m equals 4.4 km O. ///      ()    ,           ().

10.2307/25099572| The results of systematic observations of the state of chemical pollution of the open sea waters and the variations of hydrochemical conditions caused by both pollution and natural reasons, first of all by long-period pulsation in the North Sea waters' inflow, are discussed in the report. The salt and oxygen advection from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea is connected with this inflow. It was stated that the Baltic Sea is polluted by oil, phenols, lignin, detergents and some other heavy metals. The pollution by organic wastes was one of the reasons for significant and chronic oxygen deficiency in the lower layer of the sea over the last 20 years and for the rise in the ammonium nitrogen content. It was also stated that inflowing North Sea waters containing oil and detergents, are the source of substantial pollution of the Baltic Sea, which forces one to approach an evaluation of the balance of the sea's pollution in a new way. On the whole a tendency towards some decrease in the level of pollution of the Baltic Sea by oil and other detergents has been noted in recent years. ///              ,      ,   ,    ,        .             . ,     , , , ,   .                   20      .  ,    ,    ,      ,   -      .  ,                .

25099337| The report deals with the mathematical modeling technique of the pollution sources. The analysis has been made from the example of the Baltic Sea and its basin while the pollution sources of different types have been observed. Recommendations are made for the construction of the matrix of vectors characterizing the state and composition of the water in the Baltic Sea. The necessity for the gradual unification of the estimation model parameters with regard to the existing possibilities for collecting and processing the initial data of all Baltic Sea Countries is expressed. It is shown that the given estimation model of the load of wastes in the sea can be presented in the form of innumerable graphs and matrices. The presented mathematical model can be used for solving the reverse problem, since by knowing the permissible load of pollution in the marine environment, it is possible to determine the necessary water protection measures. The presented general model can be easily broken down and partially used (for example by the countries of the Baltic basin). ///  ,   ,          .

25099328| In Sweden the Environment Protection Act and the Environment Protection Ordinance came into force in 1969. They provide collective regulation of different kinds of environmental disturbances. For certain factories and other activities, applications for permits are compulsory before any activity starts. A special board, the Franchise Board for Environment Protection, holds the responsibility for the granting of permits. The main responsibility for environmental policy-making lies with the Ministry of Agriculture. Under the Ministry, the National Environment Protection Board is working at a central level. Regionally, 24 County Administrations are responsible for environmental planning and protection. Locally, the responsibility rests with the municipal authorities. When the Environment Protection Act came into force about 50% of the urban households were connected to biological treatment plants, 25% to primary treatment and 25% to sewage systems without any treatment plant. In mid 1975 60% of urban area households were connected to biological-chemical treatment plants and only 0.4% to a sewage system without treatment plant (Figure 1). The amount of discharged BOD from the entire pulp and paper industry has decreased from a maximum around 1965 of approximately 700,000 metric tons to around 350,000 tons today in spite of the increase in production (Figure 2). In 1967 a program was started to reduce emissions of mercury from chlorine production plants. The discharge was then around 25,000 kg per year in the waste water. Today the figure is approximately 0.5 kg/day. ///                  1969 .            .               .  ,        ,      .              .         ,    .           24  .       .         ,  50%         , 25% -      25% -    ,   .   1975 . 60%             0,4%       (. 1).          ,   700 000     -  1965 ,  350 000    ,     (. 2).  1967             .         25 000 .      0,5 /.

25099534| Biological investigations mainly aiming at rational fisheries, have been carried out in the Baltic for more than a hundred years. During the last few years, investigations into the influence of pollution on water organisms have been initiated. It is stated that self-purification in the mouth of the Neva takes place in the summer, then giving the greatest number of bacteria in the upper layer. This can be explained by the high content of oil products in the water. A comparison of results from the 1930's with those from the 1960's shows an increase of pollutants on the bottom by approximately 10 times, and a doubling in the water. Microbiological investigations in the Gulf of Riga indicate that pollution mainly occurs to the depth of 30 metres in those places where the rivers Daugava and Lielupe fall into the bay. The investigations further state that phytoplankton shows two bio-geographical complexes - arctic and boreal-arctic - in the spring period, that zooplankton is distributed unevenly in time and space and that the increasing salinity and the increase in temperature have promoted the development of representatives of flora and fauna that have not occurred before. The present situation in the Gulf of Riga does not cause the destruction of zooplankton organisms, but only makes the production more intense. The heavy inflow of river waters, enriching the sea with nutrients, promotes the distribution of fresh-water and sea-water organisms. ///  ,      ,       ,   .             . ,        ,         .        .   1930  1960 . ,      10 ,     .     ,  ,  ,    30 ,        . ,  ,     -  -   -   ,                     ,    .         ,     .    ,   ,        .

25099527| After a short introduction concerning the water balance and the general hydrographic features of the Baltic, the fate of nutrient salts in production and destruction of organic matter is described. The consequences of oxic and anoxic conditions for these processes are discussed. The different sources for discharge of phosphorus and organic matter into the Baltic are examined one by one, and their relative importance is examined. Based on some measurements, an attempt is made to estimate the total primary production of the Baltic. This primary production is compared with that of Danish waters. At the same time the importance of the benthic production is compared with that of the pelagic production. Based on the results thus obtained in the study, a first attempt is made to construct a rough model of the total transport of organic matter in the Baltic. The consequence of this transport to the oxygen content of the Baltic deep water, and the destruction of the organic matter are discussed. An improvement of an earlier model concerning the phosphorus is also given. ///           ,           .          .              ,     .            .        .             .      ,            .                .       .

25099314| The regional co-operation of the Baltic countries on the water balance of the Baltic Sea has already produced significant effects. Four meetings of experts have been held at which principles for working out the balance statement were settled, problems to be solved were distributed, and the current progress of balance works discussed. In order to overcome certain methodological difficulties a large research program called the "Pilot Study Year" has been launched which will include all the Baltic balance elements. The program will last from July 1975 to December 1976 inclusive. Periodic measurements of selected hydrological and meteorological elements will be carried out during the Pilot Study Year and monthly statements of the results obtained will be sent to countries co-ordinating individual elements. A special computing group has been formed to state the current water balance. Along with the "Pilot Study Year", Denmark started in 1974 another research program called the "Belt Project" aimed at evaluation of the marine environment situation of the Belt Sea. Estimation of water exchange between the Baltic and the North Sea is an important part of this program which will explain the mechanism of exchange, being a major element of the Baltic water balance. Both programs will also include attempts to evaluate the Solid matter balance, both in form of suspended solids and solutions. It is expected that these studies will be considerably developed when the Helsinki Convention provisions on the protection of the Baltic marine environment come into force. ///             .       ,       ,  ,  ,         .          ,  "  ",        .      1975   1976 .             ,        ,    .          .

25099592| The report deals with the ecological substantiation of the construction of the elementary models which reflect the changes of structure of freshwater plankton biocenosis under the influence of toxic pollutants. A simple model of biocenosis formed of blue-green and protococcal algae is considered in the conditions of a limited water area (reservoir of pond type). The changes in quantitative ratio of these components may be caused experimentically by introducing into the water body a selectively acting preparation with the characteristics of an algicide (for example, monuron). The ecological meaning of biocenosis transformation in this case lies in the transition of the "train" forms into the dominant ones. The changing of dominants can be both reversible and irreversible. Using detailed description and quantitative analysis of this process it can be formalized and treated by computers. ///         ,          .     ,     - ,      (  ).

25099542| Exchange processes in the Baltic Sea are studied with the aid of a simple two-box model. Water and salinity balance requires that certain relations between the exchange through the Danish Sounds and the vertical exchange across the halocline are satisfied. It is feasible to restrict further the possible combinations of such exchange by studying the change of the tritium content of the Baltic that has occurred during the last fifteen years. With the aid of these results the budget of oxygen, phosphorus and organic material is studied including the production and decomposition of organic compounds and the effects of gravitational settling of dead organic matter. The results clearly demonstrate the sensitivity of this body of water to a rather modest release of waste products from human activity. ///          2-  .                .         ,       ,     15 .    ,  ,     ,             .             .

25099305| The effects of cadmium on flounders (Pleuronectes flesus) were investigated in continuous flow experiments. The levels of cadmium in the water ranged from 5 g Cd/l to 10 mg Cd/l and the exposure period lasted for 2, 4 or 9 weeks. Cadmium seriously affected many physiological and biochemical functions. Thus, an anemia, a hyperglycemia and a disturbed regulation of calcium, potassium, magnesium and inorganic phosphate ions were found in flounders exposed to cadmium concentrations as low as 5-50 g Cd/l. There seem to be great similarities between the effects noted in the cadmium-exposed fishes and those of cadmium-poisoned mammals. ///    (1, 2)         (Pleuronectes flesus)   .         .

25099612|A quantitative survey of the meiobenthos of the deep Norwegian Sea has been carried out from samples collected during the "Norbi"-cruise with a Reineck grab. In the northern basins, animal densities have a mean value of 438 individuals/10 cm. The lower part of the Iceland-Faeroe ridge is the richest area investigated (720 ind./10 cm), while the centre of the Norwegian basin is very poor (less than 50 ind./10 cm). The meiofauna is largely dominated by nematodes (95.9%) but copepods, polychaetes and kinorhynchs are regularly found in the samples. There is no noticeable change in faunal composition of different basins. The abundance of meiobenthos has been compared with the distribution of organic matter in sediments measured through organic carbon, total nitrogen and proteins. This last parameter is correlated with meiofaunal densities while the two other and the C/N ratio have no significant relation with the fauna. This suggests that a large part of organic material is refractory to transformation by microorganisms and cannot be utilized by meiofauna. The surprising poorness of the central part of the southern basin is explained by the low organic input to the bottom induced by the particular hydrographic conditions of this zone (i.e., formation of deep-waters).
25099301| The heat of the cooling water discharges from fossil fuelled and nuclear power plants might lead to serious effects in the environment. In the local area the effects can generally be demonstrated as changes in the composition of the biological communities and in the ecosystem's function, which amongst other things affects the catchability of fish. There are, however, reasons to assume that several effects have a considerably larger radius of action than the direct influence of the heat. Particular attention should be paid to combined effects of heat and different types of polluting substances such as heavy metals, radioactive waste products, biocides or nutrient excesses, whose incorporation in biological material is stimulated by heat. Heat is thus conserved by its products, which have a considerably longer duration in the water than the heat itself. Another important question is that of the reinforcement of negative effects known as synergism. In this respect our experience is based mainly on experimental tests on separate species or individuals. The fact that lethal doses and critical exposure times of different toxic substances have a tendency to decrease at increased temperatures is, for various reasons, difficult to demonstrate in the field. Negative influences on vital functions of organisms must be assumed to exist in the ecosystem long before directly lethal levels are reached. Negative effects on a regional scale can also be apprehended by the favorable effects of heat on fish parasites and diseases. The heat increases the rate of decomposition of organic matter in the receiving water bodies and the induced flow of water permits a design of new transportation mechanisms, for instance of oxygen, by adapting the technique for intake and outlets of cooling waters to the existing hydrological situation. In the future heat and kinetic energy might be used to break up isolated water bodies and burn an excess of organic material in certain archipelago basins under supply of oxygen, which might lead to positive effects. Such management of cooling water systems requires detailed information on the ecological function of the affected water body and increased experience of combined and synergistic effects. In choosing between possible sites, areas have to be identified, where the available energy of the discharge, normally considered to be lost, can be used to improve water quality. ///  ,       ,      ,       .                 , ,  ,    .    ,   ,   ,  ,    .            ,    ,   ,     ,       .          ,     ,     .       ,    .               .  ,                         .  ,                 .                 .          ,         ,  ,               .  ,           ,              ,     .                             ,    ,   ,       .

25099533| During the 1960's, the abundance of the Gotland cod stock declined by some 50 per cent in comparison with that of the 'fifties. This can be explained by a decrease in the oxygen content in the near-bottom layers and by a decrease in the layer of optimum salinity. As a result, the spawning conditions have become unfavourable. The decrease in the oxygen content may be attributed to the low intensity of the inflow of the North Sea water. On the other hand, it is supposed that discharge of industrial and agricultural waste waters leads to an abundant development of zooplankton (and of the sprat stock) and to an intensive consumption of oxygen in the process of decomposition of organic substance in the near-bottom waters. However, an increase in the phosphate content was also observed in other water bodies (e.g. in Lake Constance) at the same time (in the mid-'fifties) and coincided in time with a large river discharge, which suggests that the source of the increased phosphate content may be associated with the similarity of climatic conditions, as well. ///  ,  ,  ,    50%     .            .         .        .   , ,       -        (  )           .

10.2307/25099603| Particulate organic matter (POM) in the deep sea is derived from five major sources: planktonic material, carcasses of large nekton, marine macrophyte detritus, terrigenous matter and chemoautotrophic production. The direct contribution of terrigenous matter to deep marine sediments is small. Sediment trap measurements show that small planktonic POM adds about 4 g C myr to the deep-sea carbon pool. The maximum expected input of pelagic Sargassum to the deep Atlantic is one-tenth of this, 0.4 g C myr. Calculations suggest the remains of large nekton contribute approximately 50 mg C myr while the rate of primary carbon synthesis by chemoautotrophs is estimated to be 0.01 to 0.1 mg C myr.

25099324| Main intra-yearly changes of hydrological conditions in the deep layer of the Baltic Sea depending on the peculiarities of Kattegat water advection are considered. After yearly Kattegat water penetrations of different intensity over the Darser and Drogden rapids, cyclic changes of temperature, salinity and oxygen content in the deep layer of the sea are observed. The peculiarities of the bottom relief, the different water densities of separate invasions and relatively slow intermixing of recently penetrated and "old" water masses cause compound stratification of the deep layer in the deeps of the southern and middle parts of the sea. The data on the approximate rate of Kattegat water movement deep into the Baltic Sea, the changes in the fluctuation amplitude of temperature, salinity and oxygen content and the rises of deep waters in the middle part of the sea are given. ///               .      ,        .            ,       ,         .            ,     .    -      ,             ""              . ,                      .        ,     ,             .

25099321| In order to study the state and balances of the different hydrochemical parameters in the Gulf of Bothnia a simple model has been developed. The outlines of the work can be seen in Figure 1 and the working method can be applied to any semi-enclosed sea or lake. The Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea have been divided into 8 sections and each section has been vertically divided into 2-4 boxes. When choosing the limits between the boxes, bottom topography, position of the measuring points and the vertical distribution of the chemical parameters have been considered. To be able to calculate weighted mean values, the volumes of each section and every 3 fathoms have been computed. Only the volume of each box is presented in this paper. Available data from 1968-1972 have been used for the mean values. Weighted mean values and total amounts of salt, PO-P, total P, NO-N, NH-N and total N are presented for each box. The discharges of water, phosphorus and nitrogen to each section have been calculated. Using Knudsen's relations a rough estimation of the water, phosphorus and nitrogen balances of the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea have been made. In these the exchanges through the Northern and Southern Quark can be seen. Efforts have been made to use the weighted mean values to compute the water exchange between the different boxes. Some successful results have been gained but will not be presented until a more general model has been completed. Weighted mean values can also be used to study geographical and temporal changes in the hydrochemistry of the Gulf of Bothnia. ///           ,    .      . 1,          .         8 ,      2-4   .           .             .       .   1968-1972        .      , PO-P,  P.

25099299| In this report the microbiological investigations carried out by the Institute of Biology of the Academy of Sciences of the Latvian SSR from the year 1965 are summarized. Considering the distribution of bacteria in the gulf water, the Gulf of Riga can be divided into three parts: the area around the river mouths, the littoral area, and the open gulf. The area around the river mouths is characterized by a great number of saprophytic bacteria which indicates intensive self-purification processes. The littoral part is characterized by a low content of bacteria. In the water column of the open gulf a low number of saprophytic bacteria has been observed. In the gulf bottom the number of bacteria increases towards the depth. This phenomenon is connected with the increase of organic matter. Oil-oxidizing bacteria in the gulf water indicate the presence of oil products and the biological destruction of these products. One can consider the observed microbiological processes in the Gulf of Riga as a model corresponding to processes proceeding in the Baltic as a whole. ///    ,       1965 .                .        ,       : ,    .        ,        .         .             - .  ,   1-3   ,       ,  ,       .               ,       .     ,      .          .                          .                , ,            ,      .           ,          .             ,      .                ,     .

25099591| The paper considers the model of a plankton chain of a water ecosystem. The following problems are studied. a) Direct problems for deterministic models. Model construction based on ordinary differential and partial equations. The structure of the equations is considered. The building of concrete toxicological models with chosen structure of equations is reduced to the determining of the parameters of these equations. Solving the equations with digital or analog computers. b) Inverse problems: the procedure for determining the coefficients of the second order partial differential equations is examined in general curvilinear orthogonal coordinates. This procedure is used to determine model parameters according to experimental data. These problems are also connected with the interpretation and technique of arranging experimental studies. The paper contains certain remarks on the stochastic simulation of ecosystems based on Monte Carlo principles. In conclusion, the author provides examples of ordinary toxicological models obtained through digital and analog computers as well as by hydrobiological experiment especially arranged to determine the parameters of models. ///        .   : )     .            .   .              .       . )  .           ,      .          .            .              -.      ,       ,      ,      .

25099307| Pike and eel collected annually between 1969-1971 from 52 different localities along the Swedish coast, have been analyzed for the presence of DDT and PCB substances. A total of 1425 eels and 910 pikes were analyzed in order to study the pollution trend during the three-year period, the distribution of pollution along the Swedish coast, and finally, to establish a baseline for investigations of the trend in future. No change in the levels could be established during the three investigated years. Outside urbanized and industrialized areas, relatively higher PCB and DDT levels were found, both in eel and pike. High PCB levels were found in eel especially on the Swedish west coast. The two studied species of littoral fishes show approximately the same levels for both DDT and PCB substances within the Baltic area. This is contrary to the condition for simultaneously collected, pelagic species such as herring (and seal), where the DDT levels - but not the PCB levels - are significantly higher in the Baltic proper compared to the levels in the Bothnian Sea, and Bothnian Bay. This can probably be explained by differences in contamination of surface water and deep water. ///   ,  (  1969-1971 ..)   52 ,    ,       .    1425   910         ,      , ,       .   3=          .               ,    .          .               ,      .     ,      ,    ( ),     ,   ,             . ,         .

25099304| In animals from the Baltic Sea certain amounts of chlorinated hydrocarbons, heavy metals and other environmental pollutants can be recognized. It cannot be stated today, however, whether this load has any direct or indirect effect on the aquatic fauna. To assess the potential impact it is necessary to conduct direct toxicity tests, the results of which should be verified in the field. At the Brackish Water Toxicology Laboratory of the National Swedish Environment Protection Board toxicological research on organisms from the Baltic has been carried out since the summer of 1973. The laboratory is situated at Studsvik, about 80 km SW of Stockholm. The main objective of the project has been to provide toxicological data from experiments with environmental pollutants found in the animals and the water of the Baltic. Acute mortality caused by pollutants will rarely occur in the sea. Therefore the work has been concentrated on sublethal effects which develop after a long time of exposure at low levels in the water. Methods for these studies have been developed or adapted to existing circumstances at the site of the laboratory. Two important steps have been taken to increase the relevance of the experiments, namely by performing them in natural sea-water and with animals caught in the sea. The methods used are intended to record the toxic effects at two different levels of integration. One in which the function of the entire animal is measured and one in which functions of organs, tissues, cells and subcellular elements are subjected to investigations. Effects recorded with the former methods can possibly be related to the function of the animal in its natural environment which must be the aim of this type of investigation. With the more specific physiological methods it is possible to establish the mode of action of the chemical in question. This is of great importance as it makes it possible to predict the effects of related compounds. Accumulation studies are performed parallel to the toxicity tests as knowledge about the accumulation pattern is a prerequisite for setting up relevant exposure conditions. The toxicity tests are mostly carried out in continuous flow aquaria. The test animal species are of marine as well as freshwater origin. ///        ,      . ,               .          ,       .    1973 ,                  .    ,   80   -  .        ,          ,        .  ,  ,     .        ,           .           .         ,  :         ,   .           .      ,       , ,    . ,   , ,          ,       .          ,   .    ,       .    ,   ,            .  ,  ,       .      ,    .

25099302| Fishery biological investigations form the main part of the biological research program at sites of Swedish nuclear power plants. The main aim is to estimate changes of the catchability of different species caused by the vast discharges of cooling-water from the plants. It is likely that the most profound changes in this respect will be caused by a disturbance of the balance between species with high and low temperature optima for vital functions of life, warm-and cold-water fishes. In laboratory experiments it has been shown that fishes prefer this optimum ("temperature preferendum") and have their maximum capacity for swimming at this level. In this paper catches in nets and fykes are related to these findings. The possible effects of thermal discharges are discussed on the basis of observations both under natural conditions and in a heated effluent. Fishing with bottom gill nets has been carried out regularly during May to October for nine years at 72 fixed stations covering different biotopes in three Baltic archipelagos. In one of them, Simpevarp, the first commercial nuclear power plant in Sweden is situated. Here a migration trap was constructed blocking the passage between the bay, which receives the cooling-water, and the open sea. The fishing with this trap and gill nets in the bay has gone on both before and after the start of the power station. The catch in a stationary tool like a net or a fyke is dependent mainly on the number of fish of catchable size in its vicinity and their swimming activity. According to the theory, temperature will increase the catch towards the temperature preferendum both by attraction and by raising the swimming activity. When years have been compared, significant correlations between catch and temperature have been established. Most of them refer to August and September and are positive for warm-water species and negative for cold-water species. The positive correlation is explained mainly by an increased activity, while the negative one may be due to an emigration into colder and deeper water and a lowered activity of remaining fish, when the preferred temperature is exceeded. In the cooling-water recipient, where changes in the number of fish have been followed, the heating has increased the catches in the nets of at least perch and roach. The species which are most frequently caught have been divided into three groups on the basis of the distribution of the catches in the migration trap and in the gill nets over intervals of temperature and over months. 1. Warm-water species: bream, silver bream, rudd, zanthe, ide, bleak, perch and roach. 2. "Eurythermal" species: flounder and ruffe. 3. Cold-water species: eel-pout, sea scorpion, fourhorn sculpin, cod and burbot. This succession corresponds rather well to available experimental data, but the preferred or optimum levels found in nature are lower. The distribution of fishes in Baltic archipelagos is to a great extent governed by temperature. Limnic species with high temperature preferenda dominate the shallow and sheltered localities, while marine species with low preferences are dominant in the outer and deeper parts of the archipelagos. The "living space" of the warm-water species is widened outwards and to deeper bottoms in summer and autumn at the expense of the cold-water species. This tendency is more accentuated in hot summers. It is likely that a heated effluent will have a similar effect upon the balance between species. ///                .           ,  ,   ,     .  ,    ,   ,            ,    ,  -   .     ,      temperature preferendum)        .             .        ,     ,     .             9   72  ,      .    , ,      .     ,    ,    ,   .                ,    .      ,  ,            .  ,     "temperature preferendum"      ,       .             .                  .   ,  ,  ,     , ,          ,     ,  ,      .           ,  ,      ,   ,   . ,    ,                ,      . 1.  : ,  , , Vimba vimba L., , ,   . 2.

25099317| Bacterial sulfate reduction has been studied in situ on a near-shore Baltic sediment at a water depth of 10 m. Experiments have been carried out in closed sediment-water systems of plexiglass boxes enclosing 32 l of water and a sediment surface of 0.16 m. The aim of this investigation was to examine the main factors involved in sulfate reduction, such as organic matter, water temperature, sulfate concentration, number of sulfate reducing bacteria, and kinetics of bacterial sulfate reduction. Four experiments have been carried out at different seasons during a period of three years. All data presented in this paper concern the water phase in the closed box-systems. The effect of organic matter was studied by adding different amounts of organic matter equivalent to 6.25, 12.5, and 25 g/m to the boxes. The organic matter was collected from a nearby sediment surface just before the experiments started. The total amounts of reduced sulfate were almost linearly related to the amounts of added organic matter in four parallel runs, started in late summer. The load of organic matter affects the total decrease in sulfate by about 30-40% per 6.25 g added organic matter per m. In a similar experiment started in the spring, additions of the same amounts of organic matter had no provable effect on sulfate reduction. The two experiments demonstrate a seasonal variation of the amounts of utilizable organic matter present at the sediment-water interface. The experiments were carried out at water temperatures between 1-16C. Sulfate reduction takes place at water temperatures above 4C in all experiments. At a starting temperature of between 3-6C the rate of sulfate reduction was 0.15-0.35 g SO-Smday. At a starting temperature of 10-12C the rate of sulfate reduction was 0.41-0.75 g SO-Sm day. A temperature increase in the water of 6-7C approximately doubled the rate of sulfate reduction. Some box-systems were given a rise in temperature of 5C. At low water temperatures (4C) the rate of sulfate reduction was increased by 50%, while at higher water temperatures (15C) this increase in temperature had no provable effect. In one experiment the total number of sulfate reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrio) was approximately 7 times increased. Compared to box-systems having their original bacteria mass, 10 individuals  cm in the uppermost part of the sediment, the rate of sulfate reduction was 4 times increased from 0.15 to 0.64 g SO-Smday. The total amounts of sulfate reduced increased by 4 times from 5.9 to 21.6 g SO-Sm. Sulfide (HS and HS) appeared in the water phase about 10 days after the day on which sulfate reduction was observed as a decrease in sulfate concentration. The rate of sulfide formation was generally of the same order as that of sulfate reduction. However, at the end of an experiment only about 30% of the reduced sulfate was recovered as sulfide due to the presence of photosynthetic sulfide oxidizing bacteria. The kinetics of bacterial sulfate reduction was found to be a first-order reaction, with K = 0.89  10  day. The reaction can also be interpreted as being a zero-order reaction changing to first order at a sulfate concentration around 2 mM, with K=3.2  10 m mole SO  1  day. ///     in situ     ,   10 .      -     ,  32      0,16 .      ,    ,  :  ,  ,  ,         .    ,        .            -.     ,       6,25, 12,5  25 /.            .               ; ,    ,   4-  .   6,25       ,      30-40%.   ,  ,            .          ,     -.     ,    1-16C.            4C.    3-6C     0,15-0,35  SO-S   ..   ,  10-12C,    0,41-0,75  SO-S   ..     6-7C     .   -    5C.

25099575| The paper deals with the contemporary state and tendencies of changes in the hydrological conditions in the deep layer of the Baltic Sea, which are under the influence of cosmic, climatic, meteorological and other factors. The main resulting factor of the ocean's influence is the flow of the Kattegat waters and the main influence of the surrounding land is the flow of the Baltic basin rivers. Both of these factors depend on the features of atmospheric circulation over the sea. By analyzing the data it was established that in the Baltic Sea long term, inter-yearly and intra-yearly cycles of change in the hydrological conditions of the deep layer can be observed and these are basically governed by variation in the volume of water in the rivers of the Baltic basin. The different salinity of the separate invasions of Kattegat waters causes a division of the deep layer of the sea into two subdivisions-the active deep layer and the bottom layer of the deeps. Against the background of the natural cycles of change in the hydrological conditions in the deep-water hollows of the middle and especially the northern part of the sea a worsening of the gas regime has been observed over the last 10-15 years, probably caused by the general pollution of the sea. ///              ,     , ,    .         ,     -    .          .     ,      ,         ,         .               -       .                   10-15     , , ,    .

25099300| Lake Mlaren is discharged, through the city of Stockholm, into a wide brackish water archipelago where a halocline is formed at a varying depth. Treated sewage water is discharged both into the lake and the archipelago. In May 1973 phosphate reduction was realized in the biggest sewage treatment plant of Stockholm. In situ fixation of molecular nitrogen has been measured in the trophogenic layer at thirteen stations in the Stockholm Archipelago, at one station in Lake Mlaren and in the land Sea, our reference station situated 70 km east of the coast. Measurements have been carried out during the vegetation periods since May 1972 using the acetylene reduction technique. The diurnal cycle of nitrogenase activity was studied twice. Acetylene reduction during incubation periods of different length and effects upon the acetylene test due to concentration of algal filaments have been investigated. In addition the primary production of phytoplankton has been measured by C-technique. Numbers of heterocysts have been determined for the actual species of blue-green algae and the nitrogenase activity perheterocyst calculated. An inhibition in activity as well as in photosynthetic rate was often found at the surface. The best depth for primary production often coincides with the depth of maximal acetylene reduction being explained by optimal light conditions. The layer with measurable acetylene reduction has about the same thickness as the photosynthetic layer. The nitrogen fixing period in 1972 started in the middle of June and continued for about three months. The active period was then diminished during 1973 and 1974 in the inner parts of the archipelago and started at the end of July 1974. Fixation was correlated with presence of heterocystous blue-green algae. Nitrogen fixation is slight and of no importance in S. Bjrkfjrden (Lake Mlaren) and in the area close to Stockholm. One probable reason for this is the high amount of mineral nitrogen in the water. Further out the fixation increases rapidly, reaching maximal values in the central part of the archipelago, Stations 4-6, where contents of mineral nutrients in the water are very low. A decreasing tendency in total fixation as well as in heterocyst activity is evident in the inner parts during the three years investigated. The obviously diminished supply of assimilable phosphorus in the treated sewage water is a probable reason. On the other hand, in the outer parts of the archipelago and in the land Sea, where there is an excess of phosphate-phosphorus, unaltered, high heterocyst activity is shown during the three years investigated. ///  ,        ,        .       ,     .   1973              .     in situ      13   ,        ,      70     . ,    1972 ,          .       .                   .  ,     C-.       -        .       ,    .            ,     .           .     1972            .      1973  1974            1974 .      - .          .   )     .      -      .        ,       ( 4-6),          .      ,              .             .   ,        ,     ,           .

25099609|The hadal benthos of the Puerto Rico Trench suggests that a eutrophic system is present in two areas where an abundance of plant debris and other organic material are introduced into a suitably oxygenated bottom water mass. This is evidenced by a standing crop of meiofauna, 91 to 97% nematodes and harpacticoid copepods, between 17059 and 17303 individuals/m, based on two box corer samples taken at 8560 and 8580 m in the Brownson Deep. Analysis of two otter trawl samples of macrofauna revealed the presence of a wide spectrum of species representing different trophic types. Osmotrophic organisms such as actinarian anthozoans and pogonophorans and wood-infesting cocculinid gastropods are common in the eutrophic Gilliss Deep. Deposit feeding animals such as holothurians, isopods, amphipods and cumaceans represent the dominant trophic type, at 7600 m in the Gilliss Deep and 8800 m in the Brownson Deep. The use of the Puerto Rico Trench as a site for waste disposal is questioned on the basis of the eutrophic character and the relatively unpredictable tectonic nature of the trench.
25099525| 1. The Baltic Sea shows by example, the magnitude of the dangers from industrial and domestic wastes that are discharged into seas that are weakly connected with the ocean system. 2. The Baltic Sea can now be considered to be a sea that stores different substances that are discharged with industrial and domestic wastes. In this case, the pollutants disperse throughout the Baltic Sea area. Under the influence of these wastes in the sea, chemical compounds (oil-products etc.) that are not characteristic of the sea appear. The chemical content has changed considerably, as is evidenced by increasing values for BOC and oxidizability. In many coastal regions, oxygen deficiency is observed. /// 1.     ,         ,     . 2.      ,   ,      .           .         , ,   . .,      .      ,     BOC  .       . [Abstract in Russian] 
25099615|Upper continental rises and lower continental slopes are believed to have the best potential of the entire deep-ocean floor for future supplies of petroleum. However, information is based only upon inferences from indirect geophysical and geological data. If drilling supports these inferences, deep-ocean petroleum may considerably augment existing sources. Serious pollution of the ocean is unlikely, because upper rises and lower slopes are remote from shores and areas of intense fishing.
25099601| Planktonic debris falling into the deep sea consists of organic matter plus skeletal hard parts. Deep sea sedimentary organic matter is less abundant than that in shallower-water sediments of similar grain size. Also, it is depleted in phosphorus, relative to carbon, and is more refractory. Its reactivity, in terms of rates of microbiological decomposition, and its stoichiometric C:N:P composition, can be determined through the use of diagenetic models and interstitial water compositional data. Models are presented here which apply to organic matter decomposition in anoxic sediments, but the general principles can be applied to oxic deep sea sediments once appropriate interstitial water data become available. Diagenetic modeling has shown that the rate constant for sulfate reduction in a wide variety of sediments, ranging from harbor muds to pelagic clay, is directly proportional to the square of the rate of deposition. Pelagic hard parts sedimented to the bottom consist of CaCO (forams, coccoliths, pteropods) and opaline silica (diatoms, radiolaria). It is usually assumed that the major source of CaCO contributed to the bottom is calcite in the form of forams and coccoliths. However, studies of plankton tows, sediment traps, and calcareous oozes which have been deposited in sufficiently shallow water that no CaCO components have dissolved, when combined with oceanic mass balance calculations, indicate that as much as 50% of the CaCO falling to the bottom consists of aragonite, mainly in the form of pteropod remains. This number is much bigger than previously believed. Pteropod shells are rare in most deep sea sediments, not because they are supplied in low relative amounts, but because they are dissolved away prior to burial at essentially all abyssal depths, while calcitic forams and coccoliths dissolve away only below 4500 m. This preferential dissolution results from the fact that aragonite is distinctly more soluble than calcite. 
25099543| As a consequence of the increasing transport of oil by sea, increasing quantities of petroleum products are drained into the seas in connection with the cleaning of tanks. In order to counteract this type of pollution, a method has been developed for cleaning tankers in port. Two preparations, ML-2 and ML-22, are used in a solution of fresh water, and a third one, ML-6, is used in a solution of salt water. The preparations are characterized by the fact that they form emulsions of low resistance with the oil residue in the tank to be cleaned. After having been heated to 70-80 C, the solution is sprayed into the tank under pressure. Then the emulsion that is formed is sucked back and the preparations are re-extracted. Through this closed system the cleaning solution may be used and re-used 10-15 times. After the tanks have been cleaned in this way they may be used for transporting food-stuffs, e.g. raw sugar or cereals. ///      ,   ,        .     .       .  , -2  -22          -6     .   ,              .    70-80 ,      . ,          .    ,      10-15 .     ,       ,       .         .

25099611|As the continental slope descends and the water deepens, the average size of Ascidians decreases, passing from more than 1 cm in the neritic zone to 2.5 mm or less on the abyssal plain. There is a corresponding decrease in weight from 25 to 1. When all the organs are reduced in the same proportions (number of branchial bars, of gonads, of endocarps, etc.), there is miniaturization of the animal, and the further down the continental slope they are, the smaller the species of the same genus become (1). The reduction in size can also lead to the simplification of certain organs, especially the branchial sac, where the very structure of the organ may be modified. This occurs in particular genera unknown in the shallow water zone. This phenomenon, which is general among Ascidians, is also found in other abyssal invertebrates (2). Ascidians, because their mode of food intake is based on filtering water, make it possible to hypothesize a relation between reduction in size and undernourishment.

25099313| The aim of this paper is to give information about a present investigation of the transport of water and nutrients through the land Sea and to give some examples of the preliminary results. The investigation is carried out in co-operation with the Marine Research Institute in Finland which is responsible mainly for the chemical work. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute is concentrating on the current pattern and the water transports. During June to December 1973 and 1974, 12 recording current meters with temperature sensors were placed at 4 stations in a section between Sweden and land in the sill area Understen-Mrket. The instruments, placed at 8, 40 and 70-80 m depth, have worked fairly well and the data return is 75-90% of expected. A recording temperature meter placed outside Understen has collected data from 11 different levels during the same time periods. The observations are so far evaluated only for certain periods. The results show that in the horizontal the currents in the surface layer have the same principal direction over the whole section during about 20% of the time. The surface currents on the western side are more often going towards the south rather than the north and are stronger in this dominant direction. In the eastern part the southerly currents are still predominant but not to such an extent as on the western side. In deeper layers the northerly current is dominant on the western side and almost as frequent as the southerly on the eastern side. The currents are often of the same direction through the whole vertical and no pronounced two-layer current system has been observed. The typical time periods for the transports towards north or south seem also to differ along the section. They are about 1-3 days on the western side and only about 1 day on the eastern. The size of the transport calculated as a daily mean value is up to 10 km/day both to the north and to the south in the summer. Calculations based on water level recordings show that water transports to or from the Gulf of Bothnia coupled to volume variations are of the size of 5-10 km/day during summer and up to 40 km/day during late autumn (1973). During 1975-76 the field observations with recording instruments will be restricted to current and temperature measurements at only one station but they will instead be extended over the whole winter period. In addition, occasional measurements of temperature, salinity and nutrients will also be carried out. ///                       .      -  ,        .              .   - 1973-1974 ,  4 ,       ,    -,   12 ,       . ,    8, 40  70-80 ,   ,       75-90%.   ,   ,    11   .        .  ,                  20% .          ,    ,      .        ,     ,   .            ,    .           ,       .        , -,      .   1-3           .  ,     ,   10 /.    ,    . ,     , ,         ,     ,  5-10 /.    40 /.

25099331| This report presents the results of an intercalibration study in which five Baltic laboratories carried out residue analyses of organochlorine compounds in maize oil. The following compounds were studied: HCB, -, - and -BHC, dieldrin, DDT, DDD, DDE and PCBs. One spiked and one unspiked maize oil sample containing levels commonly found in environmental samples were distributed. The laboratories were asked to determine the levels by using their routine clean-up and gas chromatographic quantification procedures. The concentrations were even to be estimated after using two specified clean-up procedures and by gas chromatography on the column material that was supplied. In this paper the results of the intercalibration are tabulated and chromatograms that were run on the supplied column are shown. Comments are made on the results and possible sources of errors are suggested. The necessity of using interference-free solvents and reagents can be seen from the chromatograms run on the unspiked sample. The importance of good gas chromatographic separation when analysing such complex mixtures is also demonstrated. ///                       .  ,            ,  8-15  1974 .   , .      ,  (18-24  1974 .).      ,       .     ,        ,     (    )       )   .

25099576| The results of published data on the study of decomposition (mineralization) of the organic matter of dead plankton under experimental conditions in aerobic and anaerobic environments were examined. In most cases the mentioned process can be described by an equation of the first order reaction. The degree of mineralization of organic matter under optimal conditions, in long-term experiments, averaged 70-80 per cent of the initial organic matter. The remaining 20-30 per cent represent poorly assimilated organic matter-water humus, formed by the transformation and mineralization of initial organic matter and found mainly in undissolved form. In natural water bodies, in the presence of zooplankton and zoobenthos (i.e. under aerobic conditions), the quantity of accumulated undissolved water humus is less by comparison with water bodies containing hydrogen sulphide and with experimental data. ///        ()       ,     .             .            70-80%    .  20-30%            - ,     .   ,   ,       ,             .

25099330| An intercalibration on phytoplankton counting, chlorophyll measurements, and macrofauna sampling was performed in order to reveal the comparability and reliability of results derived by different scientists. Statistical tests have been applied to mean values, for phytoplankton abundance and biomass (cell volume), for the amount of chlorophyll a, b, and c, and phaeopigment a in water, and for benthic macrofauna abundance, size distribution and biomass (wet and dry weight). As a general rule most of the results were not comparable, though the methods used for the separate analyses seemed to be almost identical. Great variations were obtained for phytoplankton counts, even within the same laboratory. Standardized factors for conversion of abundance to cell volume were not applied, and different laboratories did not count the same number of species. Only measurements of chlorophyll a, uncorrected and corrected for phaeopigment a, gave reproducible values for respective laboratories, but when compared between laboratories no results were comparable. With regard to macrofauna, biomass values showed the greatest dispersions, and the numbers of small specimens were very different too. This intercalibration must be regarded only as a check of the comparability of the final results, since it was not possible to identify the main sources of error, causing the discrepancies. The sources could be different manual treatment of samples or different analytical equipment. ///      ,   ,      ,      .         ) ) ,   a b  c   a  ,   ,       (   ).  ,      ,  ,    , -,   .              .           ,       .    a,       a,      ,        .   ,     ,       .          ,        ,   .            ,   .

25099604|The availability of food is believed to be the main factor structuring the deep-sea benthos. Results are presented for the quantitative distribution of meiofauna from different oceanic regions. Meiofaunal densities are predictable to a certain extent, and further investigations should be done in conjunction with the other benthic size groups for an evaluation of the total benthos. The size structure of the benthic communities is discussed for the infauna. Standing stock of megafauna seems not to fit into the system, however, data are restricted to continental slope and rise areas and pelagic feeding of fishes, believed to be demersal, result in a biomass too high for benthic food resources. The distribution of detritus and fliter feeders, ontogenetic development, internal structures, content of organic matter per size and weight, low diversity in abyssal regions, and behavior of opportunistic species, all can be viewed under the aspect of severe food limitation, and presumably reduced energy demand, low maintenance costs and high conversion efficiency. Food energy structures the deep-sea benthos. The structure of benthic communities is an aspect which was followed from the beginning of biological deep-sea research. While in the early years investigations were addressed to taxonomic questions, the interest later centered around life forms, on the adaptation of species and communities to deep-sea conditions. Ecological factors structuring the deep-sea benthos are described in a number of publications, however, one factor seems to be of overall prime importance: energy in the sense of food availability.
25099329| The SSVL environmental care project was a joint effort by the Swedish Forest Industries and the Swedish State. The project started in 1970 and the results were reported in 1974. The total costs for the project were 13 million rubels of which the government provided 1.1 million rubels. Many Swedish companies provided people and equipment free for which the costs can be estimated at 9.2 million rubels. The direct costs of the project were about 4.3 million rubels. The SSVL project was divided into eight subprojects according to the sources of pollutants from pulping and paper-making. These subprojects were as follows: Closure of the cooking-washing-screening system Bleaching Evaporation and treatment of condensates Temporary discharges Handling of sludge System-closing in paper mills Biological and chemical treatment of waste water Air pollution problems The technical results of the SSVL project are presented in this paper and some implications in connection with the Baltic are discussed. /// SSVL               .     1970 ,     1974 .     13 . .,      1,1 . .           ,    9,2 . .   , ,   4,3 . .

25099303| The effect of heavy metals (mercury, lead, cadmium), dissolved oil and PCB on the rate of photosynthesis in the natural phytoplankton population in the Kurshsk Bay has been studied with the help of radio-carbon at in situ temperatures and light conditions. The inhibiting action of the admixtures tested has been recorded at concentrations of 1 ppb for PCB, 5 ppb for mercury and 1,000 ppb for lead. A considerable decrease in the rate of photosynthesis in terms of synergetic effects has resulted from simultaneous introduction of 1 ppb PCB and 50 ppb of dissolved oil. The data presented and results of similar observations carried out previously in other regions testify to the possibility of anomalous changes in phytoplankton production rate and species structure under conditions of chemical pollution of marine neretic waters. ///      -     ,    1974 .     . .              ,   ,     ()        .        ,                .     ,        10%   .         : Nitzschia palea, N. closterium, Sceletonema costatum, Microsystis aeroginosa, Coscinodiscus perforatus.      ,     50%   5  ,   50         .       :        1000    Pb,               5  500   .         ,      50  5000        .         ,       1       .       , , ,                   .             ,       .                .             .   ,                             -          .

25099613|Ecological features of deep-sea Asellota in the Bay of Biscay are analysed from the results of 7 abyssal cruises (July, 1972 to October, 1974) covering seasonally a northern transect with 4 stations and a southern area with 2 stations. Density, estimated with a Reineck box corer, ranges from 4 to 72 individuals per m. Agreement is found between decrease of density with increasing depth and distance from land. Amount of organic matter is related to abundance of specimens only at 2000 m depth. In contrast, variations of density in the deeper stations (3000 m to 4700 m) are not related to abundance of organic matter in sediment, but rather with C/N ratio, which may be considered as a significative trophic component. Species diversity (calculated by Shannon index on cumulative samples from each station) shows important variations between northern and southern areas and discriminates the deepest stations, where lower values are observed. Inertia methodology provides a synthetic description about qualitative and quantitative faunistic variation. Two major faunistic discontinuities are exhibited: the first one, vertical, isolates the species assemblage of 2000 m depth; the second one, regional, discriminates northern and southern regions of the Bay of Biscay at 2000 m depth. Gradual faunistic variation related with depth is observed in the deeper stations. According to environmental parameters, the faunistic structure at 2000 m may be considered as predominantly physically controlled: on the other hand, the deeper stations are regarded as biologically accommodated.
25099610|Quantitative data on the deep-sea megabenthos is difficult to obtain; towed collecting gears are notoriously non-quantitative, while photographic surveys are time-consuming and the results are often difficult to interpret in the absence of samples. An automatic camera system, mounted on an epibenthic sledge, has been used in a preliminary study in an attempt to overcome these problems. The photographs to provide some information on the density and spatial distribution of the megabenthic organisms, but the area of sea-bed covered both by single exposures and by the combined photographs of a single haul is relatively small, so that reliable data are obtained only for the most abundant animals. More importantly, the photographs confirm not only that the collecting gear fails to obtain quantitative samples, but also that its performance varies from haul to haul and that the samples may not even be qualitatively representative of the megabenthic community.
25099573| Liebig's Law of the Minimum and its applications to the conditions in sea water are discussed, especially with reference to phosphorus and nitrogen as growth-limiting factors. Complications caused by different limiting factors are discussed. Mitscherlich-Baules' equation is explained and it is shown that when the concentration of a limiting nutrient, eg P, is increased, another factor, eg N, may become limiting. The effects of phosphorus and nitrogen deficiency on cells and cell growth are described. The conditions in the Baltic are discussed in detail and the difficulties of interpreting the effects of different nitrogen compounds acting as nutrients are described. The N:P relation in Baltic surface water is shown during different seasons and the difficulties of estimating the relation when the concentrations of the parameters are low during the summer are explained. The anomalies in the N:P ratio in Baltic deep water are explained and examples from the Gotland basin during reducing and oxidizing conditions in the water are given. Reasons for the anomaly are shown to be the increase of the phosphate concentration through release of P from the sediments and the conversion of nitrate to nitrogen gas in oxygen-deficient water. In that way nitrogen is removed from the biological cycle. The relation between organic carbon and organic phosphorus in the deep water is discussed and it is shown that the amount of organic C is far too high in the water, compared to the theoretical amount obtained from the atomic relation 100:1 between C and P. The relation C:N indicates that the dissolved organic matter in the Baltic consists mainly of humus, which generally has a very low phosphorus content. ///            ,       ,    .  ,    .    -  , ,     ,  , ,  ,  ,   .           .         ,       ,   .

25099606|Deep benthic communities of the Bay of Biscay (North East Atlantic) have been thoroughly sampled during seven cruises between 1972 and 1974. Some 200 samples using three main types of gear (corer, epibenthic sled and beam trawls) have been performed. Sediment characteristics (granulometry, organic content) and faunal densities for each size assemblage are given. Continental influences appear to increase macrofaunal density. Compared with other areas, the central part of the Bay of Biscay appears to have a low faunal density. This fact can be related to the existence of a mesoscale gyre of the upper layer, which could be responsible for a low primary productivity.
25099618|This paper examines the impact of six to eight years of industrial dumping at a deepwater (2500 m) dumpsite off the east coast of the United States. Data from Smith-McIntyre grab samples (sediment and macrofauna), water and nekton samples within and outside the dumpsite were examined. It is concluded that past dumping activities at Deepwater Dumpsite 106, located 222 km southeast of New York City, have not produced any obvious impact on the community structure or heavy metal body burdens in benthic macrofauna or nekton.
25099594| The need for model studies related to the physical state of the Baltic is stressed. These models, in the first stage, must be quite simple in order to provide us with a basic understanding of the processes involved. Still, time-dependence is an essential feature, considering that we deal with a statistical rather than a true steady state, involving important Reynolds effects arising in the salt transport equation, as well as the hydraulic relation applicable at the entrance to the Baltic. Examples of such effects are given, using a two-layer model for the Baltic developed by the author. The theoretical work suggests certain field measurements that should be made in the Baltic. A comparison is given with some oceanic measurement programs. ///         .         ,        .       ,   ,       ,     ,    ,     ,    ,       .    ,    ,    .          .        .

25099541| The ecosystem of the Baltic is characterized by natural fluctuations, but the influence of human activities, also, contributes to the observed changes. The paper suggests that the problem of predicting the state of pollution of the Baltic can be solved by means of analysis of ecosystem models. The purpose of developing models is to facilitate the setting of accurate limits to possible discharges and other interferences with normal life within the ecosystem. For more profound analyses, there are two different models to be considered and combined, one dealing with hydrodynamics, and the other describing the biological interrelation in the ecosystem. The hydrodynamic model must consider the subdivision in three layers of the Baltic, separated from each other by haloclines, where the primary source of energy in the upper layer is the wind and in the deepest layer the inflow of water of high salinity through the Danish sounds. The aim of the biological model is to describe the total energy flux and substances discharged through all trophic levels. In addition, the effects of pollutants are taken into account. As less complex, the hydrodynamic model will probably be the first one to be closed for the Baltic. ///      ,        .    ,               .                   .        ,       ,   ,      .          ,     ,         ,          ,    .          ,     .  ,      .   ,         .

25099535| The contamination of Swedish marine waters with DDT- and PCB-substances has been studied mainly on herring and cod, but results are also given for other species. In this preliminary report the highest levels for DDT-substances are recorded from the central southern part of the Baltic, while lower mean values are found in the northern part (the Gulf of Bothnia), west of Bornholm and off the Swedish west coast. For PCB-substances it seems to be approximately the same amount in the central southern part of the Baltic, east of Bornholm, as in the northern part. West of Bornholm and off the Swedish west coast lower levels are recorded. The analytical results are given both on fresh tissue basis and on fat weight. The results are discussed in view of the age of the fish and of aspects as migratory and feeding habits.

25099298| In order to reduce the heavy growth of planktic as well as benthic algae occurring every summer in the waters surrounding Stockholm, attempts are being made to reduce mutrient inputs from sewage effluents. When choosing the substances which at first hand are to be eliminated, it is important to find out what is actually limiting algal production in the different parts of the complex, receiving body of water. From a general point of view, phosphorus and nitrogen occupy a place apart in the role of growth-limiting chemical factors. However, different trace elements and organic substances with chelating capacity or biological effects may also play a limiting role in different waters. The purpose of this investigation was to test the possible limiting effect of some substances. During 1973 and 1974, thirty-four in situ enrichment experiments were performed with the natural phytoplankton population in fresh and brackish waters surrounding Stockholm. The limiting effects on primary production of nitrate, phosphate, chelator (EDTA), chelated iron and chelated trace element solution containing Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, Cu, B and Mo were tested. The substances were tested separately or in combinations, 16 combinations in toto. The results were compared with the contents of phosphate phosphorus and mineral nitrogen in the surface water. With regard to the aestival distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus directly available to algae, the investigation area may be divided into four different nutritive types. Close to Stockholm, we find an area relatively rich in mineral nutrients. Whenever it was at all possible to stimulate C uptake in this area, this was done by the addition of chelated trace-metal solution. Some areas, especially on the fresh water side, are characterized by an excess of mineral nitrogen (10 g/l) and very low phosphate phosphorus concentrations (<2 g/l). Under these circumstances, the algal carbon assimilation was stimulated by additions of phosphate with or without chelated trace metals. In 1973, an area with an excess of phosphate developed during the heavy Oscillatoria Agardhii bloom. There it was possible to increase C uptake by adding nitrate and chelated trace metals. In 1974 no area with an excess of phosphate developed. During a great deal of the vegetation period and in large parts of the investigation area, the concentrations of phosphate and mineral nitrogen are very low, less than 10 g/l of mineral nitrogen and less than 2 g PO-P/l. According to the experimental results, nitrogen was the most important substance in increasing C uptake under these circumstances, although it sometimes had to be combined with either phosphate or chelated metals. The most significant difference between the two years compared is the fact that while chelator (with or without trace elements) was most often implicated as a stimulatory nutrient in 1973, this was rarely the case in 1974. The importance of phosphate as a limiting factor had increased from 1973 to 1974. This is probably in accordance with the diminishing concentrations of phosphate in the waters concerned. ///  ,        ,      ,  ,           .   ,       ,  ,          ,   .   ,            . ,     ,        ,        .           .   1973  1974    34      in situ         ,  .    , ,  (),      ,  Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Co, B  Mo,   .      ,  16 .

25099536| When studying the incoming admixtures and the self-purification of the coastal sea waters it is necessary to take into account a) any significant background content, not only of mineral micro-constituents but also of organic substances; b) inconstancy of the hydrodynamic characteristics of each investigated area. It is quite evident that there is no single indicator of the state and self-purification of polluted waters that is at the same time universal. The right conclusion can be made not only from the results of physical and chemical analyses of water, but from the data of bacteriological and hydrobiological investigations of the polluted and clean sea regions. Commonly-used physical indicators are: during visual survey one can obtain highly valuable information about the distribution of sewage on the surface from the presence of film, oil-spots, floating suspended substances and other admixtures. With the Secchi disc and corresponding scale the transparency and the colour of water can be determined. Determination of the water smell with light heating is highly indicative. Commonly-used chemical indicators are: pH, alkalinity, mineral nitrogen-compounds, phosphates, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, organic substance, some heavy metals (Pb, Hg), phenols, petroleum products, detergents, radioactive pollutants. Undoubtedly, it is necessary to make synchronous hydrological and meteorological observations. A minimum complex of parameters should include salinity, water and air temperature, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, cloudness, waves. ///            : )        ,        ; )   .              .             ,           ( )   .       :        ,    ,    .       ,      (  ).     : pH, ,   , ,  ,   ,   ,   , ,  , . .  ,             : ,    , ,  , , .

25099306| The influence of the salinity on the accumulation of cadmium has been studied. A freshwater fish, the minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) and a marine fish, the common goby (Pomatoschistus minutus), were exposed to cadmium at various salinities. For both species it was found that the salinity was a very important modifying factor and especially for the freshwater fish. After 10 and 24 days of exposure in fresh water the accumulation was 6-10 times higher than it was in 7.2  salinity. Also for the marine fish increased salinity led to lower concentrations of cadmium in the bodies. The effect of temperature on accumulation was studied for 35 days in an experiment with the shrimp Leander adspersus. The animals, divided into two groups with a water temperature of 6 and 15C, respectively, were exposed to various concentrations of cadmium in the water. The accumulation seemed to increase by a factor of two when the group from 15 is compared to the group in 6C. In a series of experiments with bleaks, Alburnus alburnus, it was found, when mortality occurred in the experimental groups, that the accumulation pattern, based on surviving individuals, was rather confusing compared to results from experiments where no mortality had occurred. A specially designed experiment showed that moribund fish had a significantly elevated whole-body concentration of cadmium. Consequently, in an experiment in which mortality occurs the highest water concentrations of cadmium produce a strong selection among the individuals in the aquaria. A practical consequence of this finding is that it might be misleading to base an opinion of the pollution load on a particular fish population, unless the magnitude of a direct (by the pollutant itself) or indirect (e.g. by selective predation) mortality caused by the pollutant is known. ///      .   -  (Phoxinus phoxinus)    -   (Pomatoschistus minutus)    50 /)    .     ,       ,    .  10-  24-        6-10  ,    7,2- .  ,           .        35      Leander adspersus. ,   2     (6  15C),       . -,      15,   6.

25099581| A brief outline is given of the relations between the fish fauna of the Baltic Sea and its environment. The main part of the fish catch is taken in the Baltic proper (south of the land Sea). Herring, sprat and cod are the most important species. Herring is also fairly abundant in the land Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia. The main differences between these two areas and the Baltic proper are the higher salinity of the deep water and the permanent halocline of the latter. The distribution of the marine fish fauna is related above all to the water salinity. The oxygen conditions of the depths are also of importance. During stagnation periods the spawning and feeding areas of cod and other demersal species are reduced. On the other hand, nutrients are mobilized from the sediments during such periods, resulting in a higher plankton production later on. Pelagic fish, like herring and sprat, are favored in this way. Tagging experiments show that Baltic herring and cod make important migrations inside the Baltic proper. To some extent, young cod emigrate to the land Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia. The herring populations of the northern areas mentioned do not migrate-or migrate only to a very restricted extent-to areas south of the land Sea. There is a regular migration from the south, however, to the western part of the land Sea. Though the total fish catch has been rising during recent years, the risk of over-fishing in the Baltic is now very great. A rationing of the catches of cod, herring and sprat will probably be a principle task for the new Baltic fishery convention. ///           .

25099616| One of the most difficult problem areas coupled with utilization of nuclear energy is radioactive waste disposal. A potentially realistic solution for high-level waste disposal is burial beneath the deep sea, where containment on the order of 10 years may be attainable. Several practical criteria suggest that mid-tectonic plate regions under central oceanic gyres are most promising as disposal sites. While the intention is to completely isolate wastes from the biosphere, it is essential to learn what would be the result of accidental exposure of the benthos. Our modest available knowledge allows establishment of some hypotheses. Low benthic standing crop in conjuction with low turnover rates suggests that any effects other than possible mortality will be relatively slow. High diversity dependent on extreme environmental stability suggests both sensitivity to novel environmental distrubances and especially slow recovery rates. The cosmopolitan distribution of higher taxa within depth zones makes unlikely the disturbance of more than a small fraction of the total range of a basic community type. Species also seem to have broad distributions, minimizing the probability of extinctions. Of equal importance is the question whether the deep benthic fauna would accelerate the return of radionuclides to man. While there exists a special epibenthic pelagic fauna, including taxa that feed on the benthos, which should constitute the first link in a food chain leading back up the water column, this pathway is likely to be tenuous. Horizontal mobility is probably also a minor pathway. Of greater concern is the possible metabolic solubilization of undesirable substances allowing transport by currents. However, other biological processes may cause precipitation of dissolved substances. Bioturbation will prolong exposure of deposited substances to the water interface, although it will also accelerate initial burial of particles settling from above.

25099335| Im Rahmen zweiseitiger Regierungsabkommen zwischen der DDR und der Volksrepublik Polen ber die Zusammenarbeit auf dem Gebiet der Wasserwirtschaft an den Grenzgewssern werden gemeinsam abgestimmte Untersuchungen ber die Wasserbeschaffenheit u.a. in der Oderbucht durchgefhrt. Die Grundlage fr den Datenaustausch bilden fr beide Seiten verbindliche Arbeitsmethoden, die eine Vergleichbarkeit der Meergebnisse gewhrleisten: z.B. wird die Vergleichbarkeit der anorganischen Nhrstoffuntersuchungen mit den Untersuchungseinrichtungen der Teilnehmer am Methodenvergleich auf Ask besttigt. Fr das Untersuchungsgebiet werden Maximal- und Durchschnittswerte anorganischer Nhrstoffkomponenten mitgeteilt. Unter Anwendung der EDV (Elektronische Daten Verarbeitung) werden korrelative Zusammenhnge fr einige mineralische Kriterien durch Repressionsgleichungen beschrieben und graphisch fr die Oberflchenschicht und den grundnahen Wasserkrper dargestellt, um den natrlichen Gewsserzustand zu kennzeichnen. ///                             .       ,           ; ,         -      .                   ,      .

25099607| Replicate box cores taken at one 2875-m deep spot in Rockall Trough showed low variance, in terms of the number and sorts of species and their relative abundances, of polychaete worms and bivalve molluscs. Single core samples taken from other locations and depths in Rockall Trough could therefore be regarded as representative of their respective areas. The cores as a whole showed fairly uniform expected species diversities and standing crop; though in the case of diversity, slightly lower (29-36 species per 100 individuals) and for standing crop slightly higher (ca. 4 g.m) values in relation to comparable data from elsewhere in the world ocean. The high biomass, at least, may reflect strong, possibly turbid, bottom currents as much as high surface productivity immediately above. Ordination of the samples by means of correspondence analysis clustered the cores taken from the same area, with a clear ordination of the remainder in relation to decreasing depth. This supports the idea of a homogeneous benthos varying but little over the floor of deep sea basins, but perceptibly in relation to bathymetry on the continental margin. 
25099584| Sediments from the Baltic Sea have been sampled in 1968 and during 1972-73. The surface layer contained both PCB and DDT. The occurrence of DDE and DDD indicates that biological transformations take place. The amount of these metabolites, however, is much lower than in fish and plankton. The yearly load of DDT on the bottom sediments is much less than the input. PCB seems to be added to the Baltic Sea both diffusely and by dumping. ///        1968 .    1972-1973 .     ,   .       ,     .   , ,  ,       .          .  ,         ,    . [Abstract in Russian] 
25099574| The first half of this paper is an attempt to summarize some pertinent investigations-Swedish and others-concerning the problem of marine oil pollution, with special reference to the Baltic. A Swedish group designed a method to mark the oil cargo of a ship by adding microparticles of different alloys. Thus an analysis of the particles in an oil spill at sea makes it possible to identify the ship which caused the damage. Several Finnish investigations of a major oil spill in the Baltic are reviewed, as well as studies of the biological effects of oil on phytoplankton, seaweeds, crustaceans, fish fry and eggs and adult fishes. The second half of the paper describes a current study of the content of mineral oil in the water masses of the Baltic. Samples are being collected and analyzed routinely from several sites in the Baltic and the Kattegat areas. The results indicate that the content of oil is in most cases (about 85 percent) below the detection limit of the method, which is 0.05 mg/l. No geographical difference can be found between the two sea areas. The results obtained also indicate that the components that were analyzed were found to occur predominantly in samples representing recent production, eg of phytoplankton. Finally the results are compared with those obtained in a similar Soviet study of the pollution status of the Baltic waters. ///           ,      ,  , ,       .             . ,          ,    .          ,        ,  , ,    ,     .               .              .  ,     ( 85%)      ,   0,05 /.          .    ,       ,   ,   .  ,    ,             .
