20149653| Two of the so-called "copper mosses", Scopelophila ligulata and S. cataractae, are geographically widespread and disjunctive, but are rare throughout their ranges. The rarity of these species is generally presumed to be the result of their dependence on elevated levels of metallic ions, especially copper. Analyses of the substrates for populations of S. ligulata in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina indicate that copper is not present in abnormally high concentrations. The causes for the rarity of S. ligulata remains an unresolved problem. ///    " ", Scopelophila ligulata  S. cataractae, -     ,       .              ,   .     S. ligulata      ,         .

20150177|Excised buds from capitula containing apical meristems were used as starting material to establish shoot-tip axenic cultures of four Sphagnum species from the section Subsecunda. To find optimum conditions for rapid production of clonal gametophores, the buds were grown in various media with and without an exogenous cytokinin (BAP) and vitamins. Time of inoculation, pH, and species' differences in capacity for regeneration, were found to be critical determinants of regeneration efficiency. In this study, the buds with the highest growth rates were regenerated from S. denticulatum, followed by S. inundatum. In comparison, S. subsecundum and particularly S. contortum showed a poor response with respect to bud regeneration and growth. The species exhibit markedly different responses to pH. The differences among species may be related to species' ploidy levels. The plant material produced in vitro might be used as an abundant source of contaminant-free DNA for genetic studies. The cultivation process strongly alters the morphology of the plants, therefore they cannot be directly used for comparative morphological studies but can be used in subsequent field experiments.

20149275|Supplementary to the bryophytic flora of the cairns (Lindbergia 3: 323-331) other finds of saxicolous, oligotrafent bryophytes, occurring in the north of the Netherlands, are reported. As the granitic and other boulders -- brought here by the Riss- or Saale glaciation -- have strongly diminished in the last centuries, strictly saxicolous species are very rare nowadays. Nevertheless 2 species new to the Dutch bryophyte flora (Grimmia patens and G. hartmannii) have been found recently on boulders in coniferplantations, an environment not existing about a century ago. Other species occurring in this habitat are Racomitrium fasciculare, R. heterostichum ssp. affine, R. heterostichum var. gracilescens, R. aciculare and Grimmia decipiens. The differential characters of Grimmia trichophylla and G. decipiens are discussed and criteria are given to facilitate the identification of non-piliferous forms of Racomitrium heterostichum, R. canescens and R. lanuginosum.
20149954|The relationships between 93 species representing the Thuidiaceae, the Amblystegiaceae, and the temperate members of the Hypnaceae are evaluated using cladistic methods. These taxa have been suggested to be related to each other in an earlier overview study of the "pleurocarpous mosses", and similar suggestions have been made in other earlier published studies. Five different outgroups, Acrocladium auriculatum, Trachythecium verrucosum, Trachyphyllum inflexum, Myurium hochstetteri, and Rigodium implexum, varying from supposedly closely related groups (Acrocladium) to quite distant relatives (Rigodium) were used. The results of the present study suggest that the Thuidiaceae is a monophyletic taxon, whereas morphological and anatomical data do not support the recognition of the Amblystegiaceae or the Hypnaceae. The Thuidiaceae is circumscribed by nine gametophytic and one sporophytic character that occur only or almost only in members of this family. The Thuidiaceae clade, or, with Rigodium as outgroup, basal grade, appeared in all analyses where most of its members were included, although it had a poor Bremer and Bootstrap support. Several smaller clades have moderate to good support and / or appear in almost all analyses where their constituent species were included: (1) Lorentzia and Cyrto-hypnum atlanticum; (2) Cratoneuropsis and Palustriella; (3) Hamatocaulis and Scorpidium; (4) Calliergon, Loeskypnum, Straminergon, and Warnstorfia; (5) Caribaeohypnum and Ptilium. Also Campylophyllum halleri, C. hispidulum, Hygrohypnum montanum, H. norvegicum, Hypnum pallescens, and Hypnum recurvatum, or some of these species, were frequently found together in the analyses, but not as often as the previous five clades. Contrary to the results of the earlier analyses of the whole group of pleurocarpous mosses, of the "Hookeriales" plus Sematophyllaceae, and of the "Hookeriales", where characters of the sexual branches and the sporophyte were as important as, or more important than the gametophytic characters for the appearance of the cladogram, the latter kind of characters contributed most to the variation found between the taxa within the present group. In the present study, the number of "islands", with trees of similar length resulting from an analysis, increased with the supposed taxonomic distance between the outgroup and the ingroup.

20150005|Phenotypically deviating specimens of the pleurocarpous moss genus Dichelyma from the River Dallven in Sweden are compared with reference material of Dichelyma capillaceum (Dicks.) Myr. and D. falcatum (Hedw.) Myr. from other parts of Sweden. The phenotypes from Dallven are intermediate between the two species with respect to relative width and degree of excurrency of the costa. The specimens are also larger than typical ones of either of the two species. The intermediate specimens are close to D. falcatum in absolute width of the leaves. The leaves are longer than those of D. falcatum and in the upper range of the variation among specimens of D. capillaceum. A likely explanation for these patterns is that the specimens are of hybrid origin, but they could also be autopolyploids or strongly deviating specimens of D. capillaceum or D. falcatum.

20150009| Based on a phytosociological analysis, the terrestrial Epipterygio-Riccietum frostii, an ephemeral bryophyte community grouped within the Phascion cuspidati alliance (Barbuletalia/Barbuletea unguiculatae), is described for the first time from the Besparmak Dalari (Aegean Turkey). The community represents the characteristic open bryophyte cover of the acid sandy stream and cutbanks along the numerous brooks and rivers left exposed after the winter floods. It consists of a great number of marchantioids which mostly occur as isolated, but conspicuous rosettes. From a life strategy perspective, the community consists mainly of mat- and short turf-forming annual shuttle species, short-lived shuttle species and vegetative colonists. The survival of the community is presumably achieved by very large spores, spore tetrads and asexual propagules which are present in the diaspore bank, allowing fast re-establishment of the community over fairly large areas with the beginning of the next year.

20149885| Information is given on methods for use in the isozyme electrophoresis of Sphagnum, particularly the species of sect. Acutifolia. The main aspects of cultivation, preparation, extraction, and analysis are described. Methods are compared with protocols published for other bryophytes. Some general recommendations are given: to use young plant tissue for extraction because Sphagnum shoots are accumulating detrimental phenolic substances with age; to make as concentrated extractions as possible to improve the intensity of isozyme expression. The use of peroxidases in isozyme studies of Sphagnum is discussed. Peroxidases show both abundant phenotypic and genotypic variation and it is concluded that further genetic studies are necessary. ///     Sphagnum,    Acutifolia   .    , ,   .         .    :      ,     Sphagnum    ;         .      .    -   ,     .

20149584| Hypnum jutlandicum Holmen & Warncke usually grows as a prostrate or ascending plant in heathlands, moorlands, woodlands and conifer plantations in Ireland, Britain and Europe. It has now been discovered growing as a pendulous epiphyte on branches of Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon in a dense conifer plantation on blanket bog in Mayo, western Ireland (5412N, 945W). The moss plants are up to 10 cm in length and bedeck pine branches to 6 m above ground level. The mild, damp oceanic climate of western Ireland; the humidity within the dense tree canopy; together with an abundant supply of spores from unusually numerous sporophytes found on plants growing on the pine litter, are thought to explain the occurrence of the pendulous H. jutlandicum there. /// Hypnum jutlandicum Holmen & Warncke           ,   ,        ,     .  ,           Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon    ,      ,   (5412 N, 945 W).           6    . ,     ,             ,   ,     - -     H. jutlandicum. 
20150202|Rapid advances in the field of bryophyte population dynamics include the development of non-destructive techniques to mark and monitor individual shoots, which allowed the construction and sophisticated use of matrix models and the analysis of the consequences of fine-scale dynamics and sexual reproduction for shoot survival and growth. Dissection of turfs of desert bryophytes yielded additional evidence, as well as more detailed knowledge on phenological patterns and year-to-year variation in investments in reproduction. Studies of population dynamics at larger spatial (metapopulations) and temporal (diaspore banks) scales included experimental and modelling work on spore dispersal and on conditions favourable to spore germination and establishment, as well as extension of current metapopulation models to explicitly incorporate the dynamics of the habitable patches themselves. Together with the rapid advance of molecular techniques allowing genet recognition and the analysis of parent-offspring relations, these new developments now open the way to study the dynamics of populations of genets, which is a necessary pre-requisite for a more in-depth analysis of rates and directions of processes of natural selection and evolutionary change.

20149993|Capsules from Pogonatum dentatum, an expanding species in Fennoscandia, were collected in the field. Number of spores per capsule and the germination frequency of spores under laboratory conditions were measured. The estimated mean number of spores per capsule was 712 000. Spores were sown on Petri dishes with nutrient-rich agar and placed in a growth chamber. The number of spores germinating increased with time after sowing and reached 96.6% after 21 d. The long time needed for the spores to germinate may be due to the light and temperature regime in the growth chamber. Spores from Pogonatum dentatum, were also sown at different densities on a newly built forest road in northern Sweden. In 37 (1010 cm) blocks spores from , 1 and 2 capsules were sown. Establishment rate was estimated from the number of shoots emerging one and two years after sowing. A mean of 11, 10 and 12 shoots per block emerged after one year and 17, 20 and 22 shoots after two years, for the different sowing densities, respectively. The negative correlation between sowing density and establishment can be explained as a saturation effect, as it is likely that the spores have been sown at too high densities.
20111738|A list of all bryophytes occurring on the granitic boulders of the "hunebedden", old graves of c. 2700 B.C., and mainly occurring in the Province of Drente, is given. During the last 35 years a conspicuous impoverishment has taken place, especially of the typical saxicole, oligotrafent species. The causes of this impoverishment are discussed and advice is given for the preservation of the "hunebed"-flora. Many "hunebedden" are repaired with material rich in calcareous matter, which caused an enrichment with calciphytic species (mentioned under "B"). Of most species ecological data are given. Grimmia decipiens is reported for the first time from the Netherlands. The variability of Grimmia trichophylla and Racomitrium heterostichum is discussed. Arguments are given that R. heterostichum var. obtusum (Brid.) Delogne actually belongs to this species and not to R. aquaticum (Schrad.) Brid.

20149782| Campylium laxifolium Engelmark & Hedens, sp. nov., is described. It differs from other medium-sized, northern holarctic Campylium species in its stem leaves which are  broadly cordate-ovate at the base and gradually narrow to a long-acuminate, furrowed acumen. It differs from Campylium stellatum (Hedw.) J. Lange & C. Jens. and C. protensum (Brid.) Bryhn in being autoicous and from C. polygamum (B. S. & G.) J. Lange & C. Jens. in its quadrate, rectangular or ovate alar cell group (triangular or transversely triangular in C. polygamum) and in having a short double nerve (usually single and long in C. polygamum). Campylium longicuspis (Lindb. & H. Arn.) Hedens differs from C. laxifolium in having ovate or narrowly ovate and more strongly concave stem leaves than the latter, in having more shortly acuminate inner perichaetial leaves and in its inclined capsules. Finally, Campylium arcticum (Williams) Broth. differs from C. laxifolium in its large transverse group of alar cells in the stem leaves which extend almost from the leaf margin to the nerve with a sharp transition to the lamina cells further up the leaves. The leaf base in C. arcticum is also slightly wider and more strongly concave than in C. laxifolium. In Sweden, Campylium laxifolium occurs in rich fens of the kind where Saxifraga hirculus L. and Stellaria crassifolia Ehrh. var. paludosa Laest. are found.

Plant communities formed on alkali soil are arranged characteristically in levels closely correlated with microrelief, water regime and soil properties. Several of them have a well-developed bryophyte layer. In total, 57 taxa (two liverworts and 55 mosses) were collected in the whole investigated area -- four species included in the Red Data Book of European Bryophytes; their distribution is presented. An additional seven species are rare in Hungary. Consequently, ca 20% of the flora is rare or interesting.

20150116|This study aims to assess the taxonomic relevance of stomatal number in Ulota drummondii, U. bruchii, U. crispa and U. crispula. Six hundred and forty-nine sporophytes of 141 herbarium specimens from 17 European countries (including the Caucasus) were investigated. Stomatal number in U. drummondii is (31--) 46 (--84); in U. bruchii (6--) 17 (--40); in U. crispa (8--) 21 (--57); in U. crispula (0--) 17 (--35) (minimum, average and maximum values). The differences in mean stomatal number are statistically significant between U. drummondii and each of the taxa of the U. crispa complex, and between U. bruchii and U. crispa. In some colonies, striking and statistically significant differences in the numbers of stomata were found between consecutive years. This interannual variation is interpreted as indirect evidence for the importance of environmental factors in determining stomatal numbers. Due to its great variability, the number of stomata can only be used with caution in species identification.

27809544|The phylogeny of members of Drepanocladus and Pseudocalliergon is reconstructed based on nuclear ITS and chloroplast atpB-rbcL, trnL-trnF, rpl16 and trnG sequence data, and morphology. The total number of parsimony informative characters, was 32 (8 in the ingroup) for ITS, 47 (36) for the chloroplast markers, and 15 (13) for the morphology. The resulting trees based on the three respective data sets were partly incongruent with each other. However, all three, as well as the tree based on all information, suggest that Pseudocalliergon is nested within Drepanocladus, and nuclear, chloroplast and the total data sets in addition suggest that Pseudocalliergon is polyphyletic. The total data set yields support to two clades with a sister relationship, one clade with D. arcticus (R.S. Williams) Hedens, D. polygamus (Schimp.) Hedens, and D. latinervis Warnst., the other with the remaining Drepanocladus and Pseudocalliergon species. The Pseudocalliergon species are moved to Drepanocladus and the new combination Drepanocladus angustifolius (Hedens) Hedens & C. Rosborg is made for the species so far called P. angustifolium Hedens. Cratoneuropsis is unlikely to be a member of Drepanocladus as here re-defined, but wider studies are needed to find its correct relationships among the Amblystegiaceae.

lindbergia.34.2|As sensitive indicators of environmental change, many bryophytes are particularly threatened by the degradation of habitats. A long term re-sampling study of bryophyte flora was conducted in springs in southeast Finland, in which the species occupancy and abundance, as well as the degree of human disturbance, of 60 springs were reinvestigated after a period of 50 years. A significant decrease was observed in the spring specialist species' occupancy and abundance, and bryophytes of spring-fed rich fens were found to have become regionally even rarer and locally less abundant than other spring specialists. The negative reaction of least concern (LC) species raises concern regarding the future of even common spring and rich fen bryophytes. The increase of human disturbance was found to poorly explain the observed negative changes and it was inferred that they are mainly caused by the almost total destruction of springs with rich fen characteristics. Thus, the protection of groundwater influenced rich fens independent of their degree of human disturbance is essential to the future of many specialized spring bryophytes.

20149599| Platydictya jungermannioides (Brid.) Crum, the only representative of the genus in Greenland, is more common and variable than previously recognized. Its geographic distribution correlates with the general occurrence of alkaline subsoil; this distribution type is shared by about 7% of the moss species in Greenland; northward, populations appear geographically clustered to three regions suggesting suboptimal dispersal during the Holocene. Sporophytes of P. jungermannioides are unknown from Greenland; dispersal takes place by means of propagules. /// Platydictya jungermannioides (Brid.)

20149860| Lophocolea semiteres is relatively common in acid heaths and pine plantations of the Campine region of Belgium and The Netherlands and occurs in two sites in Dutch acid coastal dunes. It grows on soil, litter, dead logs and as an epiphyte. It has frequently been confused with L. heterophylla, but can be recognized by its dioecious condition, rounded, emarginate, rarely bilobed leaves and large, deeply divided, laciniate underleaves which are narrowly connate with the lateral leaf base. Male and female populations show different distribution patterns, suggesting separate introductions. In contrast to the situation in the British Isles, no clear relation between introduction and old gardens could be detected. It is presumed that L. semiteres will show the same invasive behaviour as Orthodontium lineare and Campylopus introflexus. /// Lophocolea semiteres                         .    , ,     .

20149557| Stenodictyon is a neotropical genus of three species: S. wrightii, S. pallidum, and S. bisodalense sp. nov. The genus belongs in the Hookeriaceae as evidenced by its hookeriaceous peristome. Within the family, an evaluation of gametophytic characters indicates an affinity to the hookeriopsoid group: specifically Hookeriopsis. Stenodictyon saxicola is transferred to Hookeriopsis. Stenodictyon sericeum and S. nitidum are synonymous with S. wrightii, the most widespread and variable species of the genus (Costa Rica to Ecuador). Stenodictyon pallidum is restricted to the West Indies and appears to be most closely related to S. bisodalense, which is known only from Costa Rica. Uniseriate gemmae, not previously known in the genus, have been found in some collections to S. wrightii and S. bisodalense. The Philibert-Dixon principle, which relies on peristomal characters to draw broad lines of classifications, provides the best approximation of a natural classification for the Hookeriaceae. /// Stenodictyon   ,     : S. wrightii, S. pallidum,  S. bisodalense . .

20149382| A review of the nomenclatural history of some species of Pohlia Hedw. indicates that authors from the time of Dillenius until the present day have applied specific epithets in various manners. Leers and Hedwig first used propagula in their circumscription of Bryum annotinum, and the name can be typified from plants in the Hedwig-Schwaegrichen herbarium. The correct name for this species is Pohlia annotina (Hedw.) Lindb. Webera rothii Corr. in Limpr. was published as a nomen novum for W. erecta A. Roth ex Corr., but an isotype of the latter name is considered taxonomically synonomous with Pohlia filum (Schimp.) Mrt. The name Pohlia andalusica (Hhn.) Broth. is the earliest valid combination for the plant known to recent authors as P. rothii. Webera commutata Schimp. was superfluous when published.

20149425| In Bryum coronatum Schwaegr., a widespread species producing sporophytes freely in Nigeria, about 42% of the sporophytes had undehisced capsules, even during the dry season when mosses normally discharge their spores. About 41% of the setae had no capsules. Whether the loss of capsules constitutes a waste or is a dispersal mechanism is not known for certain. Spore germination was rather good (65-88%) but protonemal growth was abnormal. It is suggested that the spreading of B. coronatum by spores is limited in nature. The numerous axillary propagules may play an important role in dispersal. ///   Bryum coronatum Schwaegr.,        ,  42     ,     ,      .  41     .     ,      -   .

20149834| To determine the effect of macroclimate and habitat on leaf characters, the length and shape of stem and branch leaves of Sphagnum strictum from herbarium specimens covering all parts of the species' distribution in Norway, were observed and measured. The measurements were related to interpolated macroclimatic data by stepwise multiple regression. Similar measurements on branch leaves were obtained from 71 plots of S. strictum at eight localities, and the morphological data were related to vegetation data from the plots. A shift from short branch leaves which are narrow above towards long and broad ones was observed along a regional gradient from south and southwest and lowland sites, towards north and subalpine ones. This shift in morphology was also observed along the vegetational gradient: pine woodland -- heath -- mire fen hummock -- mire fen lawn. Both studies support the hypothesis that short branch leaves with an involute portion above might have an adaptive significance in retaining water of Sphagnum strictum living in fairly dry habitats with warm summers, and where capillary movement of subsoil water can be difficult. ///         ,        Sphagnum strictum   ,       ,    .           .        71  S. strictum   ,          .     ,                -    ,     .          :   -   -   -  .    ,                Sphagnum strictum,        ,         . 
20149401| To the bryophyte flora of Lanzarote (Canary Islands) 38 species can be added, yielding a total of 76 species; Bryum gemmilucens, Phascum cuspidatum, Pottia davalliana, Weisia longifolia and Riccia cavernosa are new to the Canaries. Morphology and variability of a few species are discussed, including Trichostomum brachydontium Bruch var. robustum (Ren. & Card.) comb. nov. In the flora of Lanzarote, common European and Mediterranean elements are predominant, and Macaronesian and Atlantic elements are remarkably scarce. The bryophyte vegetation can be classified into 7 clearly definable synusiae, belonging to the unions Fabronietum pusillae, Grimmietum campestris-commutatae, Crossidietum, and Fissidento-Funarietum curvisetae nom. nov.; the last union is divided into 3 new subunions. Some relevs represent fragments of the Abietinello-Pleurochaetetum. Ecology, altitudinal distribution on Lanzarote, diversity, life strategy composition, and syntaxonomy of each synusia are discussed. Species richness is lowest in epilithic stands, highest on the most mesic sites. Most life strategies show markedly different distributions over communities and ecological factors; however, the colonist group occurs nearly everywhere, reflecting the yet heterogeneous character of this category. Patterns in species diversity and life strategy distributions strongly suggest, that stress through lack of water and high vapour pressure deficits is the dominant ecological factor for bryophytes on Lanzarote. ///     ( )   38 ,     76 ; Bryum gemmilucens, Phascum cuspidatum, Pottia davalliana, Weisia longifolia  Riccia cavernosa     .      ,    Trichostomum brachydontium Bruch var. robustum (Ren. & Card.) comb. nov.     7 ,    Fabronietum pusillae, Grimmietum campestris-commutatae, Crossidietum,  Fissidento-Funarietum curvisetae nom. nov.;     3  .

20149572| Forsstroemia trichomitria (Hedw.) Lindb. exhibits cyclic patterns of vegetative and reproductive growth. Approximately 4 mm of secondary stem elongation occurs annually, divided into branched (vegetative) and unbranched (reproductive) portions. Growth intervals are defined by the series of adjacent lateral vegetative branches. Distribution of inflorescences is highly variable, with a trend toward gonioautoicy. About five inflorescences are produced per year, and development of antheridia and archegonia is generally synchronous. The interval of fertilization occurs in late summer through autumn, lasting about four months. Ninety percent of all mature perichaetia include at least one fertilized archegonium; multiple fertilizations per perichaetium are frequent. Significantly more archegonia abort in fertilized perichaetia than in unfertilized perichaetia. One sporophyte develops per perichaetium, and takes about 17 months to reach maturity, requiring successive winters. As a result, two generations of living sporophytes may be present along the same stem for several months. Upon fertilization, paraphyses and perichaetial leaves expand, reaching full size prior to termination of the embryonic phase. /// Forsstroemia trichomitria (Hedw.)

20149999|All Iberian specimens of this genus were revised, and the following taxa were recognised: Bazzania flaccida (Dumort.) Grolle, B. tricrenata (Wahlenb.) Lindb., B. trilobata (L.) Gray and B. trilobata var. depauperata (Mll. Frib.) Grolle. An identification key is presented for these taxa, and morphological characters allowing for distinction between the three species are tabulated. The distribution of each species on the Iberian Peninsula is mapped and illustrations are presented. B. flaccida, previously seldom cited, was found to be rather frequent from the Cantabrian range to the eastern Pyrenees. It had previously been misidentified as B. tricrenata, B. denudata (Torrey ex Gottsche) Trevis. and B. trilobata var. depauperata. B. tricrenata is very rare, and was found only in central Pyrenees and at another isolated locality in Navarra. The distribution of B. trilobata, the most frequent species in the genus, ranges from Navarra to Galicia, Sintra being the only Portuguese reference available; its variety depauperata appeared only once, in Guipzcoa.
20149967|In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 616 species of bryophytes are recorded. Endemism is low compared with the vascular flora. Only 11 taxa have been treated as local endemics, but all except one are now regarded as synonyms of more widespread taxa. Encalypta serbica retains its endemic status, although as a taxonomically doubtful taxon. Of the Red Listed bryophytes of Europe, 37 moss and 5 liverwort species are present in F. R. Yugoslavia. Five of these are endemic to Europe including Macaronesia. To date, no measures of bryophyte protection have been taken in F. R. Yugoslavia. However, the major centres of bryophyte diversity are situated in Scientific Reserves, Nature Conservation Reserves and National Parks.
27809541|Leptodontium pusillum is described and illustrated as a new species from Argentina.

20150138|The "thatch moss", Leptodontium gemmascens, is a rare species in western Europe, where it is confined to decaying vegetation. Most records are from old thatched roofs and the apparent decline of the species in recent years has been attributed to increasing rarity of thatched roofs in suitable decay stages. Here we document a cluster of populations in Somerset that more than doubles the known number of localities for this species in the UK. We also investigate the occurrence and abundance of L. gemmascens in relation to the roof variables thatch age, aspect and thatch type. LOESS and cubic spline regressions reveal a strong association between thatch age and the probability of L. gemmascens being present, with roofs in the 10-15 year old age classes being especially likely to have the moss. The basis of this association needs further investigation. A negative association between abundance and age, for roofs on which thatch moss was present, is weak and only marginally significant. There is no detectable association between occurrence of L. gemmascens, or its abundance, and either aspect or thatch type. These outcomes have significant implications for conservation of the thatch moss both in the UK and globally, and we outline a programme of further research necessary for effective management of the species.
20150057|The distributions in Finland of Zygodon conoideus, Z. rupestris and Z. viridissimus, are mapped. Z. conoideus has been collected only once from land (Al) over 100 years ago and it is probably extinct there. Recent records of Z. conoideus come from ultramafic rocks in the biogeographical provinces of Kb, Ok, Obo, Obu, and introduce a substantial increase in its Fennoscandian distribution and habitat range. Material of Z. rupestris and Z. viridissimus from Finland has been revised. Some specimens of Z. viridissimus were erroneously included in Z. rupestris. The gemmae characteristics, especially the presence/absence of longitudinal septa, can be used reliably to distinguish these two species. There are ca ten recent records of Z. viridissimus from calcareous rocks and its range extends to northeastern Finland. Z. rupestris has many new records from southern Finland, and two from northern Finland.
20149651| By means of six permanent plots, each 20  20 cm, recorded on average once in three months, early bryophyte succession was followed in the period 1981-1986 on two steep slopes in two Dutch forests. In these plots the existing bryophyte vegetation was removed in 1980 together with 0.5 cm topsoil. The original vegetation consisted of about eight bryophyte species without any phanerogams. Colonization during the first years was mainly by Colonist mosses with large diaspore production. Perennial mosses never reached high cover values. Gradually liverworts invaded and surpassed the mosses in cover. After the first year of establishment diversity in the plots remained constant during most of the time, probably due to very fine-scale disturbances. Establishment of new species in the plots appeared not to be influenced by the populations that were already present, and thus the succession in the plots conforms well to a 'tolerance' model. ///     ,    20  20 ,         ,         1981-1986 .    ,  ,     .          1980 .     ,   0, 5 .          -  .     ,  ,  -    .         . -       .              ,     .      , -,       ,          "". 
20149742| A survey was made of the bryophytes of the young woods in the Noordoostpolder, E.- and S.-Flevoland. These polders were reclaimed in the former IJsselmeer, in the period 1942 - 1968. A variety of tree species were planted on peat, boulder clay, sand and clay deposits. From 1973 onwards 18 production woods and some nature reserves have been surveyed for their bryophyte flora. A total of 216 species were recorded, including first records for The Netherlands of Distichium inclinatum, Pterigynandrum filiforme, Rhytidiadelphus subpinnatus, Plagiomnium medium and Ulota drummondii. Records of species that have been absent for many decades in the Netherlands include Eurhynchium angustirete, Atrichum angustatum, Orthotrichum rupestre and O. speciosum. Plantations of Fraxinus on sand, boulder clay and partially eroded peat are particularly rich in species. Ditches provide habitats for many additional species in these and other woodland types. Plantations of Salix and Populus can be rich in epiphytic species depending on soil type, moisture and planted cultivar. Locations with strong seepage can also be rich in species. The species richness of the various woods is correlated with the area. The importance of age is shown for some stand/soil types. At the level of permanent plots it is shown that establishment is still going on, but at different rates in the various stand/soil types. Nearly 40% of the mosses do not (or very rarely) produce spores in The Netherlands. Some of these may have invaded the woods by their asexual propagules. A significant part of these species will have been dispersed from areas where they produce sporophytes more abundantly, such as mountainous areas of Middle Europe. We speculate that subsequent terrestrial establishment possibilities in the woods were favourable in comparison with the "old land" due to low levels of competition with other plants. ///           .       /.     ,     ,        /.  40%     (    )  .   ,       .       ,       ,      .

20150218|The objective of this work is to provide an updated threatened and endangered status of all bryophytes in the Iberian territory and also to provide a checklist for Portugal, Spain and Andorra. With respect to these species, the recent IUCN criteria are used for evaluation in the respective categories. There are a total of 1101 known Iberian bryophytes (811 mosses and 290 hepatics including 6 hornworts), with 369 of these taxa on the Red List (33.5%). There are 10 Regionally Extinct taxa comprised of 7 mosses and 3 hepatics; 16 Critically Endangered taxa comprised of 11 mosses and 5 hepatics; 40 Endangered taxa comprised of 26 mosses and 14 hepatics; 114 Vulnerable taxa comprised of 83 mosses and 31 hepatics; 26 Near Threatened taxa comprised of 11 mosses and 15 hepatics. Of the Non-Threatened categories, there are 732 Least Concern taxa, which include 21 on the Attention list (18 mosses and 3 hepatics). In addition, 163 taxa are considered to be Data Deficient (DD and DD-va) with DD-n including the new taxa or new references for the Iberian Peninsula.
20149465| Porella hattorii sp. nov. is described from the W. Himalayas, India.

20149590| Lethocolea Mitt., a marsupial genus, has been discovered for the first time in the Indian subcontinent from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The specimens belong to L. javanica (Schiffn.) Grolle previously only known from Java. The gemmae are ca. 8 cells across, but germinating ones become larger, thus resembling those of other Lethocolea species. The oil-bodies of L. javanica, described here for the first time, are deep brown (yellowish-brown in L. glossophylla and L. congesta). /// Lethocolea Mitt.,  ,          .    L. javanica (Schiffn.)

The tubers, identical to those known in P. intermedia (Turn.) Fuernr., are illustrated and described. Tubers and rhizoid fragments are effective means of vegetative propagation.
20149604|In (especially young) ditches in the surroundings of Eindhoven, more than 106 mosses and 43 liverworts were found, among which the locally rare species Pleuridium palustre, Sphaerocarpos texanus and Jungermannia caespiticia. Representative species of the Bryum erythrocarpum --, B. bicolor -- and Pohlia annotina complexes are common in almost every ditch as well as Ditrichum spp. Ditrichum cylindricum was found with mature capsules for the first time in the Netherlands. Ditches seem to be a refugium for several bryophytes, which were common on arable land before the intensive agriculture took place.

20150194|Isothecium holtii has been regarded as a good species, a dubious species, or as a. variety of either I. alopecuroides or I. myosuroides. Its distribution range includes the British Isles, western France and western Norway, with disjunct occurrences in central Europe and Turkey. A molecular study was designed to clarify the taxonomic position of this taxon, as well as to assess whether the disjunct populations in Germany are a result of recent migration or whether they are relicts of a wider distribution from more humid climatic periods. The analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences (internal transcribed spacer [ITS] 1/2) revealed that Isothecium holtii is a good species, and that it is more closely related to I. myosuroides than to I. alopecuroides. The disjunct populations in Germany are heterogeneous. Two clusters are found with different populations in western Europe, indicating independent dispersal events, whereas another is genetically isolated, indicating a long separation and a relict population. The populations in Brittany and the Massif Central are genetically related but are rooted with the populations from Britain and Ireland, indicating that they are relicts of a formerly continuous range.
20150077|Bryophyte-environment relationships were explored with multivariate methods and the emerging patterns were compared to corresponding environmental gradients of importance to vascular plants. The analysis was based on records of moss, liverwort, lichen and vascular plant species in 160 plots of 10 m2 covering a range from acidic to calcareous grasslands on different soil types and different slopes and aspects. An ordination of the cryptogam subset was compared with an ordination of the vascular plants from the same plots. Cryptogams were found to respond largely to the same major gradients as vascular plants. Possible explanations and implications are discussed. The 17 most frequent cryptogams were modelled in terms of the two most predictive environmental dimensions, and the validity of the models was tested by cross-validation. Models for ten species passed the validation criterion and these models are presented in the form of contour diagrams. Both specialist and generalist species were found.

20149293| Samples of epiphytic Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. from the trunks of Tilia cordata, Alnus glutinosa, Fagus silvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur and Betula pubescens, and samples of the bark of the respective phorophytes, were analysed for Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, V and Zn by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The highest levels of elements were found in bark and epiphytic moss of trees with a bark with high values of conductivity, pH and buffer capacity. No simple relation was found between the element content of the bark and the epiphytic moss, although in a few cases extreme values in the bark -- both high and low -- were reflected in the moss also. It is pointed out that epiphytic mosses are applicable only as monitoring organisms for the atmospheric deposition of elements, when the methodical variations can be eleminated by steeper environmental gradients or temporal variations. ///   Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw.

20150152|Bryophytes are can alter species composition in grassland communities, for example by affecting juvenile stages of grasses and other vascular plants, but their effect on spatial structure and on demography of established plants is less known. Therefore we studied effects of bryophytes on the spatial structure of a mountain grassland community using a bryophyte removal experiment, combined with fertilization. Spatial and temporal autocorrelations were measured using Moran I and tested with ANOVA. Fine-scale community response to removal was tested using redundancy analysis and a randomization test. Bryophyte removal affected patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelations in some species and thus had an effect on the fine scale structure of the grassland. In particular, species with high ramet turnover (Anthoxanthum alpinum and Deschampsia flexuosa) responded positively to bryophyte removal in cells with high initial bryophyte density. In contrast to bryophyte removal, fertilization had no detectable effect on fine-scale spatial pattern, of either bryophytes or vascular plants. The removal experiment shows that bryophytes are not only passive gap-filling species, but that they may also actively contribute to formation of patches with lower ramet density of vascular plants.

20149435| Three hundred Hylocomium splendens sympodia were sampled from each of five coniferous forest sites 2.5-12 km north of a brass foundry in Sweden. Long annual segments tended to bear long daughter segments (r = 0.23-0.54***). Most branching occurred from long segment stems. The average multiple daughter segment was 3-16% shorter than the average single segment. Up to four (av. 1.18) daughter segments were formed from each segment. Neither the frequency of branching nor the chlorophyll content were influenced by heavy metal pollution. In moss with Cu and Zn concentrations of up to about 10 and 8 times the respective regional background level, length and weight were not affected. At 17 and 10 times the respective background level, the segments were 30-33% shorter and 50-65% lighter and biomass was reduced by 54%.

20149580| Fragments of seven mosses, including Climacium dendroides and Fontinalis flaccida, have been recovered from early postglacial lake sediments in southeastern Labrador. Tundra vegetation persisted during deposition of these sediments. Salix, Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and herbs were abundant from 10,500 to 9500 years BP, while a subsequent shrub zone (to 8000 yr BP) was dominated by Betula and Alnus pollen. Fontinalis flaccida is an eastern North American endemic occurring as far north as Ontario to Newfoundland, but it has not been reported from Labrador. In contrast, C. dendroides has a circumboreal distribution, and extant eastern North American populations occur as far south as Iowa to New York. The co-occurrence of these two species in Labrador during early postglacial times is evidence that both boreal and temperate taxa were able to survive in the vicinity of Wisconsinan land ice. ///   ,  Climacium dendroides  Fontinalis flaccida,        -  .        .

20149987|The occurrence of the expanding species Pogonatum dentatum in the diaspore bank of forest roads ranging from newly built to more than 10 years old is studied in northern Sweden. Spatial distribution is investigated by taking soil samples at distances from 0.05 m to 50 m from colonies, on forest roads of 4 and 9-10 years age. The presence of P. dentatum is compared with the presence of Pogonatum urnigerum, which is naturally occurring in the same habitat in the study area. P. dentatum is most frequent at the youngest roads (0-4 years old), whereas P. urnigerum shows a preference for the older roads (more than 4 years old). The spatial distribution of P. dentatum in the diaspore bank shows a decreasing frequency with distance from parent colonies on both of the roads investigated (4 and 9-10 years old).
20149529|The striking decline of the bryophyte flora of the Dutch megalithic tombs in the last decade was the reason for a new inventory in 1982-1983. Since 1968-1969 six species have disappeared (Barbilophozia barbata, Lophozia ventricosa, Andreaea rothii, Grimmia decipiens, Mniobryum wahlenbergii and Pleurozium schreberi). One new species has been found, Aulacomnium androgynum. On the concrete used to repair the tombs however the number of species increased from 16 to 25, all common and calciphytic. The few localities left of some very rare species are threatened. To prevent extinction, some tombs should be fenced and some should be exposed to full daylight again by cutting some surrounding trees.

20150041|The relation between population patch dynamics and the species-environmental relationship approach in conservation bryology is discussed. Since patch suitability is defined by the species-environmental relationship, these two modelling approaches are not mutually exclusive but complementary. It has been shown that variables relating to patch dynamics are important for describing patterns when distances between suitable patches are large, i.e. at a broad spatial scale. This paper shows that at a fine scale, i.e. with short distance between patches, the spatial distribution of the environmental conditions highly influences the distribution of the species within the study area. Thus there is a scale-related connection between these models which should be implemented in more complex models in addition to species-environmental relationships and patch dynamics.
20149835| Direct and indirect effects of eutrophication on phanerogam biomass (and litter), availability of daylight at the bryophyte layer and nutrient concentrations in the water were studied in relation to the replacement of the rich-fen bryophyte species Scorpidium scorpioides by Calliergonella cuspidata, characteristic of more eutrophic habitats. Field measurements, carried out in five mires containing both species in Denmark, Ireland and the Netherlands, showed that in habitats of S. scorpioides phanerogam biomass was lower, light penetration was larger and P levels in the water were lower than in habitats with C. cuspidata. Experimental fertilization with P and NP in two S. scorpioides fens in Ireland and the Netherlands resulted in increased phanerogam biomass and decreased light availability. Supply of N had no effect. This suggests that rich fens with S. scorpioides are P-limited. Increased availability of nutrients (especially P) may directly or via increased phanerogam biomass, and thus reduced availability of daylight, regulate the replacement of S. scorpioides by C. cuspidata, but further studies under more controlled conditions are needed. ///         ( ),                "-"   Scorpidium scorpioides  Calliergonella cuspidata,     .  ,    ,     ,   ,     S. scorpioides    ,           ,     C. cuspidata.

20150099|A number of acrocarpous, unisexual mosses have anatomical features that seem to facilitate fertilization -- splash-cups on male shoots and a tuft of specialized leaves on female shoots. Spermatozoids are thought to travel with droplets from raindrop splashes in splash-cups to female gametangia. A video film of splashes in splash-cups of Plagiomnium affine during a rain captured a few full hits and several partial hits. On impact a "crown" of water is formed. On the rim of this crown small droplets are propelled away. This is a common and well-investigated type of splash phenomenon in the hydrodynamic literature and agrees best with drop hits on a wet, rough surface. The club-shaped paraphyses are taller than the antheridia, their swollen heads forming the splash-cup bottom. During a shower, water fills the capillary spaces between antheridia and paraphyses up to the bottom of the splash-cup. For a hitting drop to have space to develop a crown, its diameter should be 1 mm or less, as shown in the film. Such drops are common in most showers. The impact of drops on the splash-cup causes ripe antheridia to rupture, and the spermatozoids reach the bottom of the splash-cup via narrow passages between the paraphyseal heads. The crown incorporates water from the splash-cup bottom, and, thus comes to include spermatozoids that finally reach the droplets. Together with the fact that most female gametangia are fertilized around a single male gametangium, this constitutes strong indirect evidence that spermatozoids actually travel with the droplets. Droplets can travel 100 mm or more, and most or all female gametangia within ca 80 mm are fertilized. The time of fertilization in P. affine in southwestern Sweden is ca 3 weeks -- from the last week in June to the middle of July.
20150142|Recent collections of mosses from Dakhla and Kharga Oases (western desert of Egypt) have resulted in an increase in the number of mosses known from the former oasis from three to five and in the report of 10 mosses, for the first time, from the latter oasis. The moss flora of each oasis is distinct from the other and together they show more ties with Sinai and northern Africa than with the Nile region. The total number of mosses for the oases territory is increased from four to 14 and that of Egypt from 170 to 173.
20150207|Oceanic islands are available to bryophytes almost exclusively by long range air dispersal. The colonization of these islands is a long lasting and ongoing process, depending a great deal on the available amount of airborne propagules and on the size and distance of the donor and recipient areas. The flux density as expressed by the immigration index of MacArthur and Wilson and several other factors that influence successful colonization, such as competitive ability, the genetic properties and the saturation level of island biomes, are discussed in this context. Adaptive radiation has special significance in oceanic island evolution. Phylogeography, using DNA sequencing, parsimony and maximum likelihood analysis to obtain more exact data on the origin, evolutionary and migratory history of living organisms has introduced a new era in the study of island colonization. The author's own observations on the great significance of migration sequence for the colonization process are described and an equation to describe the relationship is proposed. The presence or lack of different taxonomic groups on different islands of the same archipelago can be explained most probably by migration sequence. The "antenna phenomenon", which is the importance of emergent, partly open habitats in capturing airborne propagules during the colonization process and the dissemination of taxa, is a new concept in island biogeography.

20149812| Dicranum tauricum is a rare species in Fennoscandia except on the Swedish island Gotland. In Finland the species is restricted to the coastal area in the southeast and to the land Islands. The few localities on the Swedish mainland are in the south. In Denmark it is known from the island Bornholm and two localities in Jutland. In Norway it is also rare but widespread. The northernmost localities are in Talvik, north of the polar circle, and on the Svalbard Islands. Vegetative specimens of D. tauricum can be distinguished easily from the habitually similar and in the distribution somewhat overlapping D. fragilifolium by the cross section of the leaf costa, which has hydroids in D. tauricum, but not in D. fragilifolium. /// Dicranum tauricum     ,      .       -   .        .              .     ,   .           ,    .

20149800| The bryophyte flora of 16 volcanic caves in the Azores includes 31 hepatics and 30 mosses while that of 19 caves in the Canary Islands includes 10 hepatics and 42 mosses. Only species that also occur in the archipelagoes outside the caves were found. Oceanic (Azores) and oceanic-mediterranean (Canary Islands) species are the most abundant chorological types in the caves. Among life strategies, Fugitives and Shuttle species are absent or very poorly represented; nearly all species have the Colonist or Perennial stayer life strategy. Many species that elsewhere behave as Colonists do not reproduce sexually and do not produce asexual propagules in the cave environment, thereby behaving as Perennials. Nearly everywhere, Perennials dominate in the inner, dimly and indirectly illuminated parts of the caves (transition zones); Colonists are particularly abundant in the entrance zones of caves in drier and more exposed environments. ///          31   30 ,             10   42 .    ,     .

20149232|All samples of the genus Plagiochila from the Netherlands, present in the main Dutch institutional herbaria and some private collections have been reexamined. Several specimens turned out to belong to P. porelloides, a species which had been recorded only once before from the Netherlands. Distribution maps are given for both species. They can be distinguished as follows: P. asplenioides: dried plants pale green; stem-length 3-7 cm, stem-width 5-9 mm; cells thin-walled, without trigones; cuticula smooth. P. porelloides: dried plants yellow-green to dark-green; stem-length up to 3 cm, stem-width 2-4 mm; cells with more or less conspicuous trigones, cells of the leaf-border thick-walled; cuticula mamillose.

20150081|On the basis of collections made in 1983 and 1986, we report 83 liverwort taxa from the Nachvak Fjord -- Ramah Bay region of the Torngat Mountains, northern Labrador. Of these, 39 taxa (47%), including 33 species, two sub-species and four varieties have not previously been recorded for Labrador. The record of Lophozia debiliformis Schust. and Damsh. represents an addition to the Canadian flora. While many of the species in the flora are widespread boreal and arctic species, a high proportion are much rarer, including a significant element comprising species with major disjunctions in their northern hemisphere distributions. These elements may represent recent long-distance dispersal or local persistence in refugia throughout previous glacial epochs; the data available at present do not permit tests of these hypotheses. Whatever their origins, the presence of a large proportion of nationally and globally rare hepatic taxa renders the region of very high conservation value.
20149556| Fissidens florschuetzii Pursell, sp. nov., from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in the Department of Magdalena in northern Colombia is described and illustrated.

A Gondwanalandic origin of the family is assumed. Of the three subfamilies accepted, Geocalycoideae and Lophocoleoideae include a number of Laurasian taxa; the Leptoscyphoideae are purely Gondwanalandic, aside from 1 sp.

The genera are circumscribed, and their nomenclature and taxonomic relationships are clarified. Rigodiadelphus is the correct name for the genus that Fleischer and Brotherus called Lesquereuxia. It belongs to the Leskeaceae near Lescuraea. Ptychodium is placed in the Thuidiaceae near Pseudoleskea. Hylocomium indicum Dix. is transferred to Ptychodium as P. indicum (Dix.) Rohrer, comb. nov. Okamuraea is assigned to the Leucodontaceae. An analysis of variance shows that the three species of the O. hakoniensis (Mitt.)

20150217| Trematodon ambiguus, a species until recently considered extinct in Belgium and the Netherlands, has reappeared in a number of localities in the last two decades, usually after a large-scale disturbance such as extensive cutting of sods. However, it always disappears from these sites within a few years of its reappearance. In almost all cases, the sites have been characterized by upwelling of well-buffered ground water and a mildly acid, loamy soil. We have hypothesized that, in most sites, the species was re-established from a long-lived spore bank in the soil, based on its spore size (ca 30 m), the relatively small number of spores per capsule (ca 14 000), and the emergence of plants of the species from soil samples taken at a depth of 0-3 (occasionally up to 6) cm in two Dutch localities. The increase in abundance of T. ambiguus may be related to the recent expansion of the use of sod cutting as a conservation management tool.

20149824| A transplantation experiment was carried out with four bryophyte species, characteristic of different successional stages in mesotrophic mires (Scorpidium scorpioides and Sphagnum subnitens) and eutrophic mires (Calliergonella cuspidata and Sphagnum squarrosum). Each species was grown in its own habitat and in each of three other habitats, located in a mesotrophic fen or a eutrophic floating fen in the Netherlands. The mineral-rich fen habitats had a higher pH value and higher mineral levels than the Sphagnum habitats. In the more eutrophic habitats of C. cuspidata and S. squarrosum, concentrations of ammonium and phosphate were higher than in the mesotrophic habitats of S. scorpioides and S. subnitens. Whereas the latter species habitats differed considerably in water chemistry, C. cuspidata and S. squarrosum habitats were not different in chloride and sodium and only slightly in calcium. The mineral-rich fen species S. scorpioides and C. cuspidata grew poorly in the habitats of their Sphagnum successors. Conversely, growth of S. subnitens was stunted in the habitat of its predecessor S. scorpioides. However, S. squarrosum showed very high growth rates in the habitat of C. cuspidata. It is suggested that establishment of S. subnitens only occurs after changes in water chemistry, i.e., the local accumulation of rain water in a formerly mineral-rich fen. Sphagnum squarrosum may establish in an earlier phase of succession, in water which is still rather rich in minerals, and changes in water chemistry may be the result rather than a cause of the presence of this species. ///        ,         (Scorpidium scorpioides  Sphagnum subnitens)    (Calliergonella cuspidata  Sphagnum squarrosum).             ,           .         pH        Sphagnum.

20150044|Seven sites with high diversity of bryophytes have been chosen to represent the bryoflora of Estonia. Almost all vegetation types and habitats of Estonia are included in these sites. Sixteen species belonging to the Red Data Book of European Bryophytes and 73 species belonging to the Red Data Book of Estonia have been found at these sites.
20150076|A comparison of two recent inventories of cryptogams in dry semi-natural grasslands with three inventories made in the period 1945-1955 revealed significant differences with respect to species richness as well as frequency of single species. Two generalist bryophytes, Brachythecium rutabulum and Ceratodon purpureus, were more frequent in the recent data set whereas two specialist bryophytes, Abietinella abietina and Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus, were more frequent in the old data set. Within the dry calcifugous grasslands a higher lichen species richness was found in the old data set, whereas in dry calcareous grasslands the recent data set had a higher moss species richness. The trends found in this study are compared to the reported impoverishment of the cryptogam flora of Dutch and British chalk grasslands. Although changes over the last 50 years may have occurred, remnant patches of unimproved semi-natural grasslands in Denmark still have a species-rich cryptogam flora.
20149970|During recent bryological studies in the area of the Serra da Estrela Natural Park in central Portugal, we have found several localities for Bruchia vogesiaca Schwaegr. A critical morphological analysis of the new Portuguese material provides significant new data on the morphology and life strategy of this rare species. Besides additional information on the ecology of the new sites and suggestions for habitat management in the park, a detailed map of its distribution area in Europe is given.
20149765|The identification of over 10000 bryophyte samples collected by field botanists in the province of Zuid-Holland provided valuable information of the distribution of 15 taxa. Most are reported here for the first time from that province. The records are especially interesting because they are mainly from cultivated areas, not nature reserves.
20150047|Several of Slovakia's bryophyte species are rare due to shortage of suitable habitats such as wetlands (mainly fens or wooded fens, e.g. Pseudobryum cinclidioides, Paludella squarrosa), forest habitats with decaying logs (e.g. Scapania massalongi), spruce bogs (Hookeria lucens), and salt-rich soils (e.g. Entosthodon hungaricus). Some moss species occupy rather specialized niches, e.g. some high-altitude species (e.g. Marsupella sparsifolia), epiphytes (e.g. Frullania fragilifolia), lithophytes (e.g. Seligeria oelandica), and submerged species (e.g. Cinclidotus aquaticus) and others. Apart from natural succession, agricultural and forestry practices, habitat destruction and air and water pollution are thought to be responsible for the changes in species abundance or even extinction in some locations. The distribution of some glacial relic moss species is presented.
20150095|Lophocolea fragrans is reported new to Germany from two different localities. The ecological conditions of the two sites are characterized and a short description of the most important identification features of the species is given. Lophocolea fragrans will probably be found in similar habitats in the western and more oceanic part of Germany, especially in gorges and ravines with high humidity and more or less constant temperatures.

20149927|Anthoceros caucasicus Steph., a mediterranean-atlantic species occurring mainly in Macaronesia and at isolated localities in the Iberian Peninsula, Italy and the Caucasus, was collected in 1924 in the vicinity of Denekamp in The Netherlands, and refound in 1994 at a locality near the previous one. The Dutch specimens have strongly lamellose thalli, like those from the Caucasus; they seem to be dioecious, while elsewhere the species is monoecious.

It was formerly known only from Turkestan (U.S.S.R.). ///  Tortula grandiretis Broth.,   T. muralis Hedw.    ,    ,      - ,     ,             .        .         (). 
20150234|A minimum of two hornworts, ten hepatics and twenty-two mosses emerged, often in large numbers, from superficial soil samples taken from the 'Matopos Sandveld Fire Plots' in the savanna of S. Zimbabwe. Many of the species found were hypothesized to take advantage of an 'episodic' strategy much like that described for Physcomitrium sphaericum in the UK. Perhaps because species that employ this strategy are so seldom present above ground, the assemblage contained several species new to Africa, or new to Zimbabwe, including Micromitrium tenerum, as well as one recently described new taxon, Neophoenix matoposensis. Annual burning of the above-ground vegetation did not appear to be harmful to the diaspores in the soil.
20149391| Breutelia elongata, an Australasian species, can now be reported with certainty from southern South America. Its similarities to B. plicata are discussed.

20149988|The genus Homalothecium Schimper is revised on a worldwide scale. It comprises eight species and two subspecies: H. arenarium (Lesq.) Lawt., H. aureum (Spruce) Robins., H. laevisetum Lac., H. lutescens (Hedw.) Robins. subsp. lutescens, H. l. subsp. fulgescens (Mitt.) H. Hofmann comb. nov., H. nevadense (Lesq.) Ren. & Card. subsp. nevadense, H. n. subsp. aeneum (Mitt.) H. Hofmann, H. nuttallii (Wils.) Jaeg., H. philippeanum (Spruce) Schimper, and H. sericeum (Hedw.) Schimper. Important gametophyte characters for the differentiation of taxa are provided by the alar cells, cells at the leaf insertion, margin denticulation, the costa (length and dentation on the back), length of epidermal cells in the branch cortex and, with some restrictions, the orientation of the branches (straight versus curved). Diagnostic characters of the sporophyte are the surface structure of the exostome, development of the endostome (length of segments, height of basal membrane, segment perforation, cilia present or lacking); of more limited value are the form of capsule and operculum, and the surface structure of the seta. The diagnostic characters and those which were formerly used to distinguish taxa are discussed in detail. A key is given for the identification of specimens without or with sporophytes. The genus has a Holarctic distribution and shows greatest diversity in Western North America (five species). Thirteen names are reduced to synonyms and 30 taxa are excluded from the genus.
20149598|Leptobarbula berica is reported for the first time from Belgium and The Netherlands, and for the second time from the Federal Republic of Germany.

20149166|Three species of bryophytes are reported as new to the Iceland flora: Peltolepis quadrata, found in Vesturbjrg, Vatnajkull 1968; Lophozia opacifolia, found in Goddalur, NW. Iceland 1969, and Thuidium recognitum, found in Goddalur, NW. Iceland 1969. -- Specimens in herb. ICEL.
20150042|Analysis of the data from the Swiss bryophyte mapping project revealed bias in frequency estimates. Data based on a systematic survey of Switzerland allow a reliable measurement of the relative frequency of common taxa. The degree of rarity of uncommon taxa, however, is difficult to assess with these data alone. Further information from non-systematic sampling and from the literature was used for the comparison of old and new frequency estimates. Different types of bias and their causes are discussed and illustrated by distribution maps of twelve taxa. Bias mostly originates in methodological problems, neglect, and uneven knowledge of the taxa and the study area. Elimination of such bias is essential in a species conservation context.
20149979|Annual populations of Anthoceros agrestis and Phaeoceros carolinianus were surveyed over seven years in 28 arable fields fields in north-western Switzerland. Gametophytic occurrences of the two hornwort taxa are compared to management type recorded at each census (three categories based on the crop type: cereal, maize/root-crops, other) and to temperature, relative humidity and precipitation data retrieved from recordings at nearby meteorological stations. Hornwort occurrences were found to be strongly associated with cropland farming practices but not with weather conditions. Anthoceros, and to a lesser extent Phaeoceros, were found regularly, and often abundantly, in untreated stubble-fields, but were more rare and poorly developed in stubble-fields with catchcrop, fields with maize, root-crops, and fodder-crops. Soil quality did not differ significantly between fields with and nearby fields without hornwort gametophytes. The soils investigated in selected fields are subneutral, rather permeable, contain moderate amounts of organic matter, and are classified as sandy loams. Since hornworts are largely confined to cultivated fields in Central Europe, management effectively influences the population dynamics at a regional scale, and may play an essential role for their local survival.
20149414| The seasonal variation of lipids in Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.) Klinggr. shoots collected in SW Finland was studied in several layers from the capitulum to a depth of 24 cm. The highest total lipid values as well as the highest fatty acid contents of the total lipids, triglycerides and steryl + wax esters, on a dry weight basis, were found in the photosynthetically active parts of the shoot. Particularly high values were found in the capitulum from material collected in early winter and early spring. The pronounced decreases in the contents of total lipids, total acyl lipids, triglycerides and steryl + wax esters, and particularly the drastic decreases in the contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids with increased depth of the sampling level were sene-scence-related occurrences in S. fuscum. Seasonal changes in the content of total lipids were observed also in senescent parts, but these were not related to the occurrence of acyl lipids, i.e. the usual membrane and storage lipids. The content of lipids, particularly of triglycerides in the capitulum, decreased with the start of growth of the shoot apex in spring and further decreased during shoot lengthening and senescence of the remains of the old overwintered capitulum. It is concluded that in S. fuscum the capitulum is the major site of lipid storage. Unlike subarctic Dicranum elongatum, senescent parts do not hold polyunsaturated fatty acids in storage. ///        Sphagnum fuscum (Schimp.)

20149528|Remains of gametophytes and associated spores of Meesia triquetra were observed in peat of middle and late Allerd age. From macrofossils co-occurring with M. triquetra the two levels at which this species is present are interpreted as transitional stages, the lower from a predominantly aquatic phase into a sedge fen and the upper from the sedge fen into a Sphagnum bog. In central and northern Europe M. triquetra occurs in mesotrophic fens. Fossil assemblages with this species are indicative of comparable local conditions. The final extinction of the species in a large part of western Europe took place over the last 150 years and is most likely to be attributed to man-made changes in its sites, e.g. drainage.
20149471| Lepicolea scolopendra var. magellanica Gola from southern Patagonia, which had not been studied since its original publication, is described as an independent species: L. magellanica (Gola) Solari stat. nov.

20150193|The taxonomic identity of the Japanese species Sphagnum subobesum (sect. Subsecunda) has been outlined, and morphologically compared with material of reported occurrences of the species in Pacific North America, and related species. It is concluded that the North American records are erroneous, based on collections of S. inexspectatum Flatb. and S. andrusii. The formal status of the latter taxon is raised to species level based on the basionym S. subsecundum var. andrusii Crum. Sphagnum andrusii is known from Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, and the Nahanni area, NWT, Canada. Sphagnum inexspectatum has a known distribution mainly confined to coastal areas of the North Pacific Arc. Current knowledge suggests that S. subobesum is endemic to Japan. Sphagnum subobesum is lectotypified.

The hepatic species considered were: Cololejeunea minutissima, Frullania tamarisci and Radula lindenbergiana, and the mosses: Antitrichia californica, A. curtipendula, Cryphaea heteromalla, Fabronia pusilla, Habrodon perpusillus, Sematophyllum substrumulosum, Zygodon rupestris and Z. viridissimus. The hepatics all show an Atlantic distribution, while in the mosses we can emphasise some different distribution patterns, particularly between the two Antitrichia species, C. heteromalla, H. perpusillus, S. substrumulosum and Z. viridissimus. On the other hand, species such as F. pusilla and Z. rupestris show a much more ample distribution now than in the past, as observed by recent field studies made by the authors. The herbarium and bibliographic references, before and after 1950, as well as confirmation of old records (before 1950) and comments for each species are presented. The present study represents an important background for future environmental assessment of the epiphytic bryoflora status, especially in changing areas of the country.
20150067|Relationships within the Plagiotheciaceae were studied using cladistic methods, based on morphological and anatomical characters. Two main analyses were performed, with 27 ingroup species, representing 14 genera, and seven different outgroup taxa supposedly closely to distantly related to the core Plagiotheciaceae taxa. A first analysis including all taxa, and with the resulting cladogram rooted with Lembophyllum divulsum (Hook. f. & Wils.) Lindb., suggests that neither Isopterygium nor Taxiphyllum belongs to the family. An analysis of the relationships within the family as it is suggested to be circumscribed in the first evaluation, and with the cladogram rooted by Calliergonella, suggests that also Acrocladium should possibly be excluded. A Plagiotheciaceae consisting of only Plagiothecium is not supported by our results, because most of the included species of this genus appeared in a basal grade within the family. The family is here suggested to include the genera Bardunovia, Catagonium, Herzogiella, Isopterygiopsis, Myurella, Orthothecium, Plagiothecium, Platydictya, Pseudotaxiphyllum, Rhizofabronia, and Struckia, whereas the taxonomic position of Acrocladium needs further evaluation. Characters of the sporophyte and perichaetia are relatively important for the internal structure of the cladogram in the more restricted analysis of the family. Whether this is due to convergent adaptations to certain habitats or not needs to be evaluated by means of other character sets. Members of the Plagiotheciaceae are found either in the northern or southern temperate zones, or at high altitudes in subtropical and tropical areas. Adaptations to calcareous or truly epiphytic habitats evolved mainly among more advanced members of the family.

20150115| Crossidium crassinerve from the Mojave Desert of Nevada (USA) was investigated to test the hypothesis that it exhibits an annual life history. Individual age was estimated to be from as short as three years to as long as 70 years, depending on which metric was employed to approximate age (length or biomass). Biomass extrapolations were found to be more conservative in longevity estimates. When placed in culture, buds and protonemata appeared from older portions of the cut profile of each population, indicating that plants are capable of regeneration from stem tissue and rhizoids that are several years old. The length and biomass of the most recent growth interval were very low, averaging 0.10 mm and 13 g, respectively. Over 90% of the annual biomass was composed of leaves. Ramet density of the populations was very high (4.0 ramets mm), while individuals averaged only 2.5 mm in length and 150 g in biomass. On average, individuals exhibited 1.4 branches/individual inclusive of the main axis. Crossidium crassinerve is concluded to be a perennial species.

20150206|The physiological activities of bryophytes span cellular, organismal and community levels of organization. In contrast, studies of function have generally been limited to excised shoots, to branch systems or to lower organizational levels and have not accounted for processes that occur over larger spatial extents. Furthermore, bryophyte physiological activity varies temporally as metabolism is governed by water status, temperature and other environmental factors. Most functional studies have been restricted to short-term measurements that may not provide representative views of long-term performance. Fortunately, some researchers have recognized these limitations and have begun to investigate bryophyte function at larger and more meaningful spatial scales, over longer time periods, and within more realistic ecological contexts. Using examples from the recent literature, this review illustrates 1) how size (e.g. spatial extent) influences short- and long-term carbon gain in bryophytes, 2) that micro-scale (i.e. 0.25-1 m) investigations are essential for understanding physiological processes that operate at that scale and are also important for linking shoot-level measurements with whole ecosystem fluxes, and 3) how carbon stable isotope abundance (

20149151|Revision of the Dutch species of the Bryum erythrocarpum complex. A revision is given of the collections of the "Brya erythrocarpa" from Holland. Delimitating the species of this group the authors have followed the monograph of the European "Brya erythrocarpa" by Crundwell & Nyholm (1964). 5 species have been found in Holland up till now: Bryum micro-erythrocarpum C. Mll. & Kindb., B. radiculosum Brid., B. klinggraeffii Schimp., B. violaceum Crundw. & Nyholm and B. ruderale Crundw. & Nyholm. The latter three have not been collected until 1968, B. violaceum and B. ruderale being recorded here for the first time from our country. These two species were discovered in the Southern part of the province of Limburg, a hilly area with rich, calcareous soils, the western extension of the mountainous region of Central Europe in our country. Most of the recent gatherings of Dutch specimens of the "Brya erythrocarpa" have been from this area. Bryum micro-erythrocarpum appears to be relatively common and widespread in Holland. It mainly grows on calcareous or non-calcareous, sandy or peaty, sometimes clayish soils. It is a fairly variable species, and intermediate forms have been found between Bryum micro-erythrocarpum and Bryum rubens, an allied species which is not yet known from Holland. Bryum radiculosum has been gathered in Holland almost exclusively in the 19th century. It occurs mainly on old brick walls.
20149538| The name Hypnobartlettia fontana Ochyra is proposed for a large, coarse, aquatic moss which was collected by John K. Bartlett at Waikaropupu Limestone Springs Reserve, N. W. Nelson District, South Island, New Zealand. The plants show a superficial resemblance to the aquatic expressions of some amblystegiaceous mosses which are generally characterized by a single, very stout and excurrent costa. H. fontana is readily known by its aquatic habitat, lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate leaves with a very stout, single and long-excurrent costa, linear-flexouse leaf cells, minutely papillose because of projecting, thickened upper ends, entirely bistratose lamina with only occasional unistratose streaks in the lowest portion, and the presence of scattered, filamentous paraphyllia and foliose, broad, suborbicular pseudoparaphyllia. As the combination of the bistratose lamina and the occurrence of paraphyllia exhibited by this moss does not occur in any existing family of pleurocarpous mosses, it is deemed necessary to create the new family Hypnobartlettiaceae for the new genus and species described herein. The phylogenetic affinity of this family is obscure and will remain uncertain until sporophytes are found. The taxomomic position of Donrichardsia macroneuron (Grout) Crum & Anderson is discussed and the new family Donrichardsiaceae created to accomodate this endemic species and genus from Texas. ///  Hypnobartlettia fontana Ochyra   , ,  ,   .      ,  . . ,  ,  .          ,    ,      .

Rhizoids of both Fontinalis squamosa and F. antipyretica are negatively phototropic; those of F. squamosa respond to contact by growing a cluster of dense rhizoid branches that no longer respond to light. Contact response by rhizoids of F. antipyretica could not be evaluated due to their infrequent occurrence and small size.

20149792| Moisture-dependent CO exchange and its recovery after drying was studied in certain forest and peat mosses under laboratory conditions. The decrease in net photosynthesis caused by drying begins at a water content of 170-500% of dry weight in forest mosses and 600-1200% in peat mosses. In all moss species except Polytrichum commune photosynthesis decreased when the water content rose beyond a certain species-specific optimal level. The recovery of net photosynthesis after a short period of desiccation was 65-99% in the forest mosses, but immediate recovery was poor in the peat mosses. Once CO exchange ceased because of dehydration, net photosynthesis achieved at most small positive values after rewetting for three days. The low level of net CO exchange after rewetting is caused by low photosynthesis and an increase in respiration. ///  CO,   ,                .    ,       170-500%       600-1200   .    ,  Polytrichum commune  ,           .         65-99%   ,        .

20150016|The relationships between 80 species representing the Sematophyllaceae and possibly related taxa are evaluated based on morphological and anatomical characters, and using cladistic methods. Four different outgroups, Hypnum cupressiforme, Isopterygium tenerum, Trachythecium verrucosum, and Vesicularia dubyana were used. The last three belong to tropical Hypnaceae, where the closest relatives of the Sematophyllaceae are likely to be found, whereas H. cupressiforme was used to assess the position of a number of ingroup species resembling temperate members of the Hypnaceae in some gametophytic characters. The results of the present study suggest that the Sematophyllaceae are likely to be monophyletic, and that the family can be subdivided into two subfamilies, the Sematophylloideae and the Wijkioideae Hedens & Buck (subfam. nov.; Type: Wijkia H. A. Crum; including also Acanthorrhynchium and Trismegistia), whereas the taxonomic position of a number of probable members of the Hypnaceae is not clearly resolved in the present study. The Sematophylloideae are circumscribed by four character states related to the vegetative gametophyte and by four of the sexual branches and sporophyte. The Wijkioideae, which are likely to be the more ancestral subfamily of the Sematophyllaceae, are differentiated from the Hypnaceae and Sematophylloideae by three character states related to the vegetative gametophyte and by eight of the sexual branches and sporophyte. No further subdivision of the Sematophyllaceae was evident from the results, and clades corresponding with the earlier recognized Heterophyllioideae, Clastobryoideae, or Macrohymenioideae were not found. On the other hand, several genera, such as Sematophyllum and Taxithelium, appear to be polyphyletic and their circumscriptions are in need of revision. Characters of the sexual branches and the sporophyte were generally more important than the gametophytic characters for the appearance of the cladograms in the present investigation. The results underline the importance of understanding whether specialized character states in sporophytes are homologous or analogous in order to reach a better understanding regarding relationships within the Sematophylloideae.
20150109|A presentation of various species and population concepts employed in bryophyte systematics and population genetics is given, with special emphasis on how molecular markers have influenced these concepts. The various concepts often reflect the evolutionary processes that are considered important as cohesive forces maintaining species and populations as distinct groups. Traditionally, emphasis has been placed on natural selection and the lack of gene flow as major cohesive forces in bryophytes. More recently, reproductive barriers have been regarded as important elements in species and population definitions, despite the assumed widespread clonality in bryophytes. Aspects of various bryophyte species and population concepts are discussed, and guidelines for population delimitation suitable in molecular studies are suggested.

27809540|Protonemata of Polytrichum commune (Polytrichaceae) were grown in vitro from sterilized spores on MurashigeSkoog (MS) medium. Well-developed protonemata were used to test the influences of varying sucrose and ammonium nitrate concentrations on protonemal morphology and development of P. commune. The experiments were conducted on modified Beneke medium under three levels of sucrose (0 g l1, 10 g l1, 40 g l1) and three levels of ammonium nitrate (0 g l1, 0.2 g l1, 0.4 g l1). The results show that protonemal morphology and growth of P. commune were significantly influenced by sucrose, ammonium nitrate and their combination. The protonemata grew better on media with sucrose: ammonium nitrate ratios of 10:0.2, 40:0.2 and 40:0.4 compared to other media. Protonemal growth was inhibited on media with a ratio of sucrose: ammonium nitrate below 10:0.2 and on media without added nitrogen. Reduced or abnormal growth of protonemata was induced on ammonium nitrate deficient media. The understanding of effects of carbon and nitrogen concentration on protonemal growth of P. commune can provide a basis for its use in monitoring studies.

20149784| The bryophyte flora of the Dutch chalk grasslands has been strongly impoverished in the recent past. The bryophyte layer of plots of several management experiments was investigated 1) to indicate an appropriate management regime to regenerate a species-rich bryophyte layer and 2) to estimate the relative importance of several sources of diaspores in the establishment of bryophyte species (i.e., spreading of local populations, the local diaspore bank in the soil, and transport by air). In abandoned chalk grasslands dominated by the grass Brachypodium pinnatum, species richness increased strongly within three years after introduction of mowing. In yearly-mown chalk grasslands an increase of the number of species was observed in plots that were clipped twice or even four times a year. In all experiments the creation of a lower, more open phanerogam canopy seemed to explain the increase of bryophyte species. The invading species were mainly colonists and annual shuttle species. Their diaspores presumably originated from the local diaspore bank or from populations in the same chalk grassland or its direct neighbourhood. Invasion of species that were not known from the direct surroundings of the chalk grasslands was not observed. Invasion by perennial bryophytes was also nearly absent. It is concluded that, in many chalk grasslands, species richness of the bryophyte layer can be increased, although the original species richness will not be attained again. ///          .         1)              2)            (..   ,       ,   ).    ,    Brachypodium pinnatum,          .   ,    ,       ,         .      ,     , ,    .   ,  ,     .  , -,                 .     ,      .        .    ,           ,      .

20150094|In two experimental nature gardens a strong increase of Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (Hedw.) Warnst. was observed over the period 1980-2000. The species expanded on several soil types and in various grassland communities. Data on R. squarrosus from other parts of the Netherlands suggest that this is not only a local phenomenon. At various places a clear increase of the species was observed. The formation of a thick layer by the species seems to be a new phenomenon. Atmospheric deposition of nutrients may be an important factor in the increase of R. squarrosus.

20149179| (1). Discussion of the difficult delimitation of Bazzania tricrenata s. str. against similar species in Europe and North America. As was pointed out by Evans (1923) and supported by Schuster (1969), the true B. tricrenata s. str. never has caducous leaves, what was confirmed from the study of extensive European material. (2). The true B. tricrenata s. str. is circumboreal in distribution. The single record from the Acores (Jovet-Ast 1948) belongs to B. azorica Buch et H. Perss. (3). B. tricrenata (Wahlenb.) Lindb. in Brotherus (1872) has to replace B. tricrenata (Wahlenb.) Trevisan (1877). (4). Inspite of the statements in literature the true B. denudata originally described from North America is lacking in Europe. (5). The records of B. denudata from central Europe mainly belong to B. flaccida (Dum.) Grolle c. n., which differs from B. denudata among others by a much lower number of oil bodies in leaf cells. B. flaccida is an endemic species of temparate subcontinental Europe, but is lacking in Scandinavia and on the British Isles.

The genus Scorpidium sensu Hedens is interpreted as consisting of S. scorpioides (Hedw.) Limpr., S. cossoni (Schimp.) Hedens comb. nov. (syn. Drepanocladus intermedius) and S. revolvens (Sw. ex Anonymo) Hedens comb. nov. (syn. Drepanocladus revolvens). The two species Drepanocladus vernicosus and D. lapponicus (Norrl.) Z. Smirn. are referred to Hamatocaulis Hedens gen. nov., a genus closely related to Scorpidium, but differing in, i.a., the stem anatomy, the pattern of colouration, the structure of the alar cells, the proximal branch leaves and the habitat. Drepanocladus lycopodioides (Brid.) Warnst., D. latifolius (Lindb. & H. Arn.) Warnst., D. brevifolius (Lindb.) Warnst., Pseudocalliergon turgescens (T. Jens.) Loeske (Scorpidium turgescens (T. Jens.) Loeske) and Calliergon trifarium (Web. & Mohr) Kindb. are excluded from Scorpidium in the sense of this paper due to, i.a., their total lack of red colours, their different alar cells, their different axillary hairs and their different pattern of the lower outer peristomial layer of the exostome. These five (species are probably closely related to each other and should probably be placed in one genus. The species Campylium longicuspis (Lindb. & H. Arn.)

20150216|The Reindeer Preserve and an eastern neighbouring area near the Anderson River are home to 54 species of hepatics, among which are several species that are rare in Canada, including Anastrophyllum sphenoloboides, Lophochaete fryei, Nardia japonica and Lophozia perssonii. Arnellia fennica and Tritomaria scitula are reported found with perianths. Mesoptychia sahlbergii also occurred with perianths, a rare feature that was previously known in North America only from the Alaska-Yukon region. Based on the amplified distribution of many taxa of Arctic leafy hepatics, their distribution has been interpreted as "a result of possibly surviving the Pleistocene in ice-free areas north of the main centres of glaciation". Although the rather flat Mackenzie River delta and the neighbouring area along the Anderson River do not appear to house obvious refugia, in contrast to higher mountains (possible nunataks) or high headlands, three such pointed survivors were found in the investigated area. These were Lophozia polaris, Anastrophyllum sphenoloboides and Cryptocolea imbricata. Some species, known from the ice-free refugia believed to have been located in the Alaska-Yukon region, today also occur to a very limited extent eastward into the Canadian Arctic. Among these species are Mesoptychia sahlbergii and Lophochaete fryei. Pellia alpicola (R. M. Schust.) Damsh. stat. nov. has been proposed at a specific level as a consequence of its new occurrences.

20149811| Details of reproductive biology, taken in a wide sense, have been published at different times and for different reasons, often as a by-product of investigations with other aims. The objects of this paper are to collect facts from different sources, to combine them with the recent advances in knowledge of reproductive biology and to reveal gaps still awaiting exploration. The debate concerning the ability of Sphagnum spores to germinate and of the resulting protonemata to grow in natural habitats is reviewed. Most facts imply that early negative results were caused by artificial experimental conditions. The roles of different modes of vegetative reproduction are discussed. Different factors which may influence fertility are also outlined. Production of spore capsules is shown to be in average more common in monoicous species than in dioicous species. This could be explained if monoicous species possess the ability to self-fertilize. It is also suggested that a correlation between breeding system and habitat may exist. It is pointed out that future investigations are needed to (1) study evolutionary processes like hybridization, allopolyploidization, and genetic differentiation in populations; (2) understand the life strategies of different taxa. ///   ,    ,         ,      ,   .                    ,    ,     .       ,          .     ,         .      .    ,     . ,               .       -        .  , , ,       . ,       1)   ,   , ,     ; 2)     .

20150069|Thirty-four bryophyte species with atlantic, atlantic mediterranean or mediterranean distributions in Europe have extended their ranges into Central Europe during the past two decades. These range extensions of several hundred kilometres to the east or north-east are correlated with an increase in the mean temperatures of the winter months of December, January and February and a shift of the 3.5C isotherm some 400 km to the east. Over the past two centuries seven of these species had occurred sporadically in Central Europe. The former occurrences of Lepidozia cupressina, Cryphaea heteromalla, Lejeunea lamacerina, Tortula pagorum and Bryum torquescens, Frullania microphylla and Plagiochila punctata are correlated with positive temperature anomalies in the past. Bryophytes react rapidly to climatic fluctuations because they are easily dispersed by spores and have short life cycles.

Schistidium liliputanum is reported as new to North America where it is widespread in the eastern part of the continent.
20150241|The bryophyte flora on the Campus area of the University of Bremen was studied at various habitats. The habitats could be classified into two main types, soft substrates such as grasslands and hard substrates like walls and stones. Based on indicator values, both types showed different environmental conditions and related species compositions. Hard substrates were characterised by higher temperature and pH as well as lower water content. The positive relationship between bryophyte richness and number of habitats reflects the important effect of landscape heterogeneity on species richness. Bryophyte diversity measured as Shannon index was related to environmental factors, and was in general highest at intermediate levels of light availability and in the case of soft-substrate also at intermediate levels of water content. Therefore, this study is in line with patterns that highest species diversity will be found at intermediate levels of environmental gradients.

20150203|Relationships between reproduction and rarity in British bryophytes, and other aspects of reproductive ecology, are considered in relation to theories concerning the importance of meiosis in the evolution of living organisms. This discussion raises three key questions, and recent studies relating to one of these questions are reviewed. The results provide powerful, although largely circumstantial evidence that moss spores are vitally important in establishing new populations, with asexual reproduction often playing a major role in colony expansion and maintenance.
20149596| Fissidens crassipes Wils. ex B.S.G. var. philibertii Besch. is recorded for the first time from Egypt. The total number of mosses known from the country now is 130 taxa. Only 20 of these bear sporophytes. Members of the order Pottiales form over 40% of the flora. The most favoured habitat for mosses in the country, is on and between red-bricks of walls just above water surface especially in shaded ares. ///     Fissidens crassipes Wils. ex B.S.G. . philibertii Besch.   ,     ,  130 .  20    .

20149918|The relationships between 65 species of the "Hookeriales", the Sematophyllaceae, the Hypopterygiaceae, the Ptychomniaceae and the Garovaglioideae, as well as a few other species are evaluated using cladistic methods. These taxa have been suggested to be related to each other in an earlier overview study of the group "pleurocarpous mosses", or in other earlier published studies. The results of the present and the earlier studies indicate that the taxonomic position of the Hypopterygiaceae may either be within or close to the "Hookeriales" or among the "Isobryales". The Ptychomniaceae is either among the most basal diplolepidous pleurocarpous mosses or in a basal position among the "Hookeriales" or the Sematophyllaceae. The Garovaglioideae are most probably forming a basal clade among the other taxa treated here, possibly together with the Ptychomniaceae. In the present analyses, the "Hookeriales" species usually appear in one or (in two out of seven analyses) a few clades (at the same grade), often including the Hypopterygiaceae. Within the "Hookeriales" clade, two less inclusive clades could usually be recognised, one appearing in all analyses and corresponding with a large part of the Callicostaceae. Other relationships within the "Hookeriales" clade do not clearly agree with earlier suggested classifications. The Sematophyllaceae form a single clade in some analyses, but the patterns among the species of this family were less consistent than in the "Hookeriales" clade. The patterns found within the Sematophyllaceae in the present study do neither support nor completely reject earlier suggested classifications within the family. Crosbya straminea and Daltonia splachnoides were placed in the Sematophyllaceae in the present analyses. However, many character states in these species are similar to those in some species of the "Hookeriales" clade, and their taxonomic position must be further evaluated. Problems related to the taxa having similarly specialised sporophytes are discussed, and these problems are approached (though not completely solved) by (1) downweighting the obviously very similar specialisations in many species (the gametophytes clearly indicate separate relationships in many taxa with similar peristome specialisations), by (2) coding the perichaetial and sporophytic character states as unknown for species with strongly specialised sporophytes, or (3) by performing analyses both without, and with only characters of the perichaetium and sporophyte included.
20149303| During the winter of 1978 some analyses were made of mossocieties on a stubble-field near Eindhoven (Netherlands). Two types were found, corresponding to the Pottietum truncatulae (Gams 27) Waldh. 44 and the Riccia glauca-Anthoceros union Koppe 55. 
20149307|The distributio area of Platygyrium repens in Norway coincides with that of the thermophilious element of the vascular flora. Thi indicates that its distribution is mainly determined by the summer temperature. In NOrway it is nearly an obligate epiphyte, growing on a variety of deciduous trees. It is never recorded from conifers.
20150039|How we select species for conservation is based on the rationale for saving them from man-induced extinction. Motives related to aesthetic properties, ethical values, basic research needs, economical values, rarity and threat, and ecological values all provide arbitrary or insufficient criteria for selecting which species to preserve when resources for this are limited. Phylogenetic methods provide the means for closing taxa to represent the maximum genetic variation in a monophyletic group, when a specified amount of resources is available. Since the genetic diversity is reflected in all we know about taxa, we are likely to catch the variability in different traits in the most cost-efficient way with this technique. Regardless of the criteria used for selecting species for preservation, a world-wide or at least continental approach is necessary. Accordingly, the importance of national populations must be evaluated in terms of the global distribution of the respective taxon in order to choose appropriate areas for action plans. Even if actual conservation measures are usually implemented at the national level, selection based on small geographical areas will in general lead to suboptimal uses of the available resources. Individual countries have a high responsibility for taxa that are identified as phylogenetically representative and are rare or threatened on a global scale, irrespective of their frequency within the national boudaries. Adequate information on the biology of selected species needs to be acquired to determine their status, ecological requirements, and potential threats. Demographic analyses identify the sensitivity and relative importance for the population growth of different life cycle stages, and are an effective tool for assessing the response of populations to changing conditions. Since present levels of funding preclude extensive biological research, we may have to focus efforts on relatively few species representing different aspects of the total set in need of conservation, to assemble indirect evidence from other studies, to make use of and adjust existing programs, or to protect sites with a species-rich bryophyte flora ("hot spots"). Increased co-operation between scientists, conservation agencies and governmental authorities will further promote the success of our investments. Finally, social and economic behaviour causing the degradation of biological diversity must be addressed, which requires a fundamental change in human attitudes.

20149339|In the Noordoostpolder, one of the large land reclamations in the former Zuiderzee (embanked in 1941) several interesting species were found, among which Loeskeobryum brevirostre, Hookeria lucens, and Plagiochila asplenioides, which are rare in the Netherlands. They all grew on ditch sides in a forest on pleistocene boulder clay. Phytogeographically the occurrence of these species links the boulder clay patches in this recently exposed area to the more hilly and much older districts in the eastern and southernmost part of the country.
20149210|This article gives an account of the bryophytes collected in a claypit east of the river Maas near Venlo in the north of the province of Limburg. An interesting find was Leiocolea badensis growing in dense mats on rather humid clayish, non-calcareous soil in a cover of bryophytes consisting of a.o. Anisothecium varium, Barbula fallax, Didymodon tophaceus, Mniobryum delicatulum, Blasia pusilla, Pellia endiviaefolia, Riccardia pinguis, and R. sinuata. Leiocolea badensis has been collected in Holland twice before, both times growing on calcareous soil. This claypit also forms a new locality of the coastal species Fossombronia incurva and seems to be the southernmost one known of that species on the continent. It grows together with Riccardia incurvata in a moss vegetation belonging to the Haplomitrium-Fossombronia incurva community Koppe. In the same locality the rare Lophozia capitata was collected on sandy gravel in a Betula verrucosa-Alnus incana plantation. The bryofloristical and ecological importance of this claypit is emphasized.

20149579| A piece of thallus of either Conocephalum conicum, Marchantia polymorpha, or Parmelia tinctorum and filter paper strips soaked with biphthalate buffer containing NaHSO were placed separately in a 20 ml screw-cap vial. The gaseous concentration of SO in the vial was dependent on the pH of the solution and remained constant during the fumigation period. The injurious effect of SO was examined by measuring the photosynthetic and respiratory rates of the thalli before and after the fumigation. Illumination during fumigation accelerated the SO inhibition of photosynthesis in both M. polymorpha and P. tinctorum. Transfer of the thalli to SO-free air after 18 h fumigation induced some recovery of photosynthesis during 24 h with M. polymorpha, but not with P. tinctorum, where additional visible injury was seen even in SO-free air during 24 h. It is clear that physiological injury by SO occurs in advance of the visible injury. ///     Conocephalum conicum, Marchantia polymorpha,  Parmelia tinctorum    ,   ,  NaHSO,         .

The variability of this species in the Netherlands is briefly discussed. T. flavovirens var. glareicola is recognized for the first time and proved to be much more common than var. flavovirens. T. tortuosa was found growing on a concrete bridge. Previously it was only reported from sites where it might have been introduced.
20149944| Demographic information on the perennial clonal moss Hylocomium splendens was obtained by annual census of growing points and mature segments (with dry weight estimated from measurements in situ) in two SE Norwegian boreal spruce forest areas for 6 yr. Mean Hylocomium segment size differed consistently between areas and between years. Between-year variation in mean segment size was strongly correlated with an index integrating climatic effects on moss growth. Accumulated time in hydrated state is considered the major climatic determinant of size in this ectohydric plant, and the risk of termination was high in dry summers. Ramification and regeneration from buds after one yr delay of development varied little while regeneration from tissue older than two yr varied strongly between years. Rates of none of these branching types was explained by macroclimatic data. Loss rates were related to rodent population densities in one of the areas. Demographic data for mature segments were analysed separately for each area and each one-yr period by stage-structured transition matrix models. The variation in population growth rates ( = 0.87-1.22) was larger than in most forest vascular plants. Adverse climatic conditions seem to affect more strongly the fate of large than of small segments. Populations increase in years with a wetter (more oceanic) climate, mainly because dry weight increase leads to elevated ramification rates and hence higher contribution of transitions from large segments to . Use of ectohydric bryophytes as biomonitors of climatic change is discussed.

20149872| Archaeobotanical study of samples from the terp (dwelling mound) of Heveskesklooster (province of Groningen, the Netherlands) yielded, besides many remains of vascular plants, 43 different taxa of mosses. The samples from which they originate are dated to the Roman Period, Middle Ages and Modern Times. The moss record from Heveskesklooster is compared with: (1) records of subfossil mosses from other terps of the Netherlands and Germany, (2) the recent moss flora from Heveskesklooster and (3) the subfossil vascular plant record from the terp. It is shown that the more common species are still present in the area, while those that were less frequently encountered are nowadays rare or lacking in the northeastern part of the Netherlands. In contrast, the recent moss flora comprises 40 species that are absent in the subfossil record. Ecological characterization of the environment on the basis of the subfossil mosses differs to some extent from both the present vegetation and the subfossil record of vascular plants. This can partly be explained by differences in the ecological spectra of mosses and vascular plants. ///     "" ( )    ( , ) ,     , 43   . ,   ,   ,     .     : (1)       ""    , (2)        (3)       "". ,         ,      ,   ,      -  .  ,     40 ,    .                     .       -     .

20149276|The new checklist of Dutch liverworts comprises 126 species, 1 subspecies and 5 varieties.

20150105|Correlations between character states in pleurocarpous mosses are evaluated in order to find those states that are most strongly positively related to each other and which form complexes of three or more characters. The most important such complexes of statistically significantly correlated states, some of which include more than 20 states, are related to the spore capsule and peristome, and to the calyptra. These structures are all important in relation to spore dispersal, which evidently depends on a considerably more intricate set of many co-evolving morphological structures than is the case with any found gametophyte function. The numerous correlations between character states of the spore capsule and peristome underline the importance of considering entire complexes of states when studying spore dispersal and the factors that may be important for the evolution of various capsule and peristome traits. Some of these complexes of states can be explained by the phylogenetic history of the taxa having them. However, both such complexes and those that evolved numerous times and in several groups, as a more direct response to specific habitat factors, are likely to be functional under extant environmental conditions because they are distributed in a non-random way among habitats. Parameters such as wind speed, air humidity, and moisture of substrates for spore germination are likely to be important factors for explaining the function of capsule plus peristome state complexes and calyptra structures. More data on microhabitat parameters, as well as theoretical calculations regarding optimal structures for spore release under various conditions are necessary before we can hope to understand sporophyte function in various environments in more detail. The term 'erect capsule' is suggested to be restricted to cases where the capsules are truly erect, that is, directed upwards, whereas straight or almost straight capsules that are oriented along the same axis as the straight seta should be called 'seta-oriented capsules'. The latter term makes more sense biologically, since most pleurocarps with such capsules have horizontally oriented capsules because they grow on more or less vertical surfaces.

20149587| Using starch gel electrophoresis, peroxidase and esterase phenotypes of Pellia endiviifolia were analysed. Peroxidase phenotypes in thalli in culture show disappearance of the fast zone A, while it remains present in other Pellia taxa. Thalli growing in the field, (including thalli growing within a single colony and presumably constituting a single clone) exhibited variable staining intensity of this zone down to a total absence of activity (null allele imitation). Even though culture provides a homogeneous material by eliminating the unstable zone A (between 2nd and 6th month of culture), it may suggest an artificial pattern of similarities and differences in the isoenzyme spectrum between individual Pellia taxa unless phenotypes of the field material are compared in parallel. Analysis of zone B esterases with either band B5 or B6, which usually exclude each other, proved to be difficult to interpret even after an appropriate genetic analysis was performed. Isozyme expression even involves lack of enzymatic activity in individual bands, both in material from culture and material collected in the field and in thallus, sporophyte stalks and sporangia; thus, for some inter-phenotype differences described recently, a similar interpretation might have to replace an interpretation in terms of differences between null and active alleles. ///     Pellia endiviifolia       .           ,          Pellia. ,   , ( ,    , , ,   ),            (  ).

20149250| The author carried out a bryosociological research on Cistus and heath formations, in wet situations, in the crystalline districts of Provence and eastern Corsica. Heliophilous mosses and liverworts were noticed, particularly Fossombronia caespitiformis De Not. and Pleuridium subulatum (Huds.) Rabenh., which are common to all acidophilous Cistus populations and grow together with hygrophilous taxa like Archidium alternifolium (Dicks.) Schimp., Anthoceros laevis (L.) Prosk. and Entosthodon fascicularis (Hedw.) C. Mll. A part of them, such as Campylopus introflexus (Hedw.) Mitt., Bryum alpinum Huds. and Cheilothela chloropus (Brid.) Lindb. are typical of Isoetes lawns on the continent, and are replaced in Corsica by Anthoceros dichotomus Raddi, Riccia gougetiana Mont, and Entosthodon obtusus (Hedw.) Lindb. Pleurochaete squarrosa (Hedw.) Lindb. and Trichostomum mutabile Bruch are not exclusive to Cistus and heath formations, although playing an important rle in their bryophytic cover, which reaches values superior to 50%. ///                  .     ,  Fossombronia caespitiformis De Not.

20149172| The essential features of single- and double-peristomate capsules are reviewed and presented diagrammatically. The homology of the inner peristomial layer (IPL) and the outer spore sac is stressed and confirmed by indicating a tissue homologous to the primary peristomial layer (PPL) at spore sac level. The name "outer spore sac" should be applied solely to the tissue between archesporium and air space as a whole. In mature capsules the outer spore sac is decayed and stands out as a thin membrane. The granular coating on the inner side originates from the matrix in which the spore tetrads were embedded. ///       .      (IPL)      ,     (PPL)  .   ''    ,        .       ,      .      ,     . 
20150137| Population development and structure of the regionally annual hornworts Anthoceros agrestis and Phaeoceros carolinianus were studied in cultivated fields in the lowland of NW Switzerland. Ontogenetic stages of gametophytes and sporophytes were repeatedly surveyed at short time intervals in plots excluded from routine management during one growing season, and recruitment of A. agrestis was recorded in the subsequent season. A. agrestis was more abundant than P. carolinianus at the site scale, and its population development appeared to be more dynamic. The results suggest that in A. agrestis, gametophyte mortality is density-dependent in the early phase of its population development, and a minimum size for sexual reproduction occurs. Gametophyte recruitment probability from spores for A. agrestis was estimated at 4.810. Mean gametophyte growth rate was 0.1 mm/d for both species. P. carolinianus gametophytes lived longer and grew larger than those of A. agrestis. Gametangial initiation, fertilisation, sporophyte development, and spore maturation occurred within a few weeks after germination in both taxa. Spore maturation peaked in August but sporophytes developed during the entire growing season in many plants. 
20149874| The establishment of the three dominant species (Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum scoparium and Hylocomium splendens) in artificial gaps opened in the bryophyte layer of a Pinus sylvestris forest has been studied after experimental planting. Microsite conditions were not limiting for the establishment phase, because all three species established after planting, but their pattern of colonization was not identical. Pleurozium schreberi did not show a diaspore limitation. Neighbour populations seem to provide an efficient input of diaspores in the sites studied. Dicranum scoparium establishment was not affected by the proximity of neighbours, but planting significantly increased colonization. In the study sites, differences in the recruitment of this species seems to be mainly caused by the diaspore bank in the soil. The establishment of H. splendens was strongly limited by the absence of neighbours in the plots studied: planting increased its success. As in P. schreberi, no differences among sites were observed in H. splendens. Overall, diaspore input shows a wide variation among species and microsites, which strongly determines the success of establishment in forest floor gaps. ///     (Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum scoparium  Hylocomium splendens)  ,     Pinus sylvestris-     .       ,        ,       .

20149559|The Japanese garden in the estate of Clingendael (Wassenaar, The Netherlands) in the course of time has developed into a moss garden. The bryophyte flora consists now of 57 species, among which the locally rare Odontoschisma denudatum and Plagiochila asplenioides. Several species are restricted to paths and some probably have recently been introduced by visitors of by the application of new gravel. The distribution of some species in the garden has been mapped; the pattern of the five Polytrichum species occurring here is probably mainly related to differences in soil moisture regime.
20149541| Immature sporophytes of Dicranella staphylina Whitehouse were collected in the G.-D. of Luxembourg. The capsules are erect and symmetrical, which affirms the close relationship with D. rufescens.

20149185|All samples of the genus Microlepidozia from The Netherlands, present in the main Dutch institutional herbaria and some private collections have been re-examined. Several ones identified as M. setacea turned out to belong to M. sylvatica, a species which had been recorded only once before from The Netherlands. Distribution maps are given for both species. Apart from the differences in the female bracts the two species can usually be distinguished as follows: M. setacea: cuticula of all leaf cells moderately to strongly verrucose, only rarely weakly verrucose; amphigastria of the stems symmetrical, those of the branches symmetrical or more or less asymmetrical, mucilage cells absent or sparse; on wet, peaty soil or among Sphagnum, more rarely on sandy soil. M. sylvatica: cuticula in basal leaf cells smooth or weakly verrucose, in apical leaf cells weakly to moderately verrucose, sometimes rather strongly so; amphigastria of the stems moderately to strongly asymmetrical, those of the branches always strongly asymmetrical, mucilage cells frequent; on sandy soil in woods or heath, more rarely on peaty soil, rarely among Sphagnum.
20149795| Phascum leptophyllum C. Mll. from South Africa, Pottia denticulata Dix. & P. Vard. from India and P. splachnobryoides C. Mll. from China were found to be identical with Tortula rhizophylla (Sak.) Iwats. & K. Saito. Phascum leptophyllum is the earliest validly published name at the moment.

20149898| Brachythecium campestre (C. Mll.) B., S. & G. is known by its more or less plicate, ovate or rather broadly ovate to ovate-triangular stem leaves that are distinctly narrowed at their insertion and which are upwards gradually or suddenly narrowed to a long acumen. Its median lamina cells are relatively short (43-118 m long), its alar cells are rectangular to quadrate or transversely rectangular, and form an ovate or broadly ovate group that extends up along the basal leaf margin. The branch leaves have strongly denticulate margins, their nerve often ends in a strong, sharp abaxial spine, and is often rough in its upper back from distally prorate cells. The species is autoicous, and has a seta that is lowly or occasionally more strongly mamillose, in its upper 1/2-2/3 or sometimes throughout. The species' leaf areolation, and especially its alar groups, suggest that it is most closely related to the species around B. albicans (Hedw.) B., S. & G. and B. salebrosum (Web. & Mohr) B., S. & G. In northern Europe, B. campestre is known from the southern parts of Sweden, Norway and Finland, where it grows in more or less calcareous habitats, in grasslands, open forests and in more or less strongly disturbed man-made habitats. Brachythecium ryanii Kaur. is a later name of B. campestre. 
20149386|Schistidium pulvinatum (Hoffm. ex Hedw.) Brid. differs from S. apocarpum [(L.) ex Hedw.] Bruch & Schimp. in Bruch et al. in the absence of a peristome, the form and structure of the urn, operculum and columella, and the colour of the capsule. Schistidium pulvinatum is reported from two stations in Central Norway; these may be the only localities known in Fennoscandia.
20149562|Since the first record in 1976 Octodiceras fontanum has been found in more than 80 locations in the middle and southern part of the Netherlands. In the channels as well as in the River Rhine and Meuse the species is very common now, sometimes well-developed and abundant. The cause of this rapid spread is not clear. Sporulating plants were found twice. As the capsules are inconspicuous and fall off just before maturity, possibly the sporophytes have been overlooked in the past and might be more common than previously supposed.
20150186|Sphagnum inexspectatum (sect. Subsecunda) has been described as a new species, with combined morphological characteristics of S. orientale Savicz and S. subsecundum Nees. It has been proposed that the species originated through hybridization and "recombinant speciation" as a homoploidal daughter species of these species. The new species has a known distribution mainly confined to lowland, coastal areas of the North Pacific Arc in British Columbia, Alaska and Russia, with outlying localities in mountainous central Honshu, Japan, and the Philip Smith Mountains of continental Alaska. It is sympatric with S. subsecundum in most of its distribution, and with S. orientale in subarctic southwest Alaska. A morphological comparison has been made between the new species and S. orientale and S. subsecundum, with notes on the taxonomic relations to S. inundatum Russ. and S. lescurii Sull. S. inexspectatum has mainly been characterized by the combination of varyingly one- and bistratose stem cortices, short and pauci-fibrillose stem leaves with many circular hyalocyst pores on their distal part concave surface, and large pores in continuous commissural rows on the convex surface of the branch leaves. S. inexspectatum may have survived the Late Wisconsin glaciation in ice-free refugia in southern Beringia and adjacent, more southerly situated land areas in the North Pacific.
20149968|About 15% of bryophytes are threatened in Finland; 20 species have disappeared, 18 are endangered, 35 vulnerable, and 109 in need of monitoring. Especially threatened are liverworts growing on rotten logs.

20149542| Three alternative hypotheses are considered for Scouleria's relationship within the Haplolepideae: 1) Scouleria is the sister group to Seligeria, 2) Scouleria is the sister group to Schistidium, and 3) Scouleria is related to a higher taxic level, i.e. family, within the Haplolepideae excluding the Dicranales and Fissidentales; the last is tentatively accepted. Three species of Scouleria may be recognized: S. aquatica Hook. is of earliest derivation within the genus, and both S. marginata Britt. and S. patagonica (Mitt.) Jaeg. are derived based on the synapomorphy of a pseudocosta. Two previously recognized taxa, S. rschewinii Lindb. et Arn. and S. pulcherrima Broth., are considered synonyms of the polymorphic S. aquatica.

20149669| Three species of deep-water moss were studied from two clear ponds on the Cape Cod National Seashore. Sphagnum subsecundum Nees. in Sturm., Drepanocladus exannulatus (Guemb.) Warnst. and Fontinalis flaccida Ren & Card. were examined for biomass, tissue nutrients and heavy metal contents. They occurred in water deeper than 7.5 m and showed more living biomass than "dead". Living tissues had higher N, K and B contents than the dead material, but both had similar levels of P. High concentrations of Fe, Al, Na, Ni and Pb were also found. These results are discussed in terms of the general ecology of oligotrophic, clear lakes and the long-lasting stability of these bryophyte communities. ///              .

lindbergia.34.9|A considerable part of black alder swamps in Europe are situated in south Sweden. These swamps are frequently rich in bryophytes, but the variation in species composition is often large between sites. In this study we focus on environmental variables that best predict biodiversity in terms of species number, cover and bryophyte composition. The bryophyte vegetation was analysed in 71 plots of size 10  10 m in 31 black alder swamps from south Sweden. A total number of 171 bryophyte species (including 52 liverwort species) were recorded. At plot level the species number ranged between 11 and 54 (019 for liverworts and 1136 for mosses). The black alder swamps were classified into five groups, which turned out to be characterized by a combination of tree species composition and hydrological conditions. 22 environmental and geographic variables were recorded for each plot and used as predictor variables in a redundancy analysis (RDA). These variables explained about 50% of the distribution of bryophytes. The most influential variables along the first axis were slope (positive relationship), basal area of spruce (positive relationship) and basal area of black alder (negative relationship). Along the second axis slope, basal area of ash and water depth had the strongest impact. The variables were subdivided into four groups and analyzed by separate RDAs. The amount of dead wood was important for the species richness in black alder fens in combination with humidity. Epixylic bryophytes tended to occupy spruce dead wood as a primary substrate and alder dead wood as a secondary substrate if spruce is present. Black alder stools were important as substrate for various bryophytes during flooding periods, including
27809542|We examined the influence of a feather mossmat on the occurrence and growth of Abies veitchii seedlings on a forest site and a windfall site on Mt. Fuji, central Japan. Smaller seedlings occurred relatively infrequently on the mossmat on both sites. A negative relationship between seedling occurrence and the mossmat was established only on the forest site. The relationship greatly strengthened as seedling height increased on the forest site, but leveled off from the early developmental stage on the windfall site. Seedling growth decreased on the mossmat on both sites, more so for smaller seedlings inhabiting a deep position in the mossmat. The results indicated that the mossmats hinder initial seedling establishment by intercepting light, but enhance seedling survival by providing shelter. We conclude that the mossmat forms a seedbed which enables A. veitchii to regenerate successfully and thereby by maintain its predominance in the forest.
20149833| Sphagnum (Acutifolia) rubiginosum Flatb. is recognized in the field by its branch fascicles which have predominantly, three divergent branches with narrow leaves, by capitula with a fairly distinct terminal bud and branches which are commonly brown-red to red-brown, and by autoicy and the abundant occurrence of sporophytes. Microscopically, it is recognized by lingulate-spathulate to spathulate and truncate-fimbriate stem leaves possessing large and often multiseptate hyalocysts in their upper portion and narrow to only moderately expanded borders below, by divergent branch leaves with pauci- to aporose hyalocysts in their apical convex portion, and by a multiporose outer stem cortex. The new species is most similar to S. girgensohnii. It is known from many localities in western Norway, from Washington and Alaska in U.S.A., and from British Columbia in Canada. Most Norwegian records are from humid, shaded spruce forests. Plants similar to S. rubiginosum also occur in eastern Asia but their taxonomy has to be investigated further.

20149488|A survey of the bryoflora of the northern part of the province of Friesland is given; 70 mosses and 5 hepatics were found. This region along the Wadden Sea is particularly rich in so called clay-mosses. Also the pure sea-air provides a refugium for epiphytic species. Many of these taxa have decreased heavily in the Netherlands in this century because of the deteriorating quality of air and rain. The species list contains notes on substrate and local frequency.
20150243|The taxonomic status of the brown-coloured, arctic taxon of the Sphagnum fimbriatum Wils. group is reevaluated based on Greenlandic and Svalbard material. Based on a combination of morphological, geographical and ecological characteristics, it is found to be best distinguished as a species of its own, viz. S. concinnum (Berggr.) Flatberg. PCA morphometric comparisons of stem leaf variables show that S. concinnum can be significantly distinguished from boreal and subarctic/southern arctic plants of S. fimbriatum by its more rectangular-spathulate and less obovate stem leaves with less extent of marginal fimbriation along their distal part margins. Sphagnum concinnum seems to be confined in distribution to the arctic zone, but its total distribution is somewhat uncertain. It is primarily a monoecious species. The species is for the first time recorded with sporophytes. The arctic species Sphagnum olafii Flatberg and S. tundrae Flatberg are recorded as new to the Greenlandic peat moss flora. This represents the first and only record of S. olafii from outside Svalbard. It was found to be dioecious. Previously it has been reported with diploid gametophores from Svalbard and its hybridogenous origin is morphologically hypothesized relative to possible parental taxa occurring at present in Greenland.

20149403|Since 1941 a local working group investigates the bryophyte flora of Amsterdam and surroundings. A list is given of the bryophyte flora of marshes (peat moors), marshy hayfields, marine deposits in reed swamps, clay- and basaltdikes, granite boulders and bricks, on walls, wood along ditches and roads and on the trees. Based on literature and own collections 180 species of bryophytes are reported. Cryphaea heteromalla, in the Netherlands almost entirely confined to old Sambucus-shrubs in calcareous coastal dunes, was recorded on a stone-wall. Ptilidium pulcherrimum and Seligeria recurvata were found on a sandstone block at a storage yard in Amsterdam. Loeskeobryum brevirostre, rare in the Netherlands, grew in a swampy vegetation, together with Sphagnum riparium, which is known only from a few other places in the Netherlands. Other noteworthy finds include Tortella tortuosa, Ulota phyllantha, Aloina rigida and Fissidens bryoides ssp. incurvus.
20150155|To test the genetic relationship between alpine and subalpine forms of Hylocomium splendens, pairwise sampling was undertaken of populations from four areas, representing the southern and northern ranges of the Scandes. From each population I sampled 75 shoots in a hierarchical fashion, and these were screened for variation at 12 allozyme loci. The pairwise genetic identity (I) among subalpine and alpine populations was, respectively, 0.970 and 0.972, versus 0.946 between the altitudinal groups. This suggests that populations from subalpine and alpine zones are genetically differentiated. The total gene diversity (
27809535|A fossil assemblage from Store Koldewey (75557645N, 18271910W), deposited 1.82.6 million years ago, includes almost 50 moss taxa. Hamatocaulis vernicosus (Mitt.) Hedens and possibly Hygrohypnum montanum (Lind.) Broth. have not been previously found in Greenland either as fossils or extant populations. Although many of the recovered fossil mosses are widespread species, there is a significant component of temperate species, or alpine in addition to temperate species, suggesting a considerably milder climate than today. The wetland taxa suggest relatively mineral-poor habitats, indicating an origin in the western part of the island, where the bedrock is acidic gneiss. The occurrence of many arctic or arctic-alpine mosses in North American deposits older than 3 to 4 million years indicates that these species evolved before the start of more intensive glaciations of the present Arctic and before the bulk of the arctic flora supposedly evolved.

In spite of these difficulties, S. subfulvum must be regarded as a taxon; however, further investigation is needed to determine its taxonomical rank. ///      Sphagnum subfulvum  S. subnitens    32  (349 )    .     , , ,     ,         .    , S. subfulvum   . , ,  ,     . 
20150167| Scorpidium revolvens is a typical species of intermediate and moderately rich fens, while it is absent from calcareous, extremely rich fens. Field data indicates that the distribution of S. revolvens is even more limited in relation to magnesium than to calcium. I conducted a laboratory growth experiment to reveal the effects of magnesium and calcium on the growth of S. revolvens. S. revolvens growth appears unrelated to hardness (CaCO+MgCO; 0.1 and 0.5 mmol l) and Mg:Ca ratio (0.1, 1, 4, 9), while their interaction had a significant effect on the total length growth. The interaction was interpreted in terms of a significant effect of calcium concentration. Growth showed a unimodal response to calcium but no response to magnesium. A gaussian model explained 81% of variation in mean length growth and indicated a growth optimum at 7.6 mg l Ca. The results indicate that the absence of S. revolvens from calcareous rich fens is explainable by its narrow fundamental niche along the calcium gradient, while its absence from magnesium rich fens cannot be explained by growth inhibition by magnesium.

More exact circumscriptions are given of several differentiating characters which were already established by previous authors. In C. fissa and C. sphagnicola the areolation of the leaves appeared to be a new differentiating character: in C. fissa the cells in the middle of the leaf show a great variation in length, whereas in C. sphagnicola the cell size is uniform. These differences are shown in histograms. C. muelleriana appeared to be restricted to the diluvial parts of the country, whereas C. fissa is common on both alluvium and diluvium; C. neesiana, C. sphagnicola and C. trichomanis are very rare, so that no clear geographical distribution can be given.

Now it occurs in 16 regions and the number of localities has increased from 13 to 32. The habitat preference of the species hardly changed during its expansion; it occurs mainly in Salix mires. At many of its recent localities, S. fimbriatum has a pioneer character; it has colonised earlier known (and well-studied) sites, or occupied new, young habitats. Due to the characteristic field morphology and very intensive earlier bryological studies it may be safely assumed that S. fimbriatum has expanded its distribution in Hungary. This expansion is observable both at local and regional spatial scales and the direction seems to be from the mountain region to the lowlands. The expansion of S. fimbriatum could be attributed to good sexual and vegetative reproduction and strong colonising and growth ability in more stressed and disturbed habitats. Other Sphagna do not show similar changes in their distribution and frequency.
23595415|The globally disjunct liverwort Scapania nimbosa is only known from eastern Himalaya and northwestern Europe. Scapania nimbosa has since 1907 only been known from one locality in Norway. After reinvestigation of the locality in 1998 it was suspected to be extinct due to mining activity in the area. However, new investigations in 2003 revealed a new locality and further investigations up to present have resulted in 26 populations including 144 patches being found. All known populations are lying within an area of about 12  20 km, 520 km from the outer coast line, 200550 m a.s.l., in north facing mountains slopes in Frna, Eide and Gjemnes municipalities, Mre and Romsdal county. The climate is euoceanic, with mild winters (January mean temperature near 0C), heavy precipitation (yearly >2000 mm) and 220250 days per year with >0.1 mm precipitation. Fog formation around the mountains is common and is believed to be important. Scapania nimbosa was found at less than 50% of the seemingly suitable localities, and we suggest that the extent of occurrence is restricted by dispersal. Scapania nimbosa is red-listed both in Norway and Europe, and possible threats are discussed.

20149345| The moss Bryhnia novae-angliae (Sull. et Lesq.) Grout is shown to be fairly wide-spread in West Norway north to 6316. Its distribution fits well into an element of species with a southern and western (suboceanic) distribution pattern, and coincides with the region of boreo-nemoral deciduous woods to which it belongs ecologically. Most finds are from moist Alnus glutinosa woods or from well-drained Alnus incana woods on alluvial plains. At all localitics the field and bottom layers consist of demanding species.

20149684| A revised annotated checklist comprising 42 moss taxa for subantarctic Heard Island is presented. A summary of their phytogeographical distributions is provided. All flora has reached Heard Island via some form of transoceanic dispersal. The size of the moss flora is small compared with other subantarctic islands. Heard Island is more than 80% ice covered and the paucity of the flora reflects restricted diversity and limited availability of suitable habitats. ///     ,  42     e .     .       -   .          .    80%  ,            . 
20149785| The delimitations and taxonomic positions of the genera Calliergonella Loeske and Breidleria Loeske are discussed, based on numerous characters not considered in this context before. Calliergonella includes C. cuspidata (Hedw.) Loeske and C. lindbergii (Mitt.) Hedens, comb. nov. (Hypnum lindbergii Mitt.). Breidleria includes B. pratensis (Koch ex Spruce) Loeske and B. erectiuscula (Sull. & Lesq.) Hedens, comb. nov. (Hypnum erectiusculum Sull. & Lesq.). The species of the two genera differ, i.a., in the capsule shape (swollen when moist and furrowed when dry in Calliergonella vs not swollen when moist, smooth when dry in Breidleria), the endostome cilia (appendiculate vs nodose), the appearance of the exostome border (strongly vs slightly widened at transition zone), the appearance of the margin of stem and perichaetial leaves (not or slightly vs more strongly denticulate), the appearance of the alar group (numerous cells in a large well defined group vs few cells in an indistinct group) and in the shape of the pseudoparaphyllia (broad and obtuse vs narrow and lanceolate). The Calliergonella species differ from those of Hypnum, i.a., in having appendiculate cilia and in the large groups of strongly inflated alar cells. The species of Breidleria are close to some Hypnum species, but due to a combination of characters, including the large size, the flattened foliage of the stem, the hyalodermis of the stem and the tendency to grow in moist or wet habitats, the genus Breidleria is considered distinct. Hypnum dieckii Ren. & Card. is excluded from Breidleria on the basis of its different chromosome number, its larger spores, its different capsule shape, its more thin-walled exothecial cells and its more strongly coloured leaf bases. Finally, the familial position of the genera is discussed. ///       Calliergonella Loeske  Breidleria Loeske,          . Calliergonella  C. cuspidata (Hedw.) Loeske  C. lindbergii (Mitt.)

20149370|The Hompelvoet is a sand flat in the former sea-arm Grevelingen, which has been embanked in 1971. First colonization by bryophytes was observed in 1972. In subsequent years gradually more species appeared. Among the main colonising species, the ephemeral Funaria hygrometrica was followed by colonists such as Bryum bicolor and B. argenteum. On the driest, completely desalinated parts the development was stopped at this stage. In slightly moister parts several species from moist dune valleys such as Bryum algovicum spp. ruthei became established. On the eastern parts of the flat, the soil contains more silt. Consequently, the top soil is more constantly moist and remains brackish. Here Pottia heimii is the dominant bryophyte. The patterns observed show strong resemblance to those described from the former Lauwerszee and other comparable areas.
20149357| Cytological and taxonomical research in the family Mniaceae is reviewed with special emphasis on chromosome numbers, karyotypes and their evolution, and polyploidy. From this, it is hoped, will be established a clear understanding of the Mniaceae including the interrelationships of the included genera and species. Thirty-one of the 47 listed species have been cytologically studied by this author. In these studies meristematic tissue of the gametophyte was used for squash preparations for obtaining chromosome counts and karyotype information. Species-pairs are recognized and each member given specific status because of their morphological differences as well as their independent self-maintenance in nature. The genus Pseudobryum has been reduced to the level of a section in the genus Plagiomnium and the appropriate new species combinations made, P. cinclidioides (Hb.) M. C.

20150125| Moss remains in a sediment sample from Narsaarsuk near the Thule Air Base, NW Greenland (76 27 N, 69 35 W), were identified to obtain insights into vegetation and environmental conditions 119-123 ka BP. Thirty-two taxa were identified, seven of which had not been found as subfossils on Greenland before. Comparisons with modern habitats and geographical distributions of the mosses suggest the following. (1) The environment was mostly mineral-rich. (2) Terrestrial habitats had a sparse vegetation with mostly disturbance-tolerant species.. (3) At least some wetland habitats were somewhat nutrient-enriched, indicating that they were close to the sea or possibly bird cliffs. (4) The climate was arctic, but the summer had a longer period of above-zero mean temperatures than at present. The bryophyte finds support earlier published evidence from animal and vascular plant remains concerning influence by the sea and climate.

20150154|We present an overview of the bryophyte flora of five West Frisian Islands: Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog. These islands comprise the most natural areas in the Netherlands and large parts are nature reserves. Over the last century the total number of bryophyte species recorded on the islands has increased rapidly, partly as a result of the increasing presence of woodlands and scrub. Of greatest bryological value are the calcareous wet dune slacks where many Red Data List species can be found. However, 7 out of 24 Red Data List species of these slacks have not been seen recently on the islands. Important causes of this decline are natural succession to less calcareous habitats, increasing vegetation cover, and extraction of drinking water on some islands. The dry grasslands and especially the north slopes of the dunes form another important habitat for rare bryophytes. Although the bryophytes of these grasslands suffer from changing vegetation structure and acidification of the top-soil, most rare species are still present on the islands. There is a strong suggestion that climate changes also influence the species composition of the bryophytes on these islands.
20150185|We screened six populations of the clonal forest floor moss Plagiomnium affine from forests of different ages for genetic variation at 23 allozyme loci.

20149881| Sphagnum tenellum was found mainly at sites below 1200 m a.s.l. with a mean annual precipitation of more than 1500 mm, and a mean annual temperature of 5-8C. Sphagnum compactum is mostly restricted to areas above 1000 m, occurs frequently at locations with a mean annual temperature below 0C, and grows well on bare peat. Niche-overlap (calculated by Levins' equation) is low for altitude and temperature, but high for frequency and quantity of precipitation and for snow-cover. In relation to other Sphagnum species S. tenellum shows narrow niche breadth for all habitat classes. Niche overlap is high between S. tenellum and S. cuspidatum, and between S. compactum and S. subsecundum. In sparsely populated habitats both mosses form single-species mats. In competition with other species S. tenellum survives mainly as single-stem individuals within loose mats of other plants, whereas S. compactum is often replaced by more competitive Sphagna. In an ordination by Detrended Correspondence Analysis, S. compactum shows relations to other bare peat species (Gymnocolea inflata), while the position of S. tenellum in the ordination diagram is similar to species like Rhynchospora alba, Sphagnum centrale and S. cuspidatum.

20149331| Growth rates and metal contents (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu) of moss carpets were studied in southern Finland in seven Picea abies forests with a thin peat layer. The increment lengths for 1976 and 1977 were greater in the species growing in wet microhabitats (Sphagnum girgensohnii, Polytrichum commune) as opposed to the species occurring in somewhat drier microsites (Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum majus). Net annual dry matter production of S. girgensohnii averaged 191 g m, while the corresponding mean value for P. schreberi was significantly lower (98 g m). In vertical moss profiles, Cu and Zn concentrations decreased in P. commune from young to old segments, while in the other four species the levels of all metals increased with the age of moss, most steeply for Fe and least for Cu. On dry weight basis, the concentrations of Cu, Pb, Fe and Mn were lower in the green portion of Sphagnum than in Pleurozium (or other feather mosses). On an area basis, however, Sphagnum stands annually retained equal or higher amounts of the metals studied than the Pleurozium carpets. ///       Picea abies            (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu)  .   1976-77 .    ,     (Sphagnum girgensohnii, Polytrichum commune)    ,       (Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum majus).

The distinction between L. hyperborea and the related L. floerkei, L. quadriloba and L. atlantica is discussed. The recent find from SW-Greenland causes a slight broadening of the concept of the perimeters of L. hyperborea. All known records of L. hyperborea are mapped.
20149724| Concentrations of 6 elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, S) were measured in surface cores of hummock growing Sphagnum species and in the water that accumulated below each core. Cores were taken from a wide variety of peatland types in four climatic zones in westem Canada. Calcium, Mg, Fe, and Na concentrations in the cores increased or remained the same with increasing depth. Potassium and S concentrations decreased with depth. Among elements studied, only Ca and Mg concentrations in surface water are related to concentrations in the moss. Such species as S. rubellum, S. pacificum, S. angustifolium, and S. warnstorfii that form small hummocks (height &lt10 cm), lawns, and carpets are never isolated from Ca and Mg concentrations in surface water. Effects of Ca and Mg in surface water on concentrations in such species as S. fuscum, S. austinii, S. papillosum, S. capillifolium and S. magellanicum, that form taller hummocks (height &gt10 cm), were not significant under conditions of moisture surpluses and highly significant for monthly periods of moisture deficits. ///    (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, S)       ,      ,    .               .

20149914|The extensive scattered literature on Hepaticae of the north of the Holarctic, in large part in Russia, is surveyed. The geographical distribution of a large number of taxa is discussed and in part amplified by the inclusion of unpublished locality data. The distribution patterns show sufficient variation that no general, unified theory is possible to account for all of the patterns seen. However, the accumulated data clearly show there is an extensive Arctic hepatic flora, much of which had been described from the American Arctic, which occurs, at least in lacunose fashion, from Siberia into European Russia. It is concluded that a considerable endemic Arctic flora exists, of diverse origin, but is in large part a flora that survived the Pleistocene in high-Arctic environments. Ultimately, the innate capacity to disseminate seems more critical in explaining current distribution of taxa in the far north than any scheme that relies only on periglacial survival for explanation.

20149652| Fluctuations in the cover, biomass and nutrient content (N, P, K) of bryophytes were followed during one year in five chalk grasslands in South Limburg (The Netherlands), while biomass was recorded once in five additional chalk grasslands. Biomass was higher on north-facing slopes than on south-facing slopes, probably because north-facing soils have a higher average moisture content. The biomass increased in the following order: abandoned grasslands -- grasslands burnt once a year -- grasslands mown in autumn -- grasslands grazed by sheep. The bryophytes, with biomass values up to circa 0.6 ton ha and cover values up to 60%, always formed a pattern consisting of dense patches interspersed with open spots. The biomass of the bryophytes is highest in autumn and spring whereas the biomass of the phanerogams reaches its lowest values during this time of the year. We suggest that the nutrient content of the bryophyte layer affects the nutrient cycle of the whole system. ///   ,     (N, P, K)               (),             .        ,      ,  ,          .      :   -      -    - ,   .       0.6         60%,   ,    ,    .       ,               .  ,           .

20149844| This study investigates the effects of simulated acid rain on twelve morphological variables, segment dry weight and chlorophyll content in the pleurocarpous moss Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) B.S.G. Permanent plots (50  50 cm) dominated by H. splendens were established in a spruce forest in Central Norway and assigned at random to one of six treatment groups. Treatments consisted of twice-monthly spraying with simulated acid rain of pH 2.5, 3.0, 4.0 or 5.6 from July to October, 1987 and from May to October, 1988. Unsprayed plots served as controls. Spray solutions were composed of deionized water adjusted to the different pH levels by a mixture of HSO and HNO in the molar ratio 2:1. A reduction in segment length, branch length, number of branches, segment dry weight and chlorophyll content was observed with increasing acidity in the spray treatments at pH &lt 4.0. ///           ,          Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.

20149592| A similar pattern of sporeling development is shared by Pallavicinia subciliata, Symphyogyna aspera, and Podomitrium phyllanthus. This pattern is characterized by a two to few-celled filamentous stage, the growth of which is terminated by the production of an apical cell with two cutting faces. Limited segmentation of this cell and subsequent irregular divisions within both its derivatives and the basal cells, results in a juvenile plant composed of a cylindrical axis and massive basal region. The most significant variation in the development of these sporelings is seen in the time of sporoderm rupture. In Symphyogyna, the exospore is broken before any divisions occur, while in the remaining taxa, the spore wall usually stretches with the developing sporeling and is ruptured after a variable number of cell divisions. Variation in culture conditions influenced the rates of germination and the frequency of occurrence of a filamentous phase in Podomitrium. ///       Pallavicinia subsiliata, Symphyogyna aspera  Podomitrium phyllanthus.             ,           .     , ,      ,     ,    ,         .             .

20149633|Glyphomitrium daviesii (With.) Brid. is shown to produce gemmae from rhizoids on older parts of the stem throughout its distributional area. The gemma usually consists of one row of cells, but is sometimes branched. In mature gemmae the wall is two-layered with a brown smooth inner layer and a hyaline, thick, very irregular outer layer. The presence of chlorophyll in the brown gemmae is demonstrated by use of fluorescence microscopy.
20149998| Orthotrichum vermiferum Lewinsky-Haapasaari (subg. Pulchella (Schimp.) Vitt sect. Diaphana Vent.) sp. nov. is described from the Qinghai province, China. It is recognized by double peristomes with 16 teeth strongly ornamented by vermicular lines, as well as 16 biseriate, roughly papillose segments, hairy vaginulae, and large spores (30-32 m). It is an epiphyte collected from Ribes twigs at 2680 m elevation. Orthomitrium schofieldii Tan & Jia, previously only known from the type collection, is reported from four new localities in the Qinghai province; the species is illustrated and shown to have double peristomes and sinistrorse dry setae, the latter supporting a systematic placement in the subfamily Orthotrichoideae tribe Orthotricheae.

The mitotic chromosome count of (n=13) for S. intermedia Brid. Does not correspond with with a previous report concerning this species from France giving n=12. S. princeps (De Not.)Mitt. showed the same chromosome number (n=26) as a previous study of Turkish material. The mitotic chromosome number of S. ruraliformis (Besch.) Cardot.

20150176|The sand-steppe is a vegetation type mainly found in the southern Baltic region on calcareous sand dominated by vascular plants such as Koeleria glauca, Dianthus arenarius ssp. arenarius and Astragalus arenarius. Eighty-eight plots representing most sand-steppe sites in Scania, southernmost Sweden, were analyzed with respect to bryophytes, pH and exchangeable phosphate in the topsoil. The most common species were Syntrichia ruraliformis, Hypnum lacunosum, Ceratodon purpureus, Brachythecium albicans, Bryum argenteum, Syntrichia ruralis and Racomitrium canescens, but several rare or red-listed taxa were also found. Total species richness was reduced in plots with subneutral topsoil but uniformly high in plots with alkaline topsoil. In these latter, however, concentrations of exchangeable phosphate were found to have a major effect on the bryophyte flora. A significant negative relationship between total species richness and phosphate concentrations was found and most rare species were restricted to, or most frequent in plots with low phosphate availability. Only a few common generalist taxa appeared favoured by high phosphate availability. These findings suggest that management intended to conserve the sand-steppe vegetation should be designed to keep availability of phosphate low. Mechanical soil disturbance should be favoured over heavy grazing and burning.
20150078|The first unambiguous find of Sphagnum viride Flatberg in Sweden is reported. The habitat, a wet hollow in a bog in the large mire complex Kornosse in southern Sweden, was unexpected. S. viride is most often found in minerotrophic fens. Systematically S. viride is close to S. cuspidatum.
20149929|The relationships between 80 species in ca 50 "Hookerialean" genera are evaluated using cladistic methods. These genera were suggested to be related to each other in the literature or in an earlier overview study of the "Hookeriales", the Sematophyllaceae and some other taxa. Two larger clades, corresponding to the families Hookeriaceae and Callicostaceae were identified, in addition to a smaller one corresponding to the small family Leucomiaceae. The exact circumscription of the latter is, however, uncertain. The Daltoniaceae as understood by most recent authors is an ingroup in the Hookeriaceae, and if the Hypopterygiaceae species are related to the "Hookerialean" taxa this must be another ingroup in the same family. Twenty-four characters, eight from the vegetative gametophyte, eight from the sexual branches and eight from the sporophyte, appear to be the most important in circumscribing the two larger clades, and classifications based on only sporophytic or only gametophytic characters are considered unlikely to be correct. Character evolution in the two large families is discussed, and it appears that the common ancestor of the Hookeriaceae and the Callicostaceae had a short double nerve in the vegetative leaves, from which evolved a single, long nerve in the early members of the first family and a double, long nerve in the latter. The somewhat lesser structural stability of the leaves offered by the single nerve present in the Hookeriaceae, compared with the long double nerve in the Callicostaceae, seems to have been compensated for to some degree by the evolution of a well developed leaf border in many members of the first family. Short (in relation to their length) leaf lamina cells evolved in the ancestral Hookeriaceae and several times in the Callicostaceae. Several character states evolved mainly in one of the families, such as a stem hyalodermis, uniseriate basal marginal calyptra hairs and stomata with more than two guard-cells in the Callicostaceae, and many-celled upper portions of the axillary hairs, much-branched rhizoids and internal thickenings of collenchymatous exothecial cells in the Hookeriaceae. Other characters showed parallel evolution in the more apomorphic clades in these two families, for example the loss of vaginular and perigonial paraphyses and the evolution of erect capsules with strongly specialised peristomes.

20150168|This study investigates the conservation status of the redlisted bryophyte Sphagnum angermanicum in Sweden. The majority of the known Swedish localities were visited and population sizes estimated. pH, height above the groundwater table, horizontal distance to mineral ground, associated species and disturbance degree were investigated for each population. Sphagnum angermanicum was found in 19 of the 20 populations visited. Most populations were small, with eight occupying less than 5 m. The populations occurred on mires with mean pH of 4.9, mean height above the groundwater table of 18 cm and mean horizontal distance to the closest mineral ground of 25 m. There was a quadratic relationship between pH and population sizes, where the largest populations were found at intermediate pH (about pH 5). The low number and small sizes of the Swedish populations make them sensitive to environmental changes, stochastic events and deterministic habitat loss. There is thus a clear need for special conservation attention. The species seems to benefit from some kind of fine-scale disturbance like trampling of large mammals and wheel tracks of small cross-country vehicles. A map of the known Scandinavian distribution is presented and discussed in relation to the species' potential dispersal capacity.
lindbergia.35.76|Bryophytes have until now been absent from all hypotheses regarding the origin of insect pollination of seed plants. The discovery that both springtails and mites are able to transfer sperm in mosses makes it possible to suggest a 'Bryophyte precursor hypothesis of plant pollination' stating that animal-mediated fertilization in mosses and insect pollination in seed plants is historically linked by homologous or analogous evolution of structures responsible for attraction and reward aimed at a pool of fertilization vectors originally co-evolved with bryophytes and subsequently co-opted by seed plants. The earliest point in time when animal-mediated fertilization of bryophytes, involving springtails and mites, could have arisen is Late Silurian/Early Devonian, ca 280 Myr before the evolutionary radiation of angiosperms.
20149880| Warnstorfia trichophylla is reported from two localities in central parts of West Greenland.

20150006|The distribution of a species occurring in patchy habitats is mainly dominated by its dispersal abilities, the time interval of patch availability, and the inter-patch distance. An increase in distance or a decrease in patch size will have a negative influence on the size of bryophyte populations. However, in this paper we show that when distances between discrete patches are small, the distribution of the species of interest is mainly determined by the suitability of the different substrate types present and their distribution. The habitat parameters (substrate type, tree diameter and tree density) potentially explain 48% of the distribution pattern for Ulota crispa in the study area, whereas dispersal-related parameters (spatial co-ordinates and again tree density) hold a potential explanation of 36%. Of this 29% is overlapping in potential explanation. The distribution of Ulota crispa sensu lato within this study area is correlated most with the distribution of Salix caprea, Populus tremula and Fraxinus excelsior, and to some extent with Sorbus aucuparia and Acer pseudoplatanus. Betula pubescens, a prominent species within the study area, is regarded as a poor substrate, although a number of U. crispa cushions grow on it. The source of these cushions is probably neighbouring trees with better substrate characteristics. The models concerning population viability in relation to patchiness must incorporate the dispersal ability of the species, the distribution of different substrates, the time interval of availability of the particular habitat, the suitability of the different substrate types, and a parameter describing the relation of these variables to changing scales both in time and space.
20149372|The distribution of Polytrichastrum alpinum (Hedw.) G. L. Smith in Denmark and northern Europe is shown. In Denmark the species is confined to steep north-facing sandy slopes in northwestern Jutland and its distribution suggests that high summer temperatures prevent it from spreading further southwards. P. alpinum has migrated into its present Danish sites after about 5000 BC.
20149869| The seasonal variation in growth and nitrogen uptake and assimilation were studied in Dicranum majus Sm. growing in two Picea abies (L.) Karst. forests, one located in southern and the other in central Norway. The atmospheric nitrogen wet deposition was 10 times higher in southern than in central Norway during the investigated period. Growth and nitrogen uptake rates were highest in the population from central Norway, and seemed to be positively correlated with water supply at the two investigated sites. Concentrations and total amounts of nitrogen, soluble protein and chlorophyll were, however, highest in moss plants from the high-N site in southern Norway. Nitrogen and soluble protein concentrations varied, whereas chlorophyll concentrations remained stable during the investigated period. It is suggested that a high atmospheric nitrogen deposition in southern Norway has led to elevated nitrogen concentrations in D. majus due to luxury consumption and nitrogen accumulation. However, further studies under controlled conditions are needed to evaluate the effects of genetic and environmental factors on growth, nitrogen uptake and thus nitrogen concentrations in mosses. ///             Dicranum majus Sm.,    Picea abies (L.)

20150201|BRYOPLANET, a bryophyte population and landscape analysis network, was funded by the Nordic Research Board (Nordforsk) from 2001-2005 to arrange scientific meetings, workshops and courses for researchers and students on bryophyte ecology in the Nordic and Baltic countries. It provided a tool for connecting bryologists in the region and elsewhere. The network succeeded in connecting experienced researchers' broad knowledge with young enthusiastic post-graduate students with fresh ideas. In the final meeting of the network in Kked, Hungary on 19-22 August, 2005 and during the post-meeting excursion on 22-25 August, 2005, the present state of research was discussed with a strong emphasis on identifying the highlights and also the weaknesses in the many fields of bryophyte ecology today. The meeting consisted of seven invited retrospective lectures, offered by specialists in different fields of bryophyte ecology, and researchers and students had an opportunity to present ongoing projects to the audience. In addition to the lectures, the meeting consisted of 15 presentations ranging from phylogeographic patterns to morphological adaptations, population dynamics and genetics. Retrospective lectures have been published, along with some of the original papers presented at the Kked meeting. This introduction presents and evaluates the history, aims and outcomes of the BRYOPLANET network in addition to reporting on the final meeting in Kked.

20149549| Photosynthesis in certain forest and peat mosses (Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum majus, Sphagnum fuscum, S. angustifolium, S. nemoreum, S. magellanicum) was measured at various CO concentrations (250-1000 ppm). Net CO exchange rose almost linearly with increasing CO concentration. The percentage increase in the net CO exchange became greater with rising temperature. The photosynthetic optimum temperature was approx. 15C at 320 ppm CO and 20-25C at 1000 ppm. The relative increase in net CO exchange caused by rising CO concentrations was virtually independent of the irradiation in the range 70-500 mol m s PAR. The nature of the response to CO concentration at optimum moisture conditions was similar in all the species. The daily net photosynthesis of S. fuscum was simulated for some days using the environmental conditions prevailing in a drained peatland, a habitat where the daily fluctuation in atmospheric CO is relatively large. This daily CO fluctuation resulted at most in a 6.3% greater daily value than did the use of an even daytime concentration. Doubling of the CO concentration from 320 ppm to 640 ppm raised the daily net CO exchange 1.6-2.6-fold. The figures obtained in the simulation cannot be regarded as an exact prediction concerning growth or production, however, since too little is known about the long-term effects of increased CO. ///        (Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum majus, Sphagnum fuscum, S. angustifolium, S. nemoreum, S. magellanicum)      CO (250-1000   ).

20149996|Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (Hedw.) Warnst., Calliergonella cuspidata (Hedw.) Loeske and Ctenidium molluscum (Hedw.) Mitt., three common pleurocarpous bryophyte species in chalk grasslands, were reciprocally transplanted in the field. Shoots were implanted in dense natural patches as well as in thinned patches and increase in dry weight and in length of the main axis were measured after 7.5 months of growth. Differences in growth were found between the treatments only for shoots of the smallest species, Ctenidium. Increase in dry weight of Ctenidium shoots was restricted in dense patches of Rhytidiadelphus. However, increase in length was not restricted: the morphology of the shoots was adjusted to the tall neighbouring shoots and Ctenidium was not outcompeted by its tall neighbours during the experiment. Growth of Ctenidium was significantly better in thinned plots, where more light is available at sub-canopy level, than in natural plots. Growth of shoots of the two taller species, Rhytidiadelphus and Calliergonella, was independent of the neighbouring species; they were not able to overgrow patches of the smallest species during the course of this experiment. There was no or scarcely any advantage of growing in thinned patches for either Rhytidiadelphus or Calliergonella. Apparently, for these taller species, the positive effect of higher light availability in thinned plots was counteracted by the negative effect of deteriorated water economy.
20149883| Several tuber-bearing moss species may be very abundant in the diaspore bank, while their above-ground populations are extremely sparse. The maintenance of such populations seems to rely completely on occasional recruitment from the tuber bank followed by production of new tubers by the shoots. A simple, spatially explicit, simulation model was constructed to obtain hypotheses of mechanisms responsible for population regulation in such species. The results suggest that density-dependent tuber mortality in the soil is essential in this respect. The fact that at least some tubers are deposited at some (albeit small) distance from the parent shoot due to their production on comparatively long rhizoids also plays an important role. Future experimental work will test these ideas. ///  -         ,         .   , ,         ,      . ,           ,       .  ,             .  ,          ( )   -,            .        .

20111723| Vegetative plants of Pleurozia purpurea Lindb., grown in controlled environmental chambers, demonstrate that previous morphological descriptions of this species are symmetrically incorrect. As Schuster (1965) suggests in P. caledonica (Gottsche) Paris in Pleurozia the water sacs are on the dorsal surface, not the ventral as earlier held. Serial microtome sectioning was done to correlate apical cell structure and early merophyte development with this new interpretation of overall morphology. The apical cell is found to be dolabrate with only two cutting faces, and the developmental pattern of the two lateral segments is unique among the Jungermanniales. Before formation of leaf initials the expansive merophyte is divided into three segments. In each merophyte the dorsal segment undergoes a rapid series of distinctive divisions to form the complex water sac and one-half of the dorsal part of the stem, while the middle and central segments divide somewhat more slowly to form a shortly bifid lobe and one-half of the rest of the stem. Comparisons of early Plagiochila type branch development with this mature developmental pattern suggest that the shape of the apical cell likely influences the division patterns of the merophytes it produces. ///   Pleurozia purpurea Lindb.,      , ,       .

20150098|Matrix population models have, for more than 20 years, been popular analytical tools in studies of vascular plants, but have until recently not been applied to bryophytes. In this review we explain the rationale behind the simplest matrix modelling approaches, and show how to proceed when using such models in studies of bryophytes. Focussing on the life-cycle graph, we show how bryophyte "individuals", or modules, can be followed over time, and use data for Hylocomium splendens to exemplify how such analyses can be performed in practice. It is argued that the coloured-ring tagging technique which has now been successfully applied to bryophyte species of different growth forms and sizes for up to ten years, is applicable to a large range of bryophyte species except the smallest and, thus, that the major obstacle to following fates of bryophyte individuals over extended time periods has now been overcome. With reference to studies of vascular plants, we provide a long list of topics of interest to bryophyte ecology that call for population matrix modelling. We hope bryologists will take the challenge posed by matrix population models, and thereby contribute to bringing bryophyte population biology one more step forward.

20150046|This study provides information on the distribution of bryophytes in Portugal for three different time periods. The data are based on an extensive survey using records published since 1800. A review of the state of the art in bryological research in Portugal is outlined. The data allowed patterns of diversity and endemism among bryophytes to be explored. A provisional 'Gap Analysis' coupled with an analysis of complementary hot spots required for a full representation of all bryophytes in Portugal is presented. The potential for using bryophytes as an indicator group for biodiversity conservation is investigated and compared with data for pteridophytes, reptiles/amphibians and Trichoptera. The data and analyses presented in this paper are expected to provide basic guidelines for further definition of sites with special interest for bryophyte conservation and research.

20149726| The appearance of the axillary hairs has been studied in 200, mainly European species of pleurocarpous mosses. Representative hairs are illustrated for each species and the potential taxonomic value of the axillary hairs is discussed. Many genera which are rather poorly defined today do also include species with different kinds of axillary hairs, although this is not true for all genera which seem unnatural for other reasons. Genera which seem natural, based on other characters are mostly  homogeneous as regards the axillary hairs. Differences between closely related species were noted in some cases. On the other hand, axillary hair structure does not seem to give any good indications as regards which family a species belongs to. The appearance of the axillary hairs does not seem to be strongly related to the ecology of a species, and the present results indicate that the function of the hairs may not be to protect the growing shoot apex with mucilage. It is sugested that the characters of these hairs may be selectively natural. Finally, some hints on the practical use of axillary hairs in determination work are given. ///       ,   ,   .            .  ,    ,        ,       ,      . ,      , ,  , -   .          .      , ,      ,     .    , ,      ,    ,   ,  ,    ,        . ,        .             . 
20150209|Gemma formation in the Bryum bicolor complex is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. The morphology and number of bulbiferous gemmae in leaf axils are the major characters separating Bryum dichotomum Hedw. (incl. B. bicolor Dicks.) from Bryum barnesii Woods. Some authors claim that these characters intergrade and treat B. barnesii as a synonym of B. dichotomum. To evaluate the variability in bulbils shape and number within a population, B. barnesii was studied under controlled conditions. Bulbils were germinated on sterilized soil in a greenhouse and in a climate incubator. Protonemal growth, number of shoots, number of shoots with bulbils and number of bulbils per shoot were counted and the variability of bulbil shape was investigated. The number of bulbils per leaf axil was constant, but the shape of bulbils and leaves showed greater seasonal variability than mentioned in the descriptions of B. barnesii. In the climate incubator, bulbils also developed directly from a dense secondary protonema. Both types of bulbils can float on the water surface for several days and are therefore suitable for long distance dispersal along streams and shorelines with varying water levels. Apart from the number of bulbils per leaf axil, morphological differences between B. barnesii and B. dichotomum are small. Molecular analyses should be used to evaluate the relationship between these taxa.

20150118|Recent collections of Seligeria in the Ural Mts include plants for which we are unable to find any current name. The new species reported here is most closely related to Seligeria brevifolia. Diagnostic features are gymnostomous capsules, small spore sizes, subpercurrent costae, and distinct heterophylly. In Seligeria galinae dwarf males are documented for the first time in the genus which in general is autoicous. All collections are from limestone cliffs in coniferous forests. As currently known, its geographical distribution is restricted to the southern part of the Northern Urals. Holotype in C, isotype in LE, paratypes in MHA and SVER.
20150096|The morphological relationships of Dicranodontium subporodicyton Broth. to Dicranum, Dicranodontium, Metzleria, Chorisodontium, and Campylopus are evaluated. We agree with Frahm that a definitive placement of this taxon will remain doubtful until sporophytes are discovered, but consider it best placed in Campylopus due to 1) presence of simple to multi-branched, reddish brown rhizoids borne on both surfaces of the costa and the stems at the branch bases; 2) costae with ridges or small lamellae on the dorsal surface; 3) leaves with thick-walled, porose upper laminal cells. In North America this taxon occurs primarily on the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, Canada with one locality on Vancouver Island, one on King Island, and one in the southwestern part of the province. A report of the species from southern Alaska is based upon a specimen of Ditrichum flexicaule (Schwgr.) Hampe. The species has also been reported from northwestern Scotland, Sikkim in northeastern India, and Yunnan, China. The position of rhizoidal initials and rhizoid morphology are characters that have been neglected in the Dicranaceae.

20150178| Oncophorus elongatus (I. Hagen) Hedens (Oncophorus wahlenbergii var. elongatus I. Hagen) is a taxon that has been overlooked in northern Europe. The plants are 8-10 cm high, which is larger than those of O. wahlenbergii Brid., and form much looser tufts or grow singly among other bryophytes. Oncophorus elongatus additionally differs from O. wahlenbergii in its longer stem leaves, (3.7--) 4.5-7.2 mm long, which are more spreading than in the latter and more or less flexuose when moist. The leaf bases are also more strongly sheathing and mostly more strongly widened at their shoulder than in O. wahlenbergii, and the costa is broader, 71.5-124.0 m wide near its base. The acumen of the inner perichaetial leaves is longer than in O. wahlenbergii, (1.3--) 1.4-2.8 times as long as the sheathing part, and the spore capsules are larger and have a smaller length-to-width ratio than in the latter, although there is some overlap between the two. Oncophorus elongatus grows mainly in the subalpine and low-alpine zones, most frequently in mineral-poor or sometimes intermediately mineral-rich mires, or on brook and river shores. It seems to occur primarily in suboceanic areas of the Scandinavian mountain range, reaching coastal areas particularly in northern Norway.

20150050|Work started in the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) in 1993 on a Lower Plant Biodiversity Register. The idea did not progress beyond the early stages, but much of the thinking behind it is now being incorporated into the new National Biodiversity Network (NBN). This major initiative seeks to develop a dispersed network of data and expertise to facilitate the flow of information about Britain's flora and fauna in order to conserve and study it more effectively. To apply the NBN to plants, and particularly to bryophytes, the systems used must (a) ask the right questions, (b) be flexible and adaptable and (c) provide regular useful product. The philosophy behind the NBN is to devolve activity to where the expertise is, rather than attempt to create large central data banks. This ties in well with international initiatives promulgated by organisations such as Planta Europa, IUCN and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC). The European Committee for the Conservation of Bryophytes (ECCB) now has an opportunity to use these developing initiatives to promote bryophyte conservation throughout Europe.

20150204|Conservation biology is a discipline that is framed by ecology and biodiversity science on one side, and by management and environmental politics on the other. Conservation is a process that starts with the identification of threatened habitats/species/genotypes, continues with analyses of threats and finally results in actions to ensure the long-term survival of the species. This paper focuses on species conservation, not habitat conservation or conservation of genetic variation, which are equally important and distinct aspects of conservation biology. This paper addresses threats to bryophytes, and provides an evaluation process to determine how threatened a species is, along with suggested actions to conserve bryophytes and bryophyte diversity. The latter includes both the selection of sites for conservation, and some possible approaches for artificially saving species and genetic material for the future.

20149317| An attempt is made to compare bryophyte life histories with recent models of life strategies of animals and phanerogams. Important life history traits in bryophytes include the balance between sexual and asexual reproduction, the reproductive effort spent on both kinds of reproduction, the size and number of the spores, and annual production and standing crop. Age of first reproduction is generally low for asexual reproduction, but low or high for sexual reproduction, depending on the species and the population included. Density-dependent mortality appears to be rare in bryophytes; in some groups of species mortality is for the greater part caused by abiotic environmental stress, whereas in other groups biotic factors such as competition and predation are more prominent. Life expectancy varies from some weeks in extreme ephemerals to hundreds of years; in the longer lived species wide variation in life span of different individuals occurs. Tolerance and avoidance of environmental stress are two distinct alternative possibilities in bryophytes as well as in phanerogams. A preliminary system of six different bryophyte life strategies is presented. It is stressed that the choice of a fitness measure for a species or population should be made in accordance to its life strategy. Finally, some distinctive traits of bryophyte life histories are outlined. ///              ().               ,  ,     ,    ,      .     , ,   ,  ,      .        . ,             /  .         .

20111735|Notes on the distribution, ecology, and variability of the species of Eurhynchium in the Netherlands, following a revision of the herbarium collections. A key is given and maps illustrating the distribution in the Netherlands (dots refer to collections made up to 1920, squares represent more recent collections). After 1920 strikingly less fruiting collections have been made than before of E. striatum (1.5-3 vs. 45-50%), E. praelongum (4-8 vs. 40%), and E. hians (including E. swartzii, 1-2 vs. 12%). As the absolute number of 'fruiting' localities has dropped too, collecting after 1920 covers a larger part of the country (and much more intensively) than before, and changes in collecting habits do not seem to offer a plausible explanation, a true decline of the fertility appears to have taken place. The reason of this decline could not be clearly indicated but a connection between this and the general deterioration of the environment due to human influence seems obvious.
20150197|Morphology, physiology and biomass in two widespread bryophyte species, Hylocomium splendens and Racomitrium lanuginosum, were studied to examine the extent to which different species exhibit similar phenotypic variation patterns within and across regions. Analyses of nine morphological variables, chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, C/N ratio and biomass were conducted in samples from five sites in two geographically separated and climatically different regions, Iceland and northern Sweden. Both species exhibited large between-site variation in morphology, physiology and biomass, but with-in-site variation in morphology was substantially higher in Hylocomium splendens than Racomitrium lanuginosum. Morphological patterns were partly similar, partly different between the species, indicating that the two species respond morphologically to external factors on different scales. The lowest concentrations of chlorophyll and nitrogen were found at the same sites for both species, while the site of highest concentration was not the same. In Hylocomium splendens, chlorophyll content was positively correlated with biomass. Many of the observed relationships between morphological, physiological variables and biomass were species-specific. Our results demonstrate that the two bryophytes exhibit different phenotypic responses to environmental variation.

20149189|The "Kootwijkerzand" is an area of poor inland dunes partly covered by pine woodlands in the central part of The Netherlands. It harbours a comparatively rich liverwort flora, 21 species having been noticed here.

20111737|During the winter 1975-1976 an investigation was made of the bryophyte vegetation on ash trunks in the "Fazantenbos" (near De Steeg, prov. of Gelderland). This wood is situated on the transition from the loamy sand hills of the Veluwe to the valley of the river IJssel, and consists mainly of coppice. A comparison is made with results of other investigations during the past 25 years. A shift to a more acidophytic bryophyte flora is recognized for which the increased acidity of rain water is supposed to be responsible. In connection to this attention is drawn to some recent increases in area of acidophytic mosses and liverworts in the Netherlands.
20149934|To compare species richness and dominance of lichens vs bryophytes, we sampled Alnus rubra, Thuja plicata, and Tsuga heterophylla on the north and south sides in the first, second, and third meters of tree trunks on Ramsay Island. A total of 8 taxa of mosses, 14 of liverworts, 2 of lichens, and 1 fern were recognized. Liverworts were most abundant on the north side and at 1-2m on all three tree species. The rough mat growth form comprised both the highest cover and greatest number of species of bryophyte on each of the three tree species. This study supports the theory that moisture is the primary limiting factor in determining bryophyte vs lichen dominance on conifer bark, with bryophytes dominating in more moist sites.

Estimates of gene diversity were 0.26 for both species, which is a high level of genetic variability compared with phanerogams. The genetic distance was positively correlated with spatial distance. Differences in allozyme frequencies between R. cuspidigerum and R. spectabile were considerably larger than differences within each species. One of the populations of R. cuspidigerum lacked genetic variability, which might be caused by asexual propagation. Maintenance of genetic variation within and origin of differentiation between populations are discussed. Our results reinforce the view that the diplohaplontic Bryophytina possess an evolutionary potential comparable with that of phanerogams. ///      R. spectabile     R. cuspidigerum     .   22     ;   10 .         0.64  R. spectabile, a 0.55  R. cuspidigerum.     0.26   ,            .        .

20149947|110 stands dominated by Norway spruce belonging to the bilberry type (43), mosaic bilberry/small fern type (24), small fern type (21), low herb type (4), and tall fern/tall herb type (18) were investigated for bryophytes. In all stands also a 10  10 m square was analysed, and a comparison is made between the plot and stand sampling methods. A total of 285 bryophytes (96 liverworts, 189 mosses) were found, and the average number of liverworts, mosses and bryophytes increased along a gradient of increasing humidity and nutrient availability from the bilberry type to the tall fern/tall herb type in the order given above. The number of liverworts in each stand varied from 18 to 49 (mean 29.9), the number of mosses from 16 to 67 (mean 37.8), and the number of bryophytes from 41 to 110 (mean 67.6). Eight species occurred in all stands, viz. (in order of increasing abundance) Cephalozia lunulifolia, Tetraphis pellucida, Ptilidium pulcherrimum, Ptilium crista-castrensis, Plagiothecium laetum, Dicranum scoparium, D. majus and Hylocomium splendens. The life strategies of the bryophytes are presented with regard to occurrence in ecological groups, constancy classes, forest types and successional stage (cutting classes). When all species are considered they belong to the colonist (47.4%), perennial (30.9%) and two shuttle (21.8%) life strategy categories.

20149186|The herbarium collections of Odontoschisma denudatum and O. sphagni from The Netherlands have been revised in connection with a study of the phenotypic variation and ecology of these species. In O. denudatum two natural modifications can be distinguished. Mod. pachyderma is more common and grows in young, open Erica-Calluna heath vegetation, on sandy ridges and rarely on tree trunks. Mod. mesoderma occurs in old, often N-exposed (Erica-)Calluna heath vegetation on shaded substrates. O. sphagni is far more common than O. denudatum and morphologically less variable. It is a characteristic species of oligotrophic bogs and wet heath vegetation. Rarely O. sphagni grows on tree trunks or in rather dry heath vegetation together with O. denudatum mod. mesoderma. In these atypical habitats O. sphagni remains a distinct species, readily distinguished from O. denudatum by the absence of gemmae.

20150038|This paper considers the concept of rarity in bryophytes from two inter-related viewpoints: 1) distribution and abundance, and 2) a complex of factors relating to population biology and extent of genetic variation. A series of questions is posed, a fundamental one being "why do we wish to conserve rare species?". Following Rabinowitz, a species may be classed as rare if its distribution fits one of the three criteria of narrow or highly disjunctive geographical range, high habitat specificity, or consistently low population size. Some species are rare on all three counts. Others are classed as rare when they fit two or even only one of these criteria. Most species would be considered rare on this basis. There is evidence of correlation between rarity and failure to produce sporophytes, among species of both mosses and liverworts. This relationship holds good only for dioecious taxa, however, and thus it is not clear to what extent rarity results from restricted diversity among genotypes consequent upon a bypassing of meiosis. Some rare bryophytes are long-lived perennials, but many are colonist or shuttle species with relatively short-lived gametophytes. Provision of successional habitats will be essential in their conservation management. Some rare species may be phylogenetically isolated. while other may be members of large assemblages of closely related, possibly currently evolving species in genera such as Bryum. Molecular studies, such as our work on the striking pattern of variation within the cosmopolitan species Bryum argenteum, have shown that many common bryophyte species exhibit greater degree of genetic diversity than might be expected in haploid-dominant organisms. This raises the question whether conserving races of common but genetically variable taxa such as B. argenteum might not be at least as valuable as conserving some rare but more uniform species that are closely related to common ones. It also emphasises that our efforts should be directed towards maintaining the largest possible areas of natural and semi-natural vegetation as reservoirs of genetic diversity at the population level, as well as towards conserving priority species.

20149928|Anomobryum lusitanicum (I. Hag. ex Luis.) Thr., an endemic moss from the Iberian Peninsula, is characterized by the appressed, imbricate, scarcely concave leaves with excurrent nerves. As in most Anomobryum species, this moss has leaves with narrow, incrassate vermicular upper leaf cells. The capsules of A. lusitanicum are ovoid to pyriform, with large apophyses that are shorter than the urn, and with reduced peristomes. Filiform rhizoidal gemmae are sometimes developed at the ends of caulinar rhizoids. This type of specialized vegetative propagule is only referred to this species of Anomobryum. New information is presented on peristome and gemma morphology, ecological conditions and geographical distribution.

20150040|We examine relationships between reproductive system, sporophyte and asexual propagule production and rarity for the 289 species comprising the British hepatic flora. Contingency analyses reveal that 1) a much higher proportion of non-fruiting species is rare than of those which do fruit in Britain, 2) a higher proportion of dioecious than of monoecious species fails to produce sporophytes, and 3) among species which do produce sporophytes a much higher proportion of monoecious than dioecious species is rare. Dioecious and monoecious species therefore show different relationships between sporophyte production and rarity, with most rare dioecious species failing to produce sporophytes in Britain while most monoecious rare species produce them at least occasionally. Dispersal limitation is thus a possible cause of rarity for dioecious hepatics, but is not a tenable explanation for rarity in monoecious taxa. A possible explanation is that monoecious taxa become rare through the erosion of genetic variation by inbreeding, but no data exist at present to support this hypothesis. These findings are compared with a previous study of British mosses that arrived at similar conclusions. Production of asexual propagules shows no demonstrable association with rarity category or sexual system, but species that produce neither asexual propagules nor spores constitute the category most likely to be rare.
20150228|We present a method that permits the retrospective assessment of frequency changes in species, based on the evaluation of specimens in biological collections. The method assumes that the increase and decrease in the frequency of a species is reflected in the number of collected specimens. A comparison of the specimen numbers from different time periods allows for an evaluation of the frequency changes of a particular species, provided that the specimen numbers are corrected for the general collecting activity of each time period. We used a reference data set consisting of 10 521 specimens of 85 species to reflect general collecting activity. For 42 species of bryophytes in Switzerland, we calculated the 'relative collecting activity', i.e. the number of specimens of an individual species as a percentage of the number of specimens from the reference data set. We examined changes in the relative collecting activity between the periods 1850-1939 and 1940-1999, using a permutation test. The calculated results were further assessed, taking all background information on each single species into account. In seven cases, the resulting assessments differed from the test results. According to the assessments, 16 species showed a decline and four had increased. The frequency of seven species was considered stable. For the remaining 15, mainly rare species, reliable assessments depend on further study of their former and actual frequencies. When species analysed were arranged into three classes of rare, medium and high frequency, the results showed that the rare and medium frequency species underwent significant decline, whereas the common species were stable. The fact that 12 species of medium or high frequency have most probably declined is of particular interest.

20149964|Forty species were selected from the Swedish Bryophyte Red List in order to test the new IUCN Criteria with help from the guidelines proposed in this issue of Lindbergia. The species were selected to represent different distribution types, morphology types, life strategies, habitats and threats. The results show that out of 40 species selected from the old Red List (following the old IUCN categories), all but one of the Data Deficient species were now considered to be Red List species, according to the new IUCN system. Among the old 25 "Threatened" species (E, V, R) 18 (72%) are still classified as "Threatened". Among the 14 species formerly considered to be "Care demanding", eight were now considered truly "Threatened" (CR, EN, VU) according to the new system. The remaining species met the criteria for Lower Risk (nt). This indicates that using the new system may result in somewhat longer Red Lists than the old one. Most problems with the application of the new system to bryophytes concern the interpretation of the terms 'area of occupancy', 'length of generation', and how to define an 'individual'. The way bryophytes often reproduce by cloning and other forms of asexual dispersal makes them difficult to fit into a category system that pays so much attention to mature individuals and length of generations. Rate of decline was discussed and a frequently used option was to estimate the decline of habitat quality and/or contraction of habitats important for the survival of species. Aspects of reproductive capability and dispersal ability would have been important to consider but are missing in the system. To conclude, the new IUCN threat categories are applicable to bryophytes. The most useful options seems to be to predict decline and estimate rarity with help from distribution and habitat data.

20150062|The composition and diversity of the bryophyte flora of four 13-yr-old windthrow gaps and their adjacent forest stands was studied in the Bavarian Forest National Park, south eastern Germany. The sites belong to two forest types, a mixed montane forest and a wet spruce forest. One gap in each forest type had been cleared after the storm event but not reafforested, the other had remained unchanged. Species richness was higher in gaps than in the undisturbed forest and higher in uncleared gaps than in cleared ones. It is suggested that the higher diversity in unmanaged gaps is mainly due to the formation of additional habitats (treefall pits and mounds) while most of the forest floor and its vegetation remains intact. The forest floor of cleared gaps is heavily disturbed which promotes the development of a dense cover of grass. This in turn suppresses most bryophyte species. An analysis of the life strategy spectra (sensu During) shows that in most microhabitats, in both the forest and windthrow areas, long-lived species (mostly perennials s. str.) predominate. For the gaps this is probably due to their age and the advanced colonization of open habitats. In contrast to this there is a clear dominance of the colonist strategy in the diaspore bank.

20149995|Experimental studies on water loss, absorption of water vapour, field water content and tolerance to desiccation and rehydration were undertaken in seven moss species growing in xeric and humid pine forests of Tenerife. The species that showed the highest drought tolerance were Hedwigia ciliata, Bartramia stricta, Grimmia laevigata and Grimmia trichophylla. The order of the species according to desiccation tolerance may be related to the aridity conditions of the habitat. Mosses with slow absorption of water vapour and great water loss resistance were those that showed the highest field water content (Polytrichum juniperinum, B. stricta and Anacolia webbii), although the values of field water content were low for all species (&lt140% of dry weight). These mosses were growing preferentially on soils. Species that showed fast rates of absorption of water vapour and of water loss, and the lowest field water content, were those growing on rocks (H. ciliata, G. laevigata, G. trichophylla and Pterogonium gracile).

20150004|Spores and fragments of Schistidium rivulare, Racomitrium aciculare, Dicranoweisia crispula, Oligotrichum hercynicum and Ceratodon purpureus were stored dry or in water for up to six months. Diaspores of all studied species survived for some time in water. Spores of S. rivulare showed a higher survival rate over time than spores of any of the other species, and the regeneration frequencies of fragments were highest in S. rivulare. For all species except S. rivulare, the germination frequencies of spores kept in water were significantly lower than of the spores kept dry at almost all time intervals. Hence, of the studied species, S. rivulare is thought to have the highest probability for surviving water transport, although water dispersal is not ruled out for any of the species. In general, the absolute regeneration frequencies of fragments were lower than the germination frequencies of spores. However, the fragments of all species generally survived as well in water as when stored dry, indicating a better tolerance towards water submergence for fragments than for spores.
20150196|The effects of simulated shade in terms of reduced light quantity (PPFD) and changed red:far-red ratio (R:FR ratio) on the growth in length, in number of branches and in biomass, were examined in a greenhouse experiment with Hylocomium splendens and Racomitrium lanuginosum, two species from habitats with different light conditions (with H. splendens often in more shaded microsites). Using ten intact moss turfs per species which had been collected on Iceland at 4 m distance between replicate turfs, we tested, whether light quantity affected growth and biomass, whether changes in light quantity and red:far-red ratio affected the number of branches, and whether the two species differed in these responses. Reduced light quantity (i.e. PPFD level) caused a greater length increase, decreased biomass, and biomass:length ratio in both species, but the magnitude of response varied greatly between species. Furthermore, in R. lanuginosum spectral shade (i.e. reduced PPFD and a lower R:FR ratio) generally caused stronger responses than neutral shade, with only a reduction in PPFD. H. splendens (from the shaded habitat) responded less strongly to the shade treatments than R. lanuginosum (from the open habitat) did. In addition to these effects of shading, there were strong effects of the turf of origin in both species, and in many cases the interaction between turf of origin and shading treatment was significant as well.

20149194|Under this heading the editor has compiled short notes of various contributors concerning new collections of rare or otherwise interesting bryophytes from Belgium (2 species) or The Netherlands (34 species). Below each contribution the initials of the contributor(s) are given; full names are given in the introduction. Most notes deal with new stations of rare species, and range extensions are reported for several less rare ones. Judging from the new data Diplophyllum obtusifolium, Anisothecium schreberianum, and Oxyrrhynchium pumilum might have been overlooked previously. New finds fortify the view that Dicranum tauricum is spreading in The Netherlands. A surprisingly large number of new collections is reported of Barbula hornschuchiana. The occurrence of Brachythecium plumosum in The Netherlands is proved by a first find of fruiting material (all previous collections that might belong there being sterile). Schistidium apocarpum has been found growing on a pollard-willow in a river foreland.

20149631| Soil samples taken in a range of habitats around Barcelona, including shrubland in a karstic area close to the sea, more continental gypsum sites, and montane Quercus pubescens and Fagus sylvatica forests, contained a varied diaspore bank of bryophytes. Particularly from the samples of the forest sites, considerable numbers of fern gametophytes emerged also. In all sites, the diaspore bank presumably consisted mostly of asexual propagules -- tubers, gemmae, leaf fragments, and in the case of hepatics and pleurocarpic mosses, decaying stem parts with some still viable cells. Ferns and annual/ephemeral bryophytes were probably present in the soil as spores. Irrespective of the above-ground bryophyte vegetation, species of the Colonist life strategy were dominant in the diaspore bank. Seasonal variation in the numbers of diaspores present was not observed, even though the sampling dates were just before and after the main period of spore release of some species that locally produced abundant sporophytes. Several species emerged from worm casts collected at the gypsum sites, some probably from spores, others from tubers. ///  ,       ,  ,       ,        Quercus pubescens  Fagus sylvatica,     .         ,    .             - , ,  ,       -         .   /         .     ,         .         ,                ,       .      ,    ,    ,    . 
20149304|The effects of management experiments in grassland and heath in the Eexterveld, NE-Drenthe, on the bryophyte vegetation were studied. The species composition before the beginning of the experiments (1972) has been compared with that of four years later (1976). Grazing (by sheep) changes the composition of the bryophyte vegetation strongly locally. In the heath liverworts disappear and acrocarps decrease. In the grassland pleurocarps show a tendency to disappear whereas many turf forming acrocarps have appeared. In mowed grassland the pleurocarps increase. Patches, from which formerly sods were cut, are still recognizable after 4 years by the high number of acrocarps in the heath as well as in the grassland. The composition does not change when the heath is left undisturbed or when fertilizers are added to the grassland.
20149203| A taxonomic revision is made of the genus Dawsonia, which is, following Smith, placed in the family of the Polytrichaceae. The two sections (Dawsonia and Superba) as amended by Smith are accepted. D. longiseta is placed in section Dawsonia. The section Superba has been divided in two species complexes, viz. the ecrenate complex (lamellae straight: D. superba, D. gigantea and D. grandis) and the crenate complex (lamellae crenate: D. beccarii, D. lativaginata, D. pullei and D. papuana). One new variety has been described: D. beccarii var. longivaginata Zant. & P. Heuk. The following new combinations are proposed: D. superba var. pulchra (Wijk) Zant., D. beccarii var. limbata (Dix.) Zant. & P. Heuk. The following new synonyms are proposed: D. intermedia (= D. superba var. pulchra), D. celebensis (= D. superba var. superba), D. crispifolia (= D. beccarii var. limbata), D. robbinsii (= D. beccarii var. limbata). D. papillata has been reduced to Pogonatum wallisii (C. Muell.) Jaeg. The diagnostic morphological characters are discussed. There are 9 species recognized, 2 of which are divided into varieties. An identification key is provided and for each taxon the following information is given: synonymy together with literature and typification, misidentifications, description, geographical distribution (usually with maps), ecology and notes. Each species is illustrated, and a list is given of the examined specimens. The phylogeny within the genus has been discussed and it has been argued that the genus originated in Antarctica-Australia. New Guinea is considered to be a secondary centre of evolution. Sect. Dawsonia is considered to be older than sect. Superba. A method has been worked out to detect which characters are primitive and which derived. The hygroscopic movements of the leaves are discussed. The "hinge-movement" is not caused by the swelling-tissue but by the peculiar structure of the lamellae at the hinge-joint and the quality of the cells of the nerve. The dispersal has been discussed. Long-range dispersal by air-currents is highly unlikely. Spore ejection is caused by raindrops or by other agencies which hit the mature capsules. ///     Dawsonia, ,  ,    Polytrichaceae:   (Dawsonia  Superba),  ,  . D. longiseta    Dawsonia.

20149191|Several interesting bryophytes were found on an artificial cascade constructed of pieces of limestone from the Belgian Ardennes in 1934.

The most interesting find was Plasteurhynchium striatulum, which was not recorded previously from The Netherlands.
20150153|The habitats of three wetland mosses in the genus Palustriella are evaluated based on numerous chemical parameters of their habitats in Sweden, the climate in Sweden and the European Alps, and their phylogenetic relationships. The phylogenetic analysis, where Cratoneuron was also included in the ingroup, suggests that P. falcata (Brid.) Hedens is the ancestral Palustriella species and that P. commutata (Hedw.) Ochyra and P. decipiens (De Not.) Ochyra evolved later. Palustriella falcata is found under a wide range of habitat conditions, in a relatively mild climate in very mineral-rich habitats or in habitats with more moderate mineral concentrations in a harsher climate. Palustriella commutata grows under very high mineral levels, relatively high nitrate levels (possibly a result of pollution rather than a habitat requirement), and in a relatively mild climate. Palustriella decipiens is found in harsh climates but can grow at relatively low mineral levels and is not restricted to strongly calcareous habitats. We hypothesise that the two latter species have kept or evolved further adaptations to parts of the realised niche of P. falcata. The differences in habitat preferences between the three species explain why P. commutata and P. decipiens have narrower geographical distribution ranges than P. falcata.

Twenty are new to the Amazonas of Ecuador, and eight are new to the country: Dolotortula mniifolia, Fissidens inaequalis, F. intermedius, F. intramarginatus, F. steerei, Pinnatella minuta, Pseudocryphaea flagellifera and Splachnobryum obtusum. Species richness at Aangu is similar to that recorded by others at Moraballi Creek, Guyana, and for west Suriname -- a low species richness compared to higher elevational zones in the Neotropics. For any given site of a few hectares in the neotropical wet lowland forests the number of mosses probably rarely exceeds 50 species and often is much lower. Comparison between the whole of Ecuadorean Amazonas and the Manaus region in Brazil shows similar species richness but significant differences in floristic composition at both generic and species level, possibly a reflection of historic vegetational differences between the upper and lower Amazonas region. /// ,            50  ,   20   33 .      ,      : Dolotortura mniifolia, Fissidens inaequalis, F. intermedius, F. intramarginatus, F. steerei, Pinnatella minuta, Pseudocryphaea flagellifera  Splachnobryum obtusum.       ,       ,     -             .                 50     .                ,            ,     , ,           .

20149240| During 1973 an investigation of the richly developed epiphytic bryophyte vegetation in the forest, Slotved Skov, 10 km E of Hjrring, Northern Jutland, Denmark was undertaken. The variation in distribution pattern on the two phorophyte species, Fraxinus excelsior and Fagus silvatica, was described by recordings from 600 systematically placed sample plots. Horizontal and vertical variations combined with variations due to inclination of the phorophytes were estimated by statistical methods. It was concluded that epiphytic bryophytes on Fraxinus grow most frequently at the trunk bases and on the 'upper' side of the trunks, but no preferences for any points of the compass were observed. On Fagus no distinctions of distribution frequencies could be made. Forest-floor vegetation was described and compared with the epiphytic flora on the trunk bases. A certain common element was recognized, Isothecium myurum, Plagiothecium succulentum, Brachythecium rutabulum, B. reflexum, Plagiomnium undulatum, Oxyrrhyncium swartzii, Lophocolea bidentata and Plagiochila asplenioides at Fraxinus, and Hypnum cupressiforme, Dicranum scoparium, Plagiothecium succulentum, Mnium hornum and Lophocolea heterophylla at Fagus. Diversity expressions were calculated in order to obtain a picture of the organizational patterns exhibited by the epiphytes. On Fraxinus, where the higher diversity values were obtained, total diversity decreased upwards along the trunks, while this trend was not followed on Fagus. Diversity was always low on much inclined trees, while on more perpendicular trees it might be either high or low. Association analyses were made in order to show the positive or negative association among epiphyte species and their relations to environmental factors. In this investigation only strictly objective statistical methods are applied, and no comparisons to the groupings set up by the Zrich-Montpellier school of phytosociology are attempted. ///   1973            , 10 .  ,  , .       , Fraxinus excelsior  Fagus silvatica,      600    .    ,      ,    . ,              ""  ,       -  .         .            .     --  : Isothecium myurum, Plagiothecium succulentum, Brachythecium rutabulum, B. reflexum, Plagiomnium undulatum, Oxyrrhynchium swartzii, Lophocolea bidentata  Plagiochila asplenioides -  : Hypnum cupressiforme, Dicranum scoparium, Plagiothecium succulentum, Mnium hornum  Lophocolea heterophylla.   ,       ,  .  ,       ,      ,          .       ,               .   ,                .         ,        ,    Zrich-Montpellier.

20150043|Petalophyllum ralfsii (Wils.) Nees & Gott. is the only species of the genus in Europe, and has an Oceanic-Mediterranean distribution. As a threatened (vulnerable) species in Europe, it is included in Appendix I of the Bern Convention and in Annex 2 of the EC Habitats and Species Directive. Although recorded for several European countries, many of these reports are old and the recent collections are mainly from the coast of the British Isles. In the Iberian Peninsula, it is known only from the south of Portugal (two localities in the Algarve) and from the Balearic Islands. The report from the Azores (Faial) is erroneous. Information on the Portuguese populations is given, as well as comments on the ecological requirements of this liverwort.

20150150|Forest floor bryophytes of the laurel forest of Gomera (Canary Islands) were studied to detect patterns of variation in species composition and life strategies of the bryophyte communities among stands of different trees. Environmental variables that best predict richness, cover and bryophyte composition were assessed. Twenty six moss and 21 liverwort species were found in 59 sample plots and 201 sub-plots. Seven types of forests were distinguished by TWIN-SPAN according to tree composition, but only the three types "broad-leaved forests", "old ericaceous forest" and "second-growth ericaceous forest" had an associated bryophyte community. The main differences between these three types may be related to structure (total basal area and canopy height), tree composition (ericaceous/broad-leaved) and microclimate (related to mist precipitation and throughfall). The perennial stayer life strategy had the highest number of species and cover in all three forest types; however, the perennial competitive sub-category was only abundant in the second-growth ericaceous forest. The long-lived shuttle life strategy was dominant in old ericaceous forest. The presence of colonist species sensu stricto seems related to fine-scaled disturbances in the forest floor of the broad-leaved forest and also with drought stress in small patches of the ericaceous forests. Short-lived shuttle species were very scarce in the study area. Patterns in species richness, cover and life strategy distribution suggest that light intensity, mist precipitation and disturbance are the most important factors for forest floor bryophytes in Garajonay National Park.
20111722| A taxonomic revision is made of the species of Thuidium, Pelekium, and Rauiella in Africa south of the Sahara. Brotherus's classification of the genera and their subdivisions has been accepted without change, but some critical remarks and suggestions for a future classification are made. 14 species of African Thuidium are recognised, 24 reductions are made within this genus, and 2 new combinations are proposed: T. gratum (P. Beauv.) Jaeg. ssp. subscissum (Besch.) Touw (T. subscissum Besch.) and T. involvens (Hedw.) Mitt. ssp. thomeanum (Broth.) Touw (T. involvens var. thomeanum Broth.). T. fuciforme (Brid.)

20149868| Persistence, the tendency of a species to remain in its original position and not to colonize new sites, is studied for 36 bryophyte species in spruce forest and 20 species (including 7 lichens) in pine forest in S Norway. Data sets include presence/absence in 199 meso plots (1 m) with 3184 subplots (1/16 m), analyzed with a 5-yr interval, and a subset with 50 meso plots and 800 subplots, analyzed for six consecutive years. Persistence was calculated for different temporal (1-5 yr) and spatial (1/16 and 1 m) scales. Patterns in the spruce and pine forests were closely similar, and two main components of variation in persistence were demonstrated by PCA analyses: (1) the absolute level of persistence which is strongly associated with size and runs from small bryophytes (mostly hepatics) to large mosses, hepatics, Sphagnum and lichens, and (2) variation related to spatial scale. No variation in persistence could be attributed to main local environmental complex-gradients, but variation in absolute persistence coincided with a micro-scale coenocline. Persistence is discussed in relation to real and apparent disappearances and colonizations. Strong size-dependence of persistence is suggested a typical property of cryptogams, on the levels of species as well as individual shoots. The results add to previous evidence suggesting low importance of interspecific competition in the boreal coniferous forest floor. /// ,            ,    36       20  ( 7 )      .    /  199   (1 )  3184  (1/16 ),    5 ,    50    800 ,   6  .

27809533|Sphagnum venustum Flatberg (Bryophyta, sect. Acutifolia) is described as a new species from Labrador, Canada. The new species is foremost characterized by its tender and soft plants with a varying element of pale brown colour in branches and stems, long divergent branches with slender, whitish distal ends, a weak stem, loose stem leaves that are predominantly lingulatetriangular in shape with subacute apices, but which often have a varying degree of eroded and resorbed cells in their distal part and apices, short branch leaves compared to the stem leaves, few hyalocyst pores on the convex surface of the divergent branch leaves, retort cells of the branch cortex with distinct neck, and by the often broad shape of the chlorophyllose cells of the branch leaves as viewed in transverse section. The species is also characterized by the wide intra- and interplant variation found in morphological attributes. The new species has so far been found in four mire localities in the northern boreal zone of southern Labrador. According to current knowledge it is endemic for this region, but more localities are likely to be discovered. It is found in poor fens, with a preference for lawn and carpet communities in both soligenous and topogenous sites, and with more occasional occurrences in hummock habitats. It is the only known brown-coloured boreal species in sect. Acutifolia that shows a preference for poor fen lawn and carpet communities. Sporophytes and antheridial branches have been found once, and the species is most likely dioicous. The relationship of S. venustum to other Acutifolia species is difficult to evaluate from morphological criteria, and it displays morphological traits that point to possible evolutionary lines to several other boreal species in the section.

20149913| The circumscription of Brachythecium erythrorrhizon B., S. G. (B. thedenii B. S. & G.) in the literature has varied somewhat. Based on studies of Swedish material and of type material, it is concluded that this species is closely related to B. salebrosum (Web. & Mohr) B., S. & G., which it resembles except in the following characters. It is smaller [dry shoots (0.6-)0.7-1.2 vs 1.1-1.8(-1.9) mm wide], has more strongly falcate and more strongly plicate stem and branch leaves, has smaller median lamina cells in the stem leaves [(27.0-)29.5-94.5  6.5-8.5(-10.0) vs 54.0-149.0  (7.5-)8.0-10.5 m], and is dioicous (B. salebrosum is autoicous). In Sweden, Brachythecium erythrorrhizon is mainly a lowland species, and it is often found in more or less mineral-rich habitats.

20149735|The hepatic Metzgeria fruticulosa (Dicks.) Evans occurs in southwestern Sweden, Denmark and southern Norway in Fennoscandia. The species is most frequent in localities with a high relative air humidity, and shows a preference for trunks of living trees of relatively small diameter with smooth bark and a bark pH of 5.4-7.0. The most common phorophyte is Fagus sylvatica L., but the hepatic also occurs on other tree species, especially Acer platanoides L., and is often associated with Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. and Ulota crispa (Hedw.) Brid. M. fruticulosa seems to be competitively inferior to other epiphytes found in its habitat. The ecology of the species differs slightly in different parts of Europe.
20149912|The composition and structure of bryophyte and fern diaspore banks were studied in three agricultural fields situated at two different localities in the vicinity of Bern, Switzerland. Soil cores were taken in profiles at depths between 1.5 and 50 cm at three positions in each field. Fifteen bryophyte species and a considerable number of fern gametophytes representing at least two taxa emerged from these soil samples cultivated during seven months. The number of fern prothallia did not differ significantly between the two localities at different distances from sporophytic fern populations. Significantly fewer prothallia and fewer hornwort sporelings appeared, and protonemata of mosses showed a tendency to grow less vigorously, in soil samples from below 25 cm compared with those above. Agricultural management (regular ploughing at 20 to 25 cm) is considered to be mainly responsible for this overall vertical distribution pattern. Both the complement of Srensen's Index and Canonical Correspondence Analysis show that the bryophyte species composition of the diaspore bank varies more between than within fields and most strongly between fields from different localities. Within fields, the floristic composition tends to vary more with depth than between profiles. Dicranella staphylina, D. schreberiana, Bryum rubens and one to two Pottiaceae (Pottia sp., Phascum sp.) were common in the diaspore banks of all fields; a few species were present below-ground but not on the surface of the particular field; and diaspores of Eurhynchium hians and Riccia sp. did not occur at depths greater than 15 cm.

20149711| Potassium orthophosphate solution (5 mol m) was sprayed onto pure swards of Pseudoscleropodium purum in Windsor Forest, UK, to study uptake and retention of K and P by the moss carpet. Before, and at intervals following eight successive daily applications of KHPO, the concentrations of P (intracellular) and K (intercellular, exchangeable, intracellular) were assayed in apical (0-2 cm) and subapical (2-4 cm) tissues. Throughfall of these elements from the moss and litter layer was determined using collectors placed beneath the sward. Appreciable net uptake of K and P occurred in apical and subapical segments of P. purum. Intracellular levels of both elements were highest in the apex and greatest net uptake also occurred here. Levels of the added nutrients fell progressively on cessation of the nutrient applications, although for P the concentration in treated plants remained significantly above the controls after 74 d. No evidence was obtained for a net transfer of nutrients from apex to subapex so that the decline probably represents true loss rather than internal redistribution of elements. Only 6.3% of the added P and 12.1% of added K were recovered in moss throughfall after 74 d although levels in the living moss had fallen to 31% and 23%, respectively, of the maxima recorded after nutrient application. It is suggested that the missing fraction had been sequestered by microorganisms or remained uneluted in the litter. Although P. purum appears to have a low capacity to directly utilise nutrients received in wet deposition, the elements in the litter/microorganisms might eventually re-enter the living moss by mass flow. ///    (5 mol M)       Pseudoscleropdium purum   , ,           .

20150208|A detailed investigation of spore release and dispersal from an isolated colony of Phascum cuspidatum Hedw. indicated that approximately 98% of the spores originally present remained within the colony. The spatial distribution of colonies of P. cuspidatum and Pottia truncata (Hedw.) Frnr. in relation to those of the previous year was investigated by mapping the occurrence of colonies in five permanent quadrats for each species during two successive years. Phascum cuspidatum reoccurred in three quadrats during the second year, and P. truncata in only one, in the latter case apparently due to invasion by other mosses, principally Barbula hornschuchiana Schultz. A substantial proportion of the second year colonies overlapped in position with the first year colonies, particularly in P. cuspidatum. The results are discussed in relation to data on spore dispersal and other aspects of the life-history of these annual or short-lived shuttle mosses.

20149686|Preissia quadrata was found in a floating fen in "The Weerribben", a nature reserve in North-Western Overijssel, The Netherlands. In this century, P. quadrata has not been found in this habitat in The Netherlands. The species composition of the bryophyte layer of this floating fen resembles rich fen bryophyte vegetation of known Preissia habitats like calcareous dune slacks or upland calcareous marshes. Yet, the occurrence of P. quadrata is significant, since it has not been discovered during 15 yr of extensive survey of this habitat type and since this fen is one of very few left with a characteristic floating fen bryophyte flora in optima forma.

lindbergia.35.53|Due to their high shoot density and ability to store and transport water externally, ectohydric bryophytes may share water laterally among shoots. Given that rates of evaporation may be spatially variable across the canopy due to structural irregularities that cause surface roughness, lateral water transport via integrated capillary networks may affect shoot water status and influence carbon dynamics. The interaction between capillary integration and surface roughness was explored using simulation modeling. A shoot-level model of water and carbon dynamics and their interaction was developed to model acrocarpous or

The populations in South Greenland form a natural and coherent northeastern extension of the species' range in eastern North America, where D. falcatum is relatively rare; eastward, Greenland populations are isolated from the Eurasian range which is continental and boreal. One northern population is disjunct from other populations in Greenland and in Canada; it allies D. falcatum to the group of species already known to suggest the presence of a late Pleistocene refugium in parts of central West and Northwest Greenland. Sporophytes were present only in one Greenland population which is in the southern part of the island. /// Dichelyna falcatum    ,         .         -          ,  D. falcatum  ;          ,     .           ;   D. falcatum     ,             - .       ,     .

Based upon spore morphology, and other gametophytic and sporophytic characterstates, E. spathulata belongs to the group of taxa comprising the E. rhaptocarpa Schwaegr.-E. vulgaris Hedw. complex. It is often a difficult taxon to distinguish; critical differentiating features of calyptrae and capsules are variable. However, the small size of the plants, narrow leaves with hair-points, dark red setae, gymnostomous, delicately striate capsules, and pale calyptrae with a short, narrow rostrum and ill-defined fringe are diagnostic.

20149205| The Sphagnum flora of the hot springs in Iceland is mostly associated with alcaline waters and is here often much more richly developed than in other parts of Iceland. Dominant species are S. teres, S. papillosum, S. subnitens, and S. palustre. Of these, only S. teres is dominant in the Sphagnum flora of Iceland as a whole, while S. palustre is exclusive to the springs. Several species associated with the springs can be considered members of an oceanic element. The flora of the individual springs varies, probably due to differences in chemical composition of the water but, overall, the spring flora differs radically from that elsewhere in Iceland. The most characteristic species are also those which grow closest to the very hot water. Water temperatures of up to 42C have been measured in Sphagnum tussocks. ///            ,       ,     .

20149849| Direct and indirect effects of eutrophication on the replacement of the rich-fen bryophyte species Scorpidium scorpioides by Calliergonella cuspidata were studied by cultivation experiments in mono and mixed culture under different nutrient, light and litter conditions. Rates of CO-uptake were measured at different light intensities. Growth in length was stimulated by phosphorus supply in S. scorpioides, whereas C. cuspidata was not affected by N, P or NP. Both species showed reduced growth in mixed culture. Scorpidium scorpioides appeared to be more shade-tolerant and showed increased growth in length in shaded treatments, whereas C. cuspidata was negatively affected by low light conditions. Supply of litter, resulting in increased nutrient availability and, via litter as a "climbing frame", a drier environment, had minor effects on S. scorpioides, but C. cuspidata responded with a strong increase in dry weight. The latter species grew even better in mixed culture. The replacement of S. scorpioides by C. cuspidata is probably not regulated by decreased light availability. Calliergonella cuspidata seems unable to use increased nutrient levels under wet conditions. In a drier environment, possibly reached via a "climbing frame", C. cuspidata may make better used of an increased nutrient availability and outcompete S. scorpioides, but this should be further tested. ///           Scorpidium scorpioides  Calliergonella cuspidata              ,   .

20150210|Bryophytes have several special features, such as haploid gametophytes and the ability to disperse over long distances, which suggest a different spatial partition of neutral genetic variation than in vascular plants. There are, however, only a few nuclear markers for reconstructing infraspecific phylogenies in bryophytes. We designed primers spanning the 2-9 exons and intervening introns of the GapC gene (2550 bp). Our primers were designed to selectively amplify sequences of the genus Sphagnum; however, their degeneracy makes it possible to obtain sequences from other groups of bryophytes. In a pilot study, well-resolved infraspecific phylogenies have been obtained using 10 European Sphagnum fimbriatum Wils. accessions.

20149945|Sphagnum has been studied on Gotland, a 3000 km large island, and one of the most strongly calcareous areas in Sweden. The few habitats suitable for peat mosses are scattered over the whole island, and have resulted in a lot of small and very local occurrences, together totalling only 0.03 km. The growth rate of individual Sphagnum patches has been studied; preliminary results point to a mean growth per occurrence of 3.6 cm radial growth per year, with the two robust species S. palustre and S. squarrosum showing the highest growth rates. The average growth rate corresponds to 15 years to build up 1 m of Sphagnum. Nearly 80% of the Sphagnum occurrences are very small (up to 3 m), suggesting a drastic increase of Sphagnum on Gotland in the last decades. pH (measured directly in Sphagnum) varied between 3.2 and 6.9 and is thus similar to values found for most species in the USA. Three quarters of the Sphagnum localities are found on Forest soils (Eutric Cambisols and Haplic Podzols). These soils, with an acid reaction, cover only a third of Gotland's area. The 250 species of vascular plants, found growing directly in peat mosses, reflect the flora of the surroundings, with some exceptions (e.g. hardly any annual and biennial species).
20149664| The bryophyte flora of Gros Morne National Park consists of 417 species (325 mosses, 92 hepatics). This floristic richness is a reflection of habitat diversity and glacial history. Five regions (based on combinations of geology and physiography) are recognized within the park: Coastal Plain, Acidic Highlands, Mafic Highlands, Ultramafic Highlands, and Calcareous Highlands. The Acidic Highlands have the most diverse flora, although the Calcareous Highlands have almost as many species. The Ultramafic Highlands have the fewest species. Ecological factors, including competition and habitat, may determine the presence of rare otherwise phytogeographically significant bryophytes in the park and, although these factors are considered of importance, they are shown to apply to most bryophytes, whether rare or not. Historical factors help the interpretation of the origin of the Gros Morne flora. The park has a large complement of bryophytes whose distributions suggest that they are glacial relics and survived the Wisconsin Glaciation in or near the sites where they are found today. Several late-Pleistocene ice-free areas occur within what is now the park. These could have served as refugia for bryophytes that now show disjunct distributions and isolated populations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence region. ///       (Gros Morne)   417  (325 , 92 ).          .

20149309|Campylium protensum is closely related to C. stellatum with which it is often confused. It is separated from C. stellatum by its smaller, usually strongly squarrose leaves, dense branching and prostate growth. Its autecology differs strongly from that of C. stellatum and it is found in a broad range of habitats. C. protensum is widely distributed in Norway.
20150242|This study examined the short-term growth responses to a temperature increase in situ of three bryophytes species of different genera. Temperatures were enhanced by the use of open-top chambers at Latnjajaure, a subarctic-alpine site in northernmost Sweden. Growth was measured during the growing season of 1995, using the tied-thread method for Aulacomnium turgidum, the cranked-wire method for Sphagnum teres, and the short-transplanting method for Tomentypnum nitens. Temperature enhancement significantly increased the growth in length of Sphagnum teres while no significant effects were found for the other two species. One possible reason for this is that Sphagnum teres had more water available, while the other two species could not respond to increased temperature due to constraints of water availability.

20149974|Gametophore fragments from two populations of each of the closely related Sphagnum fallax and S. isoviitae were regenerated on agar in axenic culture. Fragments from stem branches and capitulum branches were grown in media with or without additions of glucose and cytokinin in order to find conditions for rapid production of a large number of clonal gametophores. The morphology of the regenerated material was compared with the field collected gametophores. After 5 weeks 62% of the cultures had regenerated. The frequency of fragments regenerating was considerably higher from capitulum branch fragments than stem branch fragments, while cytokinin seemed to hamper both initiation of regeneration and growth of the regenerated material. Addition of glucose caused extensive losses of cultures due to contamination. The regenerated material was distinctly different morphologically from the field collected gametophores in having larger branch leaves and large hemi-isophyllous stem leaves. Gametophores initiated from stem branch fragments had larger stem leaves than those initiated from capitulum branches. Morphological characters varied considerably between cultures of the same genotype, but much less within clonal cultures suggesting that cultures are in different stages of development. The experiment shows that regeneration on agar in axenic culture is an adequate method for fast propagation of clonal material for a diversity of purposes, and suggests ways of optimising this approach.
20149893|Fossil mosses from the late-glacial sediments at Krkenes have been analysed stratigraphically and semi-quantitatively. Most are identified to species level. The representation of terrestrial moss floras in lake sediments and diagenetic processes that hinder fossil moss identification are discussed. Detrended correspondence analysis of the 45 samples and 71 taxa at Krkenes was interpreted with the help of Ellenberg ecological indicator values for temperature, pH, moisture, continentality, and light. The main variation in the data set reflects the species' temperature demands, and follows the major temperature changes in the late-glacial. Comparison with the present-day altitudinal distributions of the species found fossil yields estimates of the late-glacial climate. The modern ecology, the DCA results, and the indicator values are used to reconstruct the range of late-glacial habitats and changes in the moss vegetation. The Allerd was cool and treeless and moss habitats were mainly influenced by snow and frost. The Younger Dryas was colder, a cirque glacier developed in the catchment, and substrata were predominantly unstable and wet. Temperature rose quickly at the opening of the Holocene. Stabilising soils and habitats were dominated by tall ferns and Salix scrub. Birch woodland subsequently developed, with mosses characteristic of open birch-woodlands today in western Norway. This study shows that mosses colonise newly available habitats as rapidly as vascular plants, that fossil mosses provide evidence for microhabitats unobtainable from vascular-plant fossils, and that fossil mosses have made a unique contribution to the reconstruction of the late-glacial and early Holocene vegetation and environment at Krkenes.
20150030|On the basis of geological and archaeological finds the Holocene distribution of Neckera crispa Hedw. in the Netherlands is reconstructed. This moss occurred here 100 000 year ago (Eemian) and later again from the Neolithic (ca 6000 years ago) until recent times. The prehistoric and historic finds suggest that it was more or less common as an epiphyte on deciduous trees in moist forests. The disappearance of this habitat during the past centuries was probably the reason for the decline and disappearence of Neckera crispa. Prehistoric and historic man has used this moss for different purposes, among others the caulking of ships.
20149613| The present checklist is a revision of the first checklist of the mosses of Canada published in 1980. The list is based on verified herbarium specimens and literature reports. The mosses are reported for each of the 10 provinces and two territories, with Labrador and the Arctic Archipelago listed separately. A total of 965 species, 6 subspecies, 101 varieties, and 5 forms in 223 genera and 53 families are recognized for Canada. ///         ,   1980 .          .        ,      .     965 , 6 , 101   5   223   53 .

20149763| The genus Pseudocalliergon (Limpr.) Loeske is revised for northern Europe. The genus is interpreted as consisting of P. angustifolium Hedens, sp. nov., P. lycopodioides (Brid.) Hedens, comb. nov., P. brevifolium (Lindb.) Hedens, comb. nov., P. turgescens (T. Jens.) Loeske and P. trifarium (Web. & Mohr) Loeske. The genus is defined by, i.a., the typical colour and gloss of the species, the structure of the alar cell group, the structure and colour of the axillary hairs and the ecology of the species. All the species grow in lime-rich and, except for P. trifarium, small and often shallow and periodically dry wetland habitats (sometimes the habitats are flushed with lime-rich water). In northern Europe, P. angustifolium grows in the Scandinavian mountain range and in the more eastern areas also in the Northern Boreal zone. P. lycopodioides reaches north to Iceland and S Norway in the west and approximately to the Middle Boreal zone in the east. P. brevifolium occurs only in the arctic areas. P. turgescens is found in the Scandinavian mountain range, north-eastwards to north-westernmost Finland and to Troms in Norway, and occurs also in (probably) relict localities around the Baltic Sea.

20149505| Timmia Hedw. sect. Timmia is revised on a worldwide scale. The section consists of a single species, T. megapolitana Hedw., with two subspecies. Subsp. megapolitana is distinguished primarily by larger lamina cells and papillae on the dorsal surface of the leaf sheath; subsp. bavarica (Hessl.) Brassard, comb. et stat. nov., has smaller lamina cells, and the leaf sheaths are generally non-papillose. Intermediate populations with small lamina cells and papillose sheaths are assigned to subsp. bavarica.

20149752| The concentrations of mineral element in three species of Sphagnum (S. fallax, S. magellanicum and S. capillifolium) as well as in bog-pool water were determined at periodic intervals during the 1989 growing season. Potassium, calcium and heavy metals account for most of the interspecific variation, K being more concentrated in hollow species, Ca as well as heavy metals in hummock species. The concentrations of other elements show a seasonal pattern of variation largely common to all species and therefore reflecting general processes. Sodium, magnesium, and to a certain degree calcium become progressively more concentrated in Sphagnum tissues during the growing season and are leached from cell walls prevalently during the cold months. Nitrogen and to a lesser extent phosphorus are enriched in the chlorophyllose cells during the period of intense growth and are leaked from the cell interior as soon as growth rate becomes slower. Leaching of nutrients is probably determined by an increased permeability of plasmalemma determined by senescence. ///         (S. fallax, S. magellanicum  S. caprillifolium),                 1989 . ,          ,      ,         ,   .       ,       , ,   . , ,                          .                          .        ,  .

20149901| Five species of Rhynchostegiella (Brachytheciaceae) occur in the Canary Islands (Spain): R. trichophylla, R. teneriffae, R. macilenta, R. bourgeana, and R. litorea. Keys and illustrations are provided for the species and their taxonomy is discussed. R. trichophylla is a new species, characterized by: 1 a subulate leaf apex formed by the longly excurrent nerve; 2 median lamina cells 30-60 m long; 3 absence of a central strand; and 4 a smooth seta. R. jacquinii and R. teesdalei are shown to be conspecific and both reduced to synonymy under R. teneriffae. R. bourgeana is accepted as a distinct species, characterized by: 1 ovate-lanceolate concave leaves; 2 a thin nerve which disappears in the upper half of the leaf; 3 median lamina cells 60-90 m long; and 4 quadrate-rectangular alar cells, which form a distinct group. R. litorea and R. tenella can be separated as follows: 1 nerve 1/2-2/3 of length of leaf, spores 14-22 m, seta more or less rough (R. litorea); 2 nerve ending in acumen or shortly excurrent, spores 10-15 m, seta usually smooth (R. tenella).

20150056|The geographical distributions, in the form of mosaic maps, altitudinal ranges, frequencies, and habitats of 29 Sphagnum taxa known to occur in Switzerland are described. The detailed distribution patterns vary among individual taxa depending on their habitat requirements. Sphagnum fimbriatum is confined to lowlands in the north and north-west of the country. Similarly, S. cuspidatum, S. rubellum, S. squarrosum, and S. tenellum are more common north than south of the Alps while the occurrences of S. platyphyllum show a southern tendency. S. capillifolium and S. magellanicum are the most frequent taxa, followed by S. compactum, S. russowii, and S. subsecundum whereas S. molle, S. subfulvum, and S. affine are known from four or fewer localities. Taxa with a narrow vertical range are in general ecologically more restricted than taxa which are widely distributed with respect to altitude. Peat mosses do not occur in the northern, north-western, and southernmost lowlands, nor in the Central Alps due to climatic reasons, and have disappeared from the Plateau mainly because of wetland drainage and fertilization in the course of increasing agricultural intensity. Most Sphagna have probably declined as a consequence of habitat loss and/or degradation, and from a national viewpoint, many taxa are nowadays considered to be threatened in Switzerland.

20149976|Facilitation of later-arriving species by early colonists is one of several mechanisms that together drive the directional changes in species composition observed in primary succession. However, the other 'half' of this interaction -- the effect of the facilitated species on its benefactor -- is often unclear. If this effect is inhibitory, then the overall interaction is contramensalism (+, -). An example of a contramensal interaction is given. This involves the overgrowth of a complex taxonomic assemblage of several 'pioneer' bryophyte species by the liverwort Conocephalum conicum. The former facilitates the latter, as judged by a very highly significant enhancement of C. conicum's growth rate; while C. conicum inhibits (indeed kills) the overgrown pioneer assemblage. The mechanism underlying the facilitatory component of this interaction is not yet clear, but may involve elevation of microclimatic humidity. In contrast, the mechanism of inhibition is readily apparent: tissue death due to virtually complete blockage of light penetration. The directness of the link between small-scale localized interspecific interactions (such as this) and broad-scale community successional change depends on many factors, including the degree of physical disturbance.
20149561|Frullania fragilifolia (Tayl.) Gott., Lindenb. & Nees has been found for the first time in the Netherlands, in the former freshwater tidal area of the Biesbosch, prov. of Noord-Brabant. It was growing on Salix in a no longer used coppice wood. Several other epiphytes which have become rare nowadays, i.a. Ulota coarctata, Cryphaea heteromalla and Neckera complanata, have been found there.

20149871| Bryophyte subfossils from the Perpohjola and Trend interstadials (c. 105,000-93,000 and 85,000-75,000 years B.P.) in northernmost Sweden serve as paleoenvironmental indicators. Approximately 100 taxa were found in 97 samples from 17 localities. The samples were analysed by Twinspan and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) to detect vegetation types and other patterns. Separate analyses of wetland taxa and taxa of drier habitats yielded different Twinspan divisions of the samples and different distribution patterns of the samples along the DCA axes. In both ecological groups there was a prevalence of taxa that are either indifferent to mineral richness or that grow in rather mineral-rich habitats. For the taxa of drier habitats, the moisture gradient and the gradient between more and less stable substrates seem to be important in explaining the observed patterns of species associations. For the wetland species, wetness and nutrient richness (N, P) of the habitat seem to be the most important factors. The deposition environment (classified as kettle holes, Veiki moraines or other environments) seems to have influenced the species composition of drier habitats more than the wetlands. This may reflect that the deposition of the material from the drier habitats is allochtonous and influenced by more environmental factors than the autochtonous deposition of the wetland taxa. The samples of taxa from drier habitats indicate a somewhat more closed bryophyte vegetation during parts of the Perpohjola than during the sampled part of the Trend interstadial. In the wetland samples, species of very wet (often submerged) habitats occurred more often in samples from the southern than from the northern part of the study area, which may reflect either climatic differences or differences in topography or water permeability of the ground at the time of deposition. Several species that are presently arctic or mountainous in northern Europe were found, indicating a colder climate than today and an open environment with few or no large shrubs and trees. Campylopus schimperi Milde and Loeskypnum wickesii (Grout) Tuom., indicate that the climate was comparatively oceanic during at least parts of the interstadial periods, whereas the occurrences of Hamatocaulis vernicosus (Mitt.) Hedens and Helodium blandowii (Web. & Mohr) Warnst. may indicate the opposite. ///         (. 105,000 - 93,000  85,000 - 75,000   )       .  1000     97   17 .

20149963|The new IUCN threat categories include many numerical thresholds that require quantitative data. Since such data are rare for bryophytes, the evaluation against the threat categories must often be done by inference from the available data. The most relevant data that can be used for bryophytes are population decline, present distribution and total population size, number of sites, and estimated loss of relevant habitats over the last 10 years or three generations. For assessing species at a regional level, evidence of an inflow of propagules from outside the Red List region is discussed. The use of the terms 'individual', 'fragmentation', 'location' and 'generation time' is also discussed.
20150143|We present a protocol for the use of inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) in bryophytes. The method was developed recently and is now being used on bryophytes. ISSR is a PCR-based method and includes the amplification of DNA fragments by relatively short primers (ca 10-30 bp), which attach to the template simple sequence repeats (SSR) regions. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed and the method is compared with other molecular methods used in bryophyte population genetics including isozymes, RAPD, AFLP and RFLP. We further discuss how to optimize the PCR and the repeatability of ISSR.
20149626| Seasonal dynamics of net photosynthetic activity, growth and chlorophyll content of the peat moss Sphagnum papillosum Lindb. has been studied in a raised bog near Ljubljana (Slovenia, Yugoslavia). Generally, no correlations were recorded between the annual course of net photosynthesis and the growth dynamics. Maximum values of net photosynthesis were achieved in August (1.95 mg CO g h), when the rate of biomass accumulation decreased. At the beginning of the growing season, growth in dry weight was intensive. During the winter months photosynthetic activity declined and in February it was completely interrupted. Chlorophyll content varied markedly during the sampling period. Chlorophyll content was positively correlated with net photosynthesis, but not with growth. In 1984, 3.3 cm growth in length and 20 mg plant increase in dry weight were recorded. ///      (, )       ,       Sphagnum papillosum.         ,  ,   .

20149897| Overall establishment rate from the 'diaspore' bank and growth rate of bryophytes on a Swedish Ordovician limestone soil were greatly favoured by application of soluble CaHPO, 10 mol g dry weight, in a greenhouse experiment conducted during 12 months, Total biomass produced was ca 7 times greater in the phosphate treated soil than in the untreated soil. Particularly favoured by phosphate were Barbula convoluta, B. hornschuchiana, Bryum argenteum, Entosthodon fasciculare and Preissia quadrata. Of the ca 25 taxa recorded the only ones which seemed disfavoured by the phosphate treatement were Trichostomum brachydontium, Tr. crispulum and Tortella tortuosa.

A key and illustrations are given, based on Malta (1926) and on personal observations.
20149762| All observed capsules of Bryowijkia ambigua (Hook.) Noguchi, contain small unicellular spores (38-58 m) that are aborted, and large multicellular spores (145-180 m) that are presumably viable. Regardless of maturation stage of a capsule or geographical origin, spore size variation within a capsule follows a consistent bimodal pattern. The two types of spores are in a constant 1:1 ratio, with about 230-250 spores of each type per capsule. This ratio is established early in spore development, after a phase of granule deposition. In each tetrad, two spores abort while still unicellular and the other two spores remain viable and become multicellular. These observations suggest that the spore mass in Bryowijkia ambigua represents a very unusual instance of false anisospory, since it involves unicellular and multicellular spores. As a phylogenetic trait, these multicellular spores are interpreted as a derived feature, as compared with the unicellular spores in Trachypus, other genera in the Trachypodaceae, and the majority of species in mosses. ///    Bryowijkia ambiqua (Hook.)

20149698| Enzyme electrophoresis was used to estimate genetic variation in R. strumiferum, R. tomentosum, R. intermedium and R. capense. Eight enzyme systems, representing 10 loci, were used. Three loci showed double bands in the monoicous R. tomentosum, while the other, dioicous, species produced only single bands for these loci. Chromosome counts showed that the double banding pattern in R. tomentosum coincided with a double number of chromosomes (n = 20, versus n = 10 in R. strumiferum and R. capense). The finding of both heterozygotes and homozygotes for Pgm-2 and Got suggests that autodiploidy is the most likely origin of R. tomentosum. The mean gene diversity within populations of the four Racopilum species ranged from 0.06-0.21, which is a moderate to high level of genetic variation compared with phanerogams. Between populations of different species the genetic distances were generally much larger than between populations within each species. In view of its very distinct sporophyte, R. intermedium might be ranked as a separate genus. The electrophoretic data, however, do not support this view and show a close genetic relationship with R. tomentosum and R. capense.

20149305|Notes on the distribution, ecology and variability of the species of Andreaea, Archidium, Ditrichum and Ceratodon in the Netherlands, following a revision of the herbarium collections. Ditrichum lineare appeared to be more widespread as was formerly understood. It often grows as scattered small sterile shoots among other species of Ditrichum and is restricted to loamy soils. Numerous new localities of Ditrichum cylindricum, which was only recently discovered, show that it is frequent in parts of our country where loamy or rich sandy soils prevail. The average size of Ditrichum flexicaule-plants collected in the last century is almost twice as large as those of plants collected from 1900 onwards. Growing conditions for this species apparently are no longer favourable. Ceratodon purpureus var. conicus has been erronously recorded. The only characteristic feature of the type material is the long excurrent nerve; the broad leaves and the erect capsules are also regularly present with forms of var. purpureus. Other renowned characteristics of var. conicus are absent from the type material. Starved forms of C. purpureus often bear bundles of gemmiferous threads in the leaf axils; this way of vegetative propagation may be important for its local distribution.
20149837| The occurrence of nematode galls is reported on an Indian liverwort Cheilolejeunea cf. giraldiana (Mass.) Mizut. Interestingly, the presence of the nematode induces some morphological changes in the leaves which form the gall at the shoot apex.

Gall-forming leaves are not differentiated into lobes and lobules and the margin is either smooth or with 1-3 (5)-celled projections in the outer whorl and inner whorl, respectively. ///        Cheilolejeunea cp.giraldiana (Mass.)

20150205|Bryophyte community ecology has played a central role in developing our understanding of how bryophyte species are arranged within plant communities, however it has largely been descriptive in nature. Other aspects of bryophyte communities that deserve our attention are more dynamic, and include the origin, assembly, change, and probable future of bryophyte guilds. In this essay, I review five topics that illustrate important advances in our understanding of complex species patterns. 1) Changes in the occurrence and extent of communities in response to climatic change; 2) sources of diaspores for bryophyte community establishment; 3) persistence of bryophyte assemblages; 4) importance of habitats to species occurrence and the coarse filter approach; and 5) quantification of bryophyte niches. All of the papers reviewed here use aspects of community ecology to help resolve broad scale questions by going beyond just description. These papers represent the beginnings of the next generation of community ecology and seek answers to why patterns occur and how these patterns relate to both population and ecosystem processes.

20149731| Yearly growth between 1987-90 of Racomitrium microcarpon (Hedw.) Brid. growing on exposed, dry, granite rock ledges in northwestern Ontario, Canada is estimated to range between 2.3 and 3.1 mm yr. Significant variation in yearly growth could not be demonstrated within colonies. Growth differences between colonies were significant. Growth during 1989-90 was highly significantly different than that from the previous two years. These yearly growth differences appear to be related to relatively high precipitation during the four month growing season, resulting in less aridity and to increased local runoff from high rainfall events. Relative humidity and temperature are less important. Mean age of the colonies is 35 yr, however the current colonies are secondary, arising from earlier colonization events of 70-75 yr ago in a forest about 110 yr in age. /// ,     1987-1990.

In addition, the verrucate type of spore ornamentation occurs in two species, H. cylindricarpa and H. striatella, where it is more common than the gemmate type. The close similarity in the ornamentation of the spores of these two species may indicate that they are more closely related to one another than to the other species.

20149342|The dutch herbarium specimens of Dicranum Hedw. sect. Dicranum have been revised. A short diagnosis of the section and a key to its species and varieties is given. Notes are given on the distribution, ecology and variability of the taxa. For nearly all taxa a decline in frequency, fertility and vitality is reported. The mean stem length of specimens collected in the 20th century is 2 cm less than that of specimens collected in the 19th century for all species except D. polysetum Sw. Special attention has been paid to the delimitation of D. bonjeanii De Not. versus D. scoparium Hedw. and D. polysetum Sw. Within D. scoparium Hedw. three infraspecific taxa have been recognised, i.e. var. scoparium, var. alpestre Hueb. and var. curvulum Brid; the formerly recognised var. paludosum Schimp. is considered to be a modification (phenotypic expression of environmental variation) of var. scoparium.
20149506| The most important physiological adaptations of aquatic mosses are those permitting growth and survival at low light, and survival in a hydrated state at high temperatures. Low light adaptations seem to result in a shift in pigment ratio and a low light compensation point, coupled with growth in cold water. The ability to shift both compensation point and optimum with a shift in seasons is an important mechanism for surviving and growing in a hydrated state when terrestrial mosses are able to go dormant. Life cycle strategies take advantage of low, quiet water for fertilization, cool water and high light for growth, and moving water or emergence for dispersal. Several expected adaptations are missing. Chlorophyll does not increase with depth. Only CO and not bicarbonates are used in photosynthesis. Aquatic mosses lack the ability to increase photosynthesis over photorespiration when they are hydrated at temperatures above 20C; thus true aquatic mosses are virtually absent in the tropics. ///     -  ,                .    , -,             ,      .                      ,       .     ,    ,       ,       .    .      .

20149460| The presence of a multistratose leaf base in species of Fontinalis is interpretated as representing an extreme reduction and modification of a costa. This interpretation is supported by the presence of costae in some leaves of Fontinalis hypnoides var. duriaei. The near absence of a costa in Fontinalis is considered the result of the suppression of a multistratose structure in the leaves. This interpretation of the costate condition in Fontinalis is supportive of the idea, advanced by Robinson, that the strongly costate condition in some taxa could be secondarily derived from an ecostate or weakly costate condition. ///       Fontinalis  ,          .

20149514| The environmental gradients of most importance to mosses of aquatic habitats are water flow and water level fluctuation. Species that obtain their maximum development in stagnant water are limnophilous species, while those whose optimum development is in flowing water are rheophilous species. Obligate aquatic species have little or no tolerance or adaptation to drought conditions, while facultative aquatic species are tolerant of some degree of desiccation and xerophytic conditions. The semi-aquatic emergent habitat is one where adaptations are present that provide water for the terrestrially exposed growing portions from a hydrophytically disposed lower portion. Gametophytic adaptations to these habitats are not necessarily paralleled by sporophyte adaptations. Many species having aquatically adapted gametophytes have terrestrially adapted sporophytes. Other highly adapted limnophilous or slightly rheophilous taxa such as Fontinalis have highly aquatically adapted sporophyte features, including peristomial adaptations. The highly derived character states of aquatic mosses suggest that these plants have evolved from terrestrial ancestors. The wide diversity of phylogenetically unrelated families indicates that mosses have adapted to the aquatic environment in numerous independent lineages, and that character states these taxa have in common are the result of parallel evolution to a highly specialized habitat. The distribution of aquatic mosses is world-wide; however, observations of distribution patterns of aquatic taxa and abundance patterns of these mosses suggest that the aquatic mosses are more common in temperate than in tropical areas. ///               . ,      ,   ,     ,      ,   .              ,                .     ,   ,   ,         .           .  ,    ,    .        ,   Fontinalis,      ,   .        ,       .        ,          ,    ,    ,          .     , -       ,        ,        ,    . 
20149204| The taxonomy and karyology of the species of Cinclidium Sw. have been studied. It is concluded, that the genus comprises 4 species, viz. C. arcticum (B.S.G.) Schimp., C. stygium Sw., C. latifolium Lindb. and C. subrotundum Lindb. Infraspecific taxa have not been recognized. Sexuality, border of leaves, leaf point, flat shape of leaves, stereometry of leaves, pattern of areolation of lamina, and shape of the capsule are considered to provide good taxonomical characters. Description of the genus and the species are given with short remarks on their geographical distributions. Chromosome number of C. arcticum and C. latifolium are given for the first time, n = 7. The previous reported chromosome number of C. stygium and C. subrotundum, n = 14, are verified. The basic number for the genus is x = 7 (6+1 m), found in dioecious species only. Synoecious species are polyploid in terms of the gametophyte, n = 2x = 14.

20149814| The influence of light (small gaps vs shade), microsite (dry ridge vs wet ravine) and species of understory shrub (Hybanthus prunifolius vs Psychotria horizontalis) on a lowland tropical epiphyllous hepatic community were examined in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Epiphyll community structure and composition were strongly influenced by light and microsite but not by species of understory shrub. Epiphylls grew poorly in shaded environments and the dominance of species shifted in response to relatively small differences in moisture regime. The epiphyll Aphanolejeunea sicaefolia dominated in the dry microsite, but was relatively rare in the wet microsite, whereas the epiphyll Leptolejeunea elliptica dominated in the wet microsite and was relatively rare in the dry microsite. When growing in the same microsite, both species of shrub had similar epiphyll communities. These results suggest that epiphyllous hepatic community structure and composition are influenced by the patchy mosaic structure of tropical rainforests. ///    , ,    (    ),  (    )     (Hybanthus   Psychotria horizontalis)   ,   .            ,       .                   .

20149946|I examined various features of the demography and morphology of Polytrichastrum formosum from three spruce forest sites in southern and central Norway. At each site samples were taken from both boulders and soil, and from three positions within each turf. Each sample consisted of the P. formosum shoots found within a 1010-cm plot. Shoots from each plot were analysed in the laboratory with respect to leaf and capsule morphology, annual growth, shoot density, fecundity, and survival. Strong differences in morphology and annual growth were found, especially between the two geographical regions. The shoots and leaves from central Norway were larger than those from southern Norway. In southern Norway, there was a higher density of living and dead shoots, and they were more fertile. In southern Norway, shoot growth decreased in older shoots, whereas in central Norway shoot growth increased in older shoots.

20149463| In the top soil of two Dutch chalk grasslands a large reservoir of, probably chiefly vegetative, diaspores is present. From soil samples 37 species of bryophytes emerged, all of which have also been found above-ground recently or some years ago. The fern gametophytes emerging, however, originate from spores from elsewhere. In the above-ground vegetation, Perennials (pleurocarps and hepatics) dominate, but in the soil acrocarps, especially Colonists are more frequent. Below-ground diversity is high, with a mean of ca. 8 species in a 5 cm soil core. Seasonal variation in the diaspore bank is low for most bryophytes; the ferns show a peak in winter. It is suggested, that especially the vegetative diaspores are long-lived in the soil. ///             ,    .     37  ,      .    , ,    .

20150244| Sphagnum tescorum Flatberg (sect. Acutifolia) is described as a new species from subarctic Alaska. It can be recognized in the field by its brownish capitula with long, rather straight and suberect outer branches that rise above the inner part level of the capitulum when viewed from the sides, a distinct terminal bud, a predominantly greenish stem with pale brownish portions, and branch fascicles of usually two divergent and one pendent branch. Under a microscope, it is foremost recognized by the lingulate-spathulate stem leaves usually widest just below their distal end, a broadly fimbriate-truncate apex and sparse fimbriation along the lateral margins, and by a multiporose outer stem cortex. The new species is diploid and dioecious. The spores are large with a diameter of approximately 33 m. From morphological comparisons with related species, it is proposed that the new species is an allodiploid with S. girgensohnii and S. fimbriatum as the most likely parents. Material from Alaska, and the Chukotka area in eastern Russia has been examined for this determination. This indicates an amphi-Beringian species distribution. The species' preferred habitat seems to be lawns and hummocks in more or less topogenous, poor to intermediate tundra mires. 
20149732| Samples of aquatic bryophytes were collected from 170 sites in 32 rivers in Galicia (N.W. Spain). The mosses Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw., Brachythecium rivulare Schimp., Fissidens polyphyllus Wils., Rhynchostegium riparioides (Hedw.) Card., and the liverwort Scapania undulata (L.) Dum. were studied. These aquatic bryophytes showed higher chlorophyll concentrations than some terrestrial bryophytes. Stress rates, due to organic and metal pollution, were characterized on the basis of the chlorophyll contents and pigment ratios. D665/665a ratio provided the best results.

20149832| Electrophoretic data from 35 natural populations show that Plagiomnium curvatulum Wyatt & Stoneburner comb. nov. is an allopolyploid, with fixed heterozygosity in about one-third of the 17 loci surveyed. One of the progenitors of P. curvatulum is the haploid P. ellipticum. Among extant species of Plagiomnium section Rosulata, the European endemic P. elatum comes closest to matching the genetic profile of the other haploid progenitor. It appears likely that major changes in the gene pool of P. elatum occurred in association with Pleistocene glaciation in Europe, and losses of certain alleles may have obscured the relationship of this species to P. curvatulum. Alternatively, an ancestor of P. elatum (and possibly also the other European endemic, P. affine) may have been involved in the interspecific hybridizations that launched P. curvatulum as an allopolyploid species. In contrast to P. medium, which is a very recent derivative of P. insigne  P. ellipticum, P. curvatulum may be of more ancient derivation. In any event, the taxonomic implications of these findings are clear: P. curvatulum should not be treated as a subspecies of P. medium, but rather as a distinct species. Taxonomic confusion has resulted from the fact that both species have one parent in common (P. ellipticum) and overemphasis of the fact that both are bisexual. ///  ,   35   ,  Plagiomnium curvatulum Wyatt & Stoneburner . .           17  .

Perigonia and perichaetia are described for the first time in this species. Minor morphological differences between the Austrian and Norwegian plants are interpreted as a case of sexual dimorphism. Based on type specimens, problematical nomenclature is also treated. Didymodon hastatus (Mitt.) R. H. Zander is not considered a synonym. In the Alps, D. maschalogenus proved to be a stenoecious species, restricted as an early pioneer to moist, crumbling rocks of calcareous schist in the montane and subalpine belt.
20149357| Cytological and taxonomical research in the family Mniaceae is reviewed with special emphasis on chromosome numbers, karyotypes and their evolution, and polyploidy. From this, it is hoped, will be established a clear understanding of the Mniaceae including the interrelationships of the included genera and species. Thirty-one of the 47 listed species have been cytologically studied by this author. In these studies meristematic tissue of the gametophyte was used for squash preparations for obtaining chromosome counts and karyotype information. Species-pairs are recognized and each member given specific status because of their morphological differences as well as their independent self-maintenance in nature.

20149899|Orthotrichum notabile Lewinsky-Haapasaari (subg. Pulchella sect. Pulchella) sp. nov. is described from Sichuan, China. It is recognized by the erect or slightly flexuose dry leaves, the emergent capsules with immersed stomata, the double peristomes, with eight teeth splitting to sixteen when old and with eight smooth hyaline segments united by a connecting membrane, the prostome, the very large spores, and the strongly plicate, naked calyptrae. In addition, multicellular spores are reported from Orthotrichum dasymitrium Lewinsky and Orthotrichum erosum Lewinsky is reported as an epiphyte on Picea at 3320-3360 m altitude.

20150125| Moss remains in a sediment sample from Narsaarsuk near the Thule Air Base, NW Greenland (76 27 N, 69 35 W), were identified to obtain insights into vegetation and environmental conditions 119-123 ka BP. Thirty-two taxa were identified, seven of which had not been found as subfossils on Greenland before. Comparisons with modern habitats and geographical distributions of the mosses suggest the following. (1) The environment was mostly mineral-rich. (2) Terrestrial habitats had a sparse vegetation with mostly disturbance-tolerant species.. (3) At least some wetland habitats were somewhat nutrient-enriched, indicating that they were close to the sea or possibly bird cliffs. (4) The climate was arctic, but the summer had a longer period of above-zero mean temperatures than at present. The bryophyte finds support earlier published evidence from animal and vascular plant remains concerning influence by the sea and climate.

20150154|We present an overview of the bryophyte flora of five West Frisian Islands: Texel, Vlieland, Terschelling, Ameland and Schiermonnikoog. These islands comprise the most natural areas in the Netherlands and large parts are nature reserves. Over the last century the total number of bryophyte species recorded on the islands has increased rapidly, partly as a result of the increasing presence of woodlands and scrub. Of greatest bryological value are the calcareous wet dune slacks where many Red Data List species can be found. However, 7 out of 24 Red Data List species of these slacks have not been seen recently on the islands. Important causes of this decline are natural succession to less calcareous habitats, increasing vegetation cover, and extraction of drinking water on some islands. The dry grasslands and especially the north slopes of the dunes form another important habitat for rare bryophytes. Although the bryophytes of these grasslands suffer from changing vegetation structure and acidification of the top-soil, most rare species are still present on the islands. There is a strong suggestion that climate changes also influence the species composition of the bryophytes on these islands.
20150185|We screened six populations of the clonal forest floor moss Plagiomnium affine from forests of different ages for genetic variation at 23 allozyme loci. Samples consisting of two adjacent, unconnected shoots were taken at regular intervals along one transect from each population. Transect lengths varied from 22 to 52 m, depending on the size of the local populations. From a sample of 602 shoots, we detected a total of 16 haplotypes, of which two were widespread and 12 were unique to single populations.

20149518| Pigments of the most characteristic aquatic mosses of the river Muga were analysed, obtaining chlorophyll values of 0.18-0.51% dry weight of plant, 126-210 mg m leaf surface, and 200-1200 mg m substrate surface. These quantities are higher than those of river algae and are close to those of higher plants. Pigment evolution of the mossses displaced from their original collection sites to other stations of different water quality was followed for three months. The OD665/OD665 acid ratio, indicative of pheo-pigment proportion, was the variable that best assessed water pollution. From one to five weeks, depending on the species, the ratio was above 1.60 in the collection site (BOD 0.6-1.8 mg l O) and below 1.55 in the polluted station (BOD 10-23 mg l O).

20149881| Sphagnum tenellum was found mainly at sites below 1200 m a.s.l. with a mean annual precipitation of more than 1500 mm, and a mean annual temperature of 5-8C. Sphagnum compactum is mostly restricted to areas above 1000 m, occurs frequently at locations with a mean annual temperature below 0C, and grows well on bare peat. Niche-overlap (calculated by Levins' equation) is low for altitude and temperature, but high for frequency and quantity of precipitation and for snow-cover. In relation to other Sphagnum species S. tenellum shows narrow niche breadth for all habitat classes. Niche overlap is high between S. tenellum and S. cuspidatum, and between S. compactum and S. subsecundum. In sparsely populated habitats both mosses form single-species mats. In competition with other species S. tenellum survives mainly as single-stem individuals within loose mats of other plants, whereas S. compactum is often replaced by more competitive Sphagna. In an ordination by Detrended Correspondence Analysis, S. compactum shows relations to other bare peat species (Gymnocolea inflata), while the position of S. tenellum in the ordination diagram is similar to species like Rhynchospora alba, Sphagnum centrale and S. cuspidatum.

20149746|Metzgeria temperata, Cololejeunea minutissima, Cynodontium sp. and Orthotrichum rogeri are reported for the first time from The Netherlands. All were found on branches of Salix alba in extensive young willow forests in the Biesbosch (prov. Noord-Brabant and Zuid-Holland). The Biesbosch is the northernmost locality on the European continent for C. minutissima. The epiphytic habitat for Cynodontium is very unusual. It has not yet been found with mature capsules. The rare O. rogeri was found on four different sites.

20149331| Growth rates and metal contents (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu) of moss carpets were studied in southern Finland in seven Picea abies forests with a thin peat layer. The increment lengths for 1976 and 1977 were greater in the species growing in wet microhabitats (Sphagnum girgensohnii, Polytrichum commune) as opposed to the species occurring in somewhat drier microsites (Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum majus). Net annual dry matter production of S. girgensohnii averaged 191 g m, while the corresponding mean value for P. schreberi was significantly lower (98 g m). In vertical moss profiles, Cu and Zn concentrations decreased in P. commune from young to old segments, while in the other four species the levels of all metals increased with the age of moss, most steeply for Fe and least for Cu. On dry weight basis, the concentrations of Cu, Pb, Fe and Mn were lower in the green portion of Sphagnum than in Pleurozium (or other feather mosses). On an area basis, however, Sphagnum stands annually retained equal or higher amounts of the metals studied than the Pleurozium carpets. ///       Picea abies            (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu)  .   1976-77 .    ,     (Sphagnum girgensohnii, Polytrichum commune)    ,       (Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum majus).

20149724| Concentrations of 6 elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, S) were measured in surface cores of hummock growing Sphagnum species and in the water that accumulated below each core. Cores were taken from a wide variety of peatland types in four climatic zones in westem Canada. Calcium, Mg, Fe, and Na concentrations in the cores increased or remained the same with increasing depth. Potassium and S concentrations decreased with depth. Among elements studied, only Ca and Mg concentrations in surface water are related to concentrations in the moss. Such species as S. rubellum, S. pacificum, S. angustifolium, and S. warnstorfii that form small hummocks (height &lt10 cm), lawns, and carpets are never isolated from Ca and Mg concentrations in surface water. Effects of Ca and Mg in surface water on concentrations in such species as S. fuscum, S. austinii, S. papillosum, S. capillifolium and S. magellanicum, that form taller hummocks (height &gt10 cm), were not significant under conditions of moisture surpluses and highly significant for monthly periods of moisture deficits. ///    (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, S)       ,      ,    .               .

20149914|The extensive scattered literature on Hepaticae of the north of the Holarctic, in large part in Russia, is surveyed. The geographical distribution of a large number of taxa is discussed and in part amplified by the inclusion of unpublished locality data. The distribution patterns show sufficient variation that no general, unified theory is possible to account for all of the patterns seen. However, the accumulated data clearly show there is an extensive Arctic hepatic flora, much of which had been described from the American Arctic, which occurs, at least in lacunose fashion, from Siberia into European Russia. It is concluded that a considerable endemic Arctic flora exists, of diverse origin, but is in large part a flora that survived the Pleistocene in high-Arctic environments. Ultimately, the innate capacity to disseminate seems more critical in explaining current distribution of taxa in the far north than any scheme that relies only on periglacial survival for explanation.

20149652| Fluctuations in the cover, biomass and nutrient content (N, P, K) of bryophytes were followed during one year in five chalk grasslands in South Limburg (The Netherlands), while biomass was recorded once in five additional chalk grasslands. Biomass was higher on north-facing slopes than on south-facing slopes, probably because north-facing soils have a higher average moisture content. The biomass increased in the following order: abandoned grasslands -- grasslands burnt once a year -- grasslands mown in autumn -- grasslands grazed by sheep. The bryophytes, with biomass values up to circa 0.6 ton ha and cover values up to 60%, always formed a pattern consisting of dense patches interspersed with open spots. The biomass of the bryophytes is highest in autumn and spring whereas the biomass of the phanerogams reaches its lowest values during this time of the year. We suggest that the nutrient content of the bryophyte layer affects the nutrient cycle of the whole system. ///   ,     (N, P, K)               (),             .        ,      ,  ,          .      :   -      -    - ,   .       0.6         60%,   ,    ,    .       ,               .  ,           .

20149592| A similar pattern of sporeling development is shared by Pallavicinia subciliata, Symphyogyna aspera, and Podomitrium phyllanthus. This pattern is characterized by a two to few-celled filamentous stage, the growth of which is terminated by the production of an apical cell with two cutting faces. Limited segmentation of this cell and subsequent irregular divisions within both its derivatives and the basal cells, results in a juvenile plant composed of a cylindrical axis and massive basal region. The most significant variation in the development of these sporelings is seen in the time of sporoderm rupture. In Symphyogyna, the exospore is broken before any divisions occur, while in the remaining taxa, the spore wall usually stretches with the developing sporeling and is ruptured after a variable number of cell divisions. Variation in culture conditions influenced the rates of germination and the frequency of occurrence of a filamentous phase in Podomitrium. ///       Pallavicinia subsiliata, Symphyogyna aspera  Podomitrium phyllanthus.             ,           .     , ,      ,     ,    ,         .             .

20150176|The sand-steppe is a vegetation type mainly found in the southern Baltic region on calcareous sand dominated by vascular plants such as Koeleria glauca, Dianthus arenarius ssp. arenarius and Astragalus arenarius. Eighty-eight plots representing most sand-steppe sites in Scania, southernmost Sweden, were analyzed with respect to bryophytes, pH and exchangeable phosphate in the topsoil. The most common species were Syntrichia ruraliformis, Hypnum lacunosum, Ceratodon purpureus, Brachythecium albicans, Bryum argenteum, Syntrichia ruralis and Racomitrium canescens, but several rare or red-listed taxa were also found. Total species richness was reduced in plots with subneutral topsoil but uniformly high in plots with alkaline topsoil. In these latter, however, concentrations of exchangeable phosphate were found to have a major effect on the bryophyte flora. A significant negative relationship between total species richness and phosphate concentrations was found and most rare species were restricted to, or most frequent in plots with low phosphate availability. Only a few common generalist taxa appeared favoured by high phosphate availability. These findings suggest that management intended to conserve the sand-steppe vegetation should be designed to keep availability of phosphate low. Mechanical soil disturbance should be favoured over heavy grazing and burning.
20150078|The first unambiguous find of Sphagnum viride Flatberg in Sweden is reported. The habitat, a wet hollow in a bog in the large mire complex Kornosse in southern Sweden, was unexpected. S. viride is most often found in minerotrophic fens. Systematically S. viride is close to S. cuspidatum.
20149929|The relationships between 80 species in ca 50 "Hookerialean" genera are evaluated using cladistic methods. These genera were suggested to be related to each other in the literature or in an earlier overview study of the "Hookeriales", the Sematophyllaceae and some other taxa. Two larger clades, corresponding to the families Hookeriaceae and Callicostaceae were identified, in addition to a smaller one corresponding to the small family Leucomiaceae. The exact circumscription of the latter is, however, uncertain. The Daltoniaceae as understood by most recent authors is an ingroup in the Hookeriaceae, and if the Hypopterygiaceae species are related to the "Hookerialean" taxa this must be another ingroup in the same family. Twenty-four characters, eight from the vegetative gametophyte, eight from the sexual branches and eight from the sporophyte, appear to be the most important in circumscribing the two larger clades, and classifications based on only sporophytic or only gametophytic characters are considered unlikely to be correct. Character evolution in the two large families is discussed, and it appears that the common ancestor of the Hookeriaceae and the Callicostaceae had a short double nerve in the vegetative leaves, from which evolved a single, long nerve in the early members of the first family and a double, long nerve in the latter. The somewhat lesser structural stability of the leaves offered by the single nerve present in the Hookeriaceae, compared with the long double nerve in the Callicostaceae, seems to have been compensated for to some degree by the evolution of a well developed leaf border in many members of the first family. Short (in relation to their length) leaf lamina cells evolved in the ancestral Hookeriaceae and several times in the Callicostaceae. Several character states evolved mainly in one of the families, such as a stem hyalodermis, uniseriate basal marginal calyptra hairs and stomata with more than two guard-cells in the Callicostaceae, and many-celled upper portions of the axillary hairs, much-branched rhizoids and internal thickenings of collenchymatous exothecial cells in the Hookeriaceae. Other characters showed parallel evolution in the more apomorphic clades in these two families, for example the loss of vaginular and perigonial paraphyses and the evolution of erect capsules with strongly specialised peristomes.

20150168|This study investigates the conservation status of the redlisted bryophyte Sphagnum angermanicum in Sweden. The majority of the known Swedish localities were visited and population sizes estimated. pH, height above the groundwater table, horizontal distance to mineral ground, associated species and disturbance degree were investigated for each population. Sphagnum angermanicum was found in 19 of the 20 populations visited. Most populations were small, with eight occupying less than 5 m. The populations occurred on mires with mean pH of 4.9, mean height above the groundwater table of 18 cm and mean horizontal distance to the closest mineral ground of 25 m. There was a quadratic relationship between pH and population sizes, where the largest populations were found at intermediate pH (about pH 5). The low number and small sizes of the Swedish populations make them sensitive to environmental changes, stochastic events and deterministic habitat loss. There is thus a clear need for special conservation attention. The species seems to benefit from some kind of fine-scale disturbance like trampling of large mammals and wheel tracks of small cross-country vehicles. A map of the known Scandinavian distribution is presented and discussed in relation to the species' potential dispersal capacity.
lindbergia.35.76|Bryophytes have until now been absent from all hypotheses regarding the origin of insect pollination of seed plants. The discovery that both springtails and mites are able to transfer sperm in mosses makes it possible to suggest a 'Bryophyte precursor hypothesis of plant pollination' stating that animal-mediated fertilization in mosses and insect pollination in seed plants is historically linked by homologous or analogous evolution of structures responsible for attraction and reward aimed at a pool of fertilization vectors originally co-evolved with bryophytes and subsequently co-opted by seed plants. The earliest point in time when animal-mediated fertilization of bryophytes, involving springtails and mites, could have arisen is Late Silurian/Early Devonian, ca 280 Myr before the evolutionary radiation of angiosperms.

20149375|Three species of mosses are added to the known flora of the Faroe Islands. Voucher specimens are deposited in KUO and C.
20150006|The distribution of a species occurring in patchy habitats is mainly dominated by its dispersal abilities, the time interval of patch availability, and the inter-patch distance. An increase in distance or a decrease in patch size will have a negative influence on the size of bryophyte populations. However, in this paper we show that when distances between discrete patches are small, the distribution of the species of interest is mainly determined by the suitability of the different substrate types present and their distribution. The habitat parameters (substrate type, tree diameter and tree density) potentially explain 48% of the distribution pattern for Ulota crispa in the study area, whereas dispersal-related parameters (spatial co-ordinates and again tree density) hold a potential explanation of 36%. Of this 29% is overlapping in potential explanation. The distribution of Ulota crispa sensu lato within this study area is correlated most with the distribution of Salix caprea, Populus tremula and Fraxinus excelsior, and to some extent with Sorbus aucuparia and Acer pseudoplatanus. Betula pubescens, a prominent species within the study area, is regarded as a poor substrate, although a number of U. crispa cushions grow on it. The source of these cushions is probably neighbouring trees with better substrate characteristics. The models concerning population viability in relation to patchiness must incorporate the dispersal ability of the species, the distribution of different substrates, the time interval of availability of the particular habitat, the suitability of the different substrate types, and a parameter describing the relation of these variables to changing scales both in time and space.
20149372|The distribution of Polytrichastrum alpinum (Hedw.) G. L. Smith in Denmark and northern Europe is shown. In Denmark the species is confined to steep north-facing sandy slopes in northwestern Jutland and its distribution suggests that high summer temperatures prevent it from spreading further southwards. P. alpinum has migrated into its present Danish sites after about 5000 BC.
20149869| The seasonal variation in growth and nitrogen uptake and assimilation were studied in Dicranum majus Sm. growing in two Picea abies (L.) Karst. forests, one located in southern and the other in central Norway. The atmospheric nitrogen wet deposition was 10 times higher in southern than in central Norway during the investigated period. Growth and nitrogen uptake rates were highest in the population from central Norway, and seemed to be positively correlated with water supply at the two investigated sites. Concentrations and total amounts of nitrogen, soluble protein and chlorophyll were, however, highest in moss plants from the high-N site in southern Norway. Nitrogen and soluble protein concentrations varied, whereas chlorophyll concentrations remained stable during the investigated period. It is suggested that a high atmospheric nitrogen deposition in southern Norway has led to elevated nitrogen concentrations in D. majus due to luxury consumption and nitrogen accumulation. However, further studies under controlled conditions are needed to evaluate the effects of genetic and environmental factors on growth, nitrogen uptake and thus nitrogen concentrations in mosses. ///             Dicranum majus Sm.,    Picea abies (L.)

20150201|BRYOPLANET, a bryophyte population and landscape analysis network, was funded by the Nordic Research Board (Nordforsk) from 2001-2005 to arrange scientific meetings, workshops and courses for researchers and students on bryophyte ecology in the Nordic and Baltic countries. It provided a tool for connecting bryologists in the region and elsewhere. The network succeeded in connecting experienced researchers' broad knowledge with young enthusiastic post-graduate students with fresh ideas. In the final meeting of the network in Kked, Hungary on 19-22 August, 2005 and during the post-meeting excursion on 22-25 August, 2005, the present state of research was discussed with a strong emphasis on identifying the highlights and also the weaknesses in the many fields of bryophyte ecology today. The meeting consisted of seven invited retrospective lectures, offered by specialists in different fields of bryophyte ecology, and researchers and students had an opportunity to present ongoing projects to the audience. In addition to the lectures, the meeting consisted of 15 presentations ranging from phylogeographic patterns to morphological adaptations, population dynamics and genetics. Retrospective lectures have been published, along with some of the original papers presented at the Kked meeting. This introduction presents and evaluates the history, aims and outcomes of the BRYOPLANET network in addition to reporting on the final meeting in Kked.

20149549| Photosynthesis in certain forest and peat mosses (Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum majus, Sphagnum fuscum, S. angustifolium, S. nemoreum, S. magellanicum) was measured at various CO concentrations (250-1000 ppm). Net CO exchange rose almost linearly with increasing CO concentration. The percentage increase in the net CO exchange became greater with rising temperature. The photosynthetic optimum temperature was approx. 15C at 320 ppm CO and 20-25C at 1000 ppm. The relative increase in net CO exchange caused by rising CO concentrations was virtually independent of the irradiation in the range 70-500 mol m s PAR. The nature of the response to CO concentration at optimum moisture conditions was similar in all the species. The daily net photosynthesis of S. fuscum was simulated for some days using the environmental conditions prevailing in a drained peatland, a habitat where the daily fluctuation in atmospheric CO is relatively large. This daily CO fluctuation resulted at most in a 6.3% greater daily value than did the use of an even daytime concentration. Doubling of the CO concentration from 320 ppm to 640 ppm raised the daily net CO exchange 1.6-2.6-fold. The figures obtained in the simulation cannot be regarded as an exact prediction concerning growth or production, however, since too little is known about the long-term effects of increased CO. ///        (Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum majus, Sphagnum fuscum, S. angustifolium, S. nemoreum, S. magellanicum)      CO (250-1000   ).

However, increase in length was not restricted: the morphology of the shoots was adjusted to the tall neighbouring shoots and Ctenidium was not outcompeted by its tall neighbours during the experiment. Growth of Ctenidium was significantly better in thinned plots, where more light is available at sub-canopy level, than in natural plots. Growth of shoots of the two taller species, Rhytidiadelphus and Calliergonella, was independent of the neighbouring species; they were not able to overgrow patches of the smallest species during the course of this experiment. There was no or scarcely any advantage of growing in thinned patches for either Rhytidiadelphus or Calliergonella. Apparently, for these taller species, the positive effect of higher light availability in thinned plots was counteracted by the negative effect of deteriorated water economy.
20149883| Several tuber-bearing moss species may be very abundant in the diaspore bank, while their above-ground populations are extremely sparse. The maintenance of such populations seems to rely completely on occasional recruitment from the tuber bank followed by production of new tubers by the shoots. A simple, spatially explicit, simulation model was constructed to obtain hypotheses of mechanisms responsible for population regulation in such species. The results suggest that density-dependent tuber mortality in the soil is essential in this respect. The fact that at least some tubers are deposited at some (albeit small) distance from the parent shoot due to their production on comparatively long rhizoids also plays an important role. Future experimental work will test these ideas. ///  -         ,         .   , ,         ,      . ,           ,       .  ,             .  ,          ( )   -,            .        .

20111723| Vegetative plants of Pleurozia purpurea Lindb., grown in controlled environmental chambers, demonstrate that previous morphological descriptions of this species are symmetrically incorrect. As Schuster (1965) suggests in P. caledonica (Gottsche) Paris in Pleurozia the water sacs are on the dorsal surface, not the ventral as earlier held. Serial microtome sectioning was done to correlate apical cell structure and early merophyte development with this new interpretation of overall morphology. The apical cell is found to be dolabrate with only two cutting faces, and the developmental pattern of the two lateral segments is unique among the Jungermanniales. Before formation of leaf initials the expansive merophyte is divided into three segments. In each merophyte the dorsal segment undergoes a rapid series of distinctive divisions to form the complex water sac and one-half of the dorsal part of the stem, while the middle and central segments divide somewhat more slowly to form a shortly bifid lobe and one-half of the rest of the stem. Comparisons of early Plagiochila type branch development with this mature developmental pattern suggest that the shape of the apical cell likely influences the division patterns of the merophytes it produces. ///   Pleurozia purpurea Lindb.,      , ,       .

To test the hypothesis that such spores are short-lived in the soil environment, spores of Funaria hygrometrica were sown into four plots in a chalk grassland in The Netherlands. After two years, Funaria gametophytes still emerged from soil samples taken to the greenhouse. In the field, Funaria gametophytes did not emerge in the sown plots, which might be due to insufficient water or nutrients. ///     ,     ,      () .    ,       ,  Funaria hygrometrica          .

20150098|Matrix population models have, for more than 20 years, been popular analytical tools in studies of vascular plants, but have until recently not been applied to bryophytes. In this review we explain the rationale behind the simplest matrix modelling approaches, and show how to proceed when using such models in studies of bryophytes. Focussing on the life-cycle graph, we show how bryophyte "individuals", or modules, can be followed over time, and use data for Hylocomium splendens to exemplify how such analyses can be performed in practice. It is argued that the coloured-ring tagging technique which has now been successfully applied to bryophyte species of different growth forms and sizes for up to ten years, is applicable to a large range of bryophyte species except the smallest and, thus, that the major obstacle to following fates of bryophyte individuals over extended time periods has now been overcome. With reference to studies of vascular plants, we provide a long list of topics of interest to bryophyte ecology that call for population matrix modelling. We hope bryologists will take the challenge posed by matrix population models, and thereby contribute to bringing bryophyte population biology one more step forward.

20150046|This study provides information on the distribution of bryophytes in Portugal for three different time periods. The data are based on an extensive survey using records published since 1800. A review of the state of the art in bryological research in Portugal is outlined. The data allowed patterns of diversity and endemism among bryophytes to be explored. A provisional 'Gap Analysis' coupled with an analysis of complementary hot spots required for a full representation of all bryophytes in Portugal is presented. The potential for using bryophytes as an indicator group for biodiversity conservation is investigated and compared with data for pteridophytes, reptiles/amphibians and Trichoptera. The data and analyses presented in this paper are expected to provide basic guidelines for further definition of sites with special interest for bryophyte conservation and research.

20149726| The appearance of the axillary hairs has been studied in 200, mainly European species of pleurocarpous mosses. Representative hairs are illustrated for each species and the potential taxonomic value of the axillary hairs is discussed. Many genera which are rather poorly defined today do also include species with different kinds of axillary hairs, although this is not true for all genera which seem unnatural for other reasons. Genera which seem natural, based on other characters are mostly  homogeneous as regards the axillary hairs. Differences between closely related species were noted in some cases. On the other hand, axillary hair structure does not seem to give any good indications as regards which family a species belongs to. The appearance of the axillary hairs does not seem to be strongly related to the ecology of a species, and the present results indicate that the function of the hairs may not be to protect the growing shoot apex with mucilage. It is sugested that the characters of these hairs may be selectively natural. Finally, some hints on the practical use of axillary hairs in determination work are given. ///       ,   ,   .            .  ,    ,        ,       ,      . ,      , ,  , -   .          .      , ,      ,     .    , ,      ,    ,   ,  ,    ,        . ,        .             . 
20150209|Gemma formation in the Bryum bicolor complex is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. The morphology and number of bulbiferous gemmae in leaf axils are the major characters separating Bryum dichotomum Hedw. (incl. B. bicolor Dicks.) from Bryum barnesii Woods. Some authors claim that these characters intergrade and treat B. barnesii as a synonym of B. dichotomum. To evaluate the variability in bulbils shape and number within a population, B. barnesii was studied under controlled conditions. Bulbils were germinated on sterilized soil in a greenhouse and in a climate incubator. Protonemal growth, number of shoots, number of shoots with bulbils and number of bulbils per shoot were counted and the variability of bulbil shape was investigated. The number of bulbils per leaf axil was constant, but the shape of bulbils and leaves showed greater seasonal variability than mentioned in the descriptions of B. barnesii. In the climate incubator, bulbils also developed directly from a dense secondary protonema. Both types of bulbils can float on the water surface for several days and are therefore suitable for long distance dispersal along streams and shorelines with varying water levels. Apart from the number of bulbils per leaf axil, morphological differences between B. barnesii and B. dichotomum are small. Molecular analyses should be used to evaluate the relationship between these taxa.

20150096|The morphological relationships of Dicranodontium subporodicyton Broth. to Dicranum, Dicranodontium, Metzleria, Chorisodontium, and Campylopus are evaluated. We agree with Frahm that a definitive placement of this taxon will remain doubtful until sporophytes are discovered, but consider it best placed in Campylopus due to 1) presence of simple to multi-branched, reddish brown rhizoids borne on both surfaces of the costa and the stems at the branch bases; 2) costae with ridges or small lamellae on the dorsal surface; 3) leaves with thick-walled, porose upper laminal cells. In North America this taxon occurs primarily on the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, Canada with one locality on Vancouver Island, one on King Island, and one in the southwestern part of the province. A report of the species from southern Alaska is based upon a specimen of Ditrichum flexicaule (Schwgr.) Hampe.

20150178| Oncophorus elongatus (I. Hagen) Hedens (Oncophorus wahlenbergii var. elongatus I. Hagen) is a taxon that has been overlooked in northern Europe. The plants are 8-10 cm high, which is larger than those of O. wahlenbergii Brid., and form much looser tufts or grow singly among other bryophytes. Oncophorus elongatus additionally differs from O. wahlenbergii in its longer stem leaves, (3.7--) 4.5-7.2 mm long, which are more spreading than in the latter and more or less flexuose when moist. The leaf bases are also more strongly sheathing and mostly more strongly widened at their shoulder than in O. wahlenbergii, and the costa is broader, 71.5-124.0 m wide near its base. The acumen of the inner perichaetial leaves is longer than in O. wahlenbergii, (1.3--) 1.4-2.8 times as long as the sheathing part, and the spore capsules are larger and have a smaller length-to-width ratio than in the latter, although there is some overlap between the two. Oncophorus elongatus grows mainly in the subalpine and low-alpine zones, most frequently in mineral-poor or sometimes intermediately mineral-rich mires, or on brook and river shores. It seems to occur primarily in suboceanic areas of the Scandinavian mountain range, reaching coastal areas particularly in northern Norway.

20150050|Work started in the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) in 1993 on a Lower Plant Biodiversity Register. The idea did not progress beyond the early stages, but much of the thinking behind it is now being incorporated into the new National Biodiversity Network (NBN). This major initiative seeks to develop a dispersed network of data and expertise to facilitate the flow of information about Britain's flora and fauna in order to conserve and study it more effectively. To apply the NBN to plants, and particularly to bryophytes, the systems used must (a) ask the right questions, (b) be flexible and adaptable and (c) provide regular useful product. The philosophy behind the NBN is to devolve activity to where the expertise is, rather than attempt to create large central data banks. This ties in well with international initiatives promulgated by organisations such as Planta Europa, IUCN and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC). The European Committee for the Conservation of Bryophytes (ECCB) now has an opportunity to use these developing initiatives to promote bryophyte conservation throughout Europe.

20150204|Conservation biology is a discipline that is framed by ecology and biodiversity science on one side, and by management and environmental politics on the other. Conservation is a process that starts with the identification of threatened habitats/species/genotypes, continues with analyses of threats and finally results in actions to ensure the long-term survival of the species. This paper focuses on species conservation, not habitat conservation or conservation of genetic variation, which are equally important and distinct aspects of conservation biology. This paper addresses threats to bryophytes, and provides an evaluation process to determine how threatened a species is, along with suggested actions to conserve bryophytes and bryophyte diversity. The latter includes both the selection of sites for conservation, and some possible approaches for artificially saving species and genetic material for the future.

20149317| An attempt is made to compare bryophyte life histories with recent models of life strategies of animals and phanerogams. Important life history traits in bryophytes include the balance between sexual and asexual reproduction, the reproductive effort spent on both kinds of reproduction, the size and number of the spores, and annual production and standing crop. Age of first reproduction is generally low for asexual reproduction, but low or high for sexual reproduction, depending on the species and the population included. Density-dependent mortality appears to be rare in bryophytes; in some groups of species mortality is for the greater part caused by abiotic environmental stress, whereas in other groups biotic factors such as competition and predation are more prominent. Life expectancy varies from some weeks in extreme ephemerals to hundreds of years; in the longer lived species wide variation in life span of different individuals occurs. Tolerance and avoidance of environmental stress are two distinct alternative possibilities in bryophytes as well as in phanerogams. A preliminary system of six different bryophyte life strategies is presented. It is stressed that the choice of a fitness measure for a species or population should be made in accordance to its life strategy. Finally, some distinctive traits of bryophyte life histories are outlined. ///              ().               ,  ,     ,    ,      .     , ,   ,  ,      .        . ,             /  .         .

20111735|Notes on the distribution, ecology, and variability of the species of Eurhynchium in the Netherlands, following a revision of the herbarium collections. A key is given and maps illustrating the distribution in the Netherlands (dots refer to collections made up to 1920, squares represent more recent collections). After 1920 strikingly less fruiting collections have been made than before of E. striatum (1.5-3 vs. 45-50%), E. praelongum (4-8 vs. 40%), and E. hians (including E. swartzii, 1-2 vs. 12%). As the absolute number of 'fruiting' localities has dropped too, collecting after 1920 covers a larger part of the country (and much more intensively) than before, and changes in collecting habits do not seem to offer a plausible explanation, a true decline of the fertility appears to have taken place. The reason of this decline could not be clearly indicated but a connection between this and the general deterioration of the environment due to human influence seems obvious.
20150197|Morphology, physiology and biomass in two widespread bryophyte species, Hylocomium splendens and Racomitrium lanuginosum, were studied to examine the extent to which different species exhibit similar phenotypic variation patterns within and across regions. Analyses of nine morphological variables, chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, C/N ratio and biomass were conducted in samples from five sites in two geographically separated and climatically different regions, Iceland and northern Sweden. Both species exhibited large between-site variation in morphology, physiology and biomass, but with-in-site variation in morphology was substantially higher in Hylocomium splendens than Racomitrium lanuginosum. Morphological patterns were partly similar, partly different between the species, indicating that the two species respond morphologically to external factors on different scales. The lowest concentrations of chlorophyll and nitrogen were found at the same sites for both species, while the site of highest concentration was not the same. In Hylocomium splendens, chlorophyll content was positively correlated with biomass. Many of the observed relationships between morphological, physiological variables and biomass were species-specific. Our results demonstrate that the two bryophytes exhibit different phenotypic responses to environmental variation.

20149189|The "Kootwijkerzand" is an area of poor inland dunes partly covered by pine woodlands in the central part of The Netherlands. It harbours a comparatively rich liverwort flora, 21 species having been noticed here.

20111737|During the winter 1975-1976 an investigation was made of the bryophyte vegetation on ash trunks in the "Fazantenbos" (near De Steeg, prov. of Gelderland). This wood is situated on the transition from the loamy sand hills of the Veluwe to the valley of the river IJssel, and consists mainly of coppice. A comparison is made with results of other investigations during the past 25 years. A shift to a more acidophytic bryophyte flora is recognized for which the increased acidity of rain water is supposed to be responsible. In connection to this attention is drawn to some recent increases in area of acidophytic mosses and liverworts in the Netherlands.
20149934|To compare species richness and dominance of lichens vs bryophytes, we sampled Alnus rubra, Thuja plicata, and Tsuga heterophylla on the north and south sides in the first, second, and third meters of tree trunks on Ramsay Island. A total of 8 taxa of mosses, 14 of liverworts, 2 of lichens, and 1 fern were recognized. Liverworts were most abundant on the north side and at 1-2m on all three tree species. The rough mat growth form comprised both the highest cover and greatest number of species of bryophyte on each of the three tree species. This study supports the theory that moisture is the primary limiting factor in determining bryophyte vs lichen dominance on conifer bark, with bryophytes dominating in more moist sites.

20149469| Genetic variability in three populations of Racopilum spectabile and two populations of R. cuspidigerum was estimated by horizontal polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Eight of 22 tested enzyme systems were scorable; they represented 10 loci. The fraction of polymorphic loci in the most variable populations was 0.64 in R. spectabile and 0.55 in R. cuspidigerum. Estimates of gene diversity were 0.26 for both species, which is a high level of genetic variability compared with phanerogams. The genetic distance was positively correlated with spatial distance. Differences in allozyme frequencies between R. cuspidigerum and R. spectabile were considerably larger than differences within each species. One of the populations of R. cuspidigerum lacked genetic variability, which might be caused by asexual propagation. Maintenance of genetic variation within and origin of differentiation between populations are discussed.

20149186|The herbarium collections of Odontoschisma denudatum and O. sphagni from The Netherlands have been revised in connection with a study of the phenotypic variation and ecology of these species. In O. denudatum two natural modifications can be distinguished. Mod. pachyderma is more common and grows in young, open Erica-Calluna heath vegetation, on sandy ridges and rarely on tree trunks. Mod. mesoderma occurs in old, often N-exposed (Erica-)Calluna heath vegetation on shaded substrates. O. sphagni is far more common than O. denudatum and morphologically less variable. It is a characteristic species of oligotrophic bogs and wet heath vegetation. Rarely O. sphagni grows on tree trunks or in rather dry heath vegetation together with O. denudatum mod. mesoderma.

20150038|This paper considers the concept of rarity in bryophytes from two inter-related viewpoints: 1) distribution and abundance, and 2) a complex of factors relating to population biology and extent of genetic variation. A series of questions is posed, a fundamental one being "why do we wish to conserve rare species?". Following Rabinowitz, a species may be classed as rare if its distribution fits one of the three criteria of narrow or highly disjunctive geographical range, high habitat specificity, or consistently low population size. Some species are rare on all three counts. Others are classed as rare when they fit two or even only one of these criteria. Most species would be considered rare on this basis. There is evidence of correlation between rarity and failure to produce sporophytes, among species of both mosses and liverworts. This relationship holds good only for dioecious taxa, however, and thus it is not clear to what extent rarity results from restricted diversity among genotypes consequent upon a bypassing of meiosis. Some rare bryophytes are long-lived perennials, but many are colonist or shuttle species with relatively short-lived gametophytes. Provision of successional habitats will be essential in their conservation management. Some rare species may be phylogenetically isolated. while other may be members of large assemblages of closely related, possibly currently evolving species in genera such as Bryum. Molecular studies, such as our work on the striking pattern of variation within the cosmopolitan species Bryum argenteum, have shown that many common bryophyte species exhibit greater degree of genetic diversity than might be expected in haploid-dominant organisms. This raises the question whether conserving races of common but genetically variable taxa such as B. argenteum might not be at least as valuable as conserving some rare but more uniform species that are closely related to common ones. It also emphasises that our efforts should be directed towards maintaining the largest possible areas of natural and semi-natural vegetation as reservoirs of genetic diversity at the population level, as well as towards conserving priority species.

20149928|Anomobryum lusitanicum (I. Hag. ex Luis.) Thr., an endemic moss from the Iberian Peninsula, is characterized by the appressed, imbricate, scarcely concave leaves with excurrent nerves. As in most Anomobryum species, this moss has leaves with narrow, incrassate vermicular upper leaf cells. The capsules of A. lusitanicum are ovoid to pyriform, with large apophyses that are shorter than the urn, and with reduced peristomes. Filiform rhizoidal gemmae are sometimes developed at the ends of caulinar rhizoids. This type of specialized vegetative propagule is only referred to this species of Anomobryum. New information is presented on peristome and gemma morphology, ecological conditions and geographical distribution.

The tubers of Dicranella humilis, D. subulata, Ditrichum heteromallum, D. lineare, D. cylindricum, Didymodon tomaculosus, D. tophaceus, Tortula amplexa and Pohlia melanodon are referred to the same type. Two other types of rhizoidal tubers are marked off, viz. tubers that are built up by the activity of an apical cell with two or three cutting faces and represent a regularly grown body of cells and other tubers representing an irregular cell complex. The tubers of Dicranella rufescens contain big starch grains which are described and illustrated. ///       Dicranella rufescens.       .

20150040|We examine relationships between reproductive system, sporophyte and asexual propagule production and rarity for the 289 species comprising the British hepatic flora. Contingency analyses reveal that 1) a much higher proportion of non-fruiting species is rare than of those which do fruit in Britain, 2) a higher proportion of dioecious than of monoecious species fails to produce sporophytes, and 3) among species which do produce sporophytes a much higher proportion of monoecious than dioecious species is rare. Dioecious and monoecious species therefore show different relationships between sporophyte production and rarity, with most rare dioecious species failing to produce sporophytes in Britain while most monoecious rare species produce them at least occasionally. Dispersal limitation is thus a possible cause of rarity for dioecious hepatics, but is not a tenable explanation for rarity in monoecious taxa. A possible explanation is that monoecious taxa become rare through the erosion of genetic variation by inbreeding, but no data exist at present to support this hypothesis. These findings are compared with a previous study of British mosses that arrived at similar conclusions. Production of asexual propagules shows no demonstrable association with rarity category or sexual system, but species that produce neither asexual propagules nor spores constitute the category most likely to be rare.
20150228|We present a method that permits the retrospective assessment of frequency changes in species, based on the evaluation of specimens in biological collections. The method assumes that the increase and decrease in the frequency of a species is reflected in the number of collected specimens. A comparison of the specimen numbers from different time periods allows for an evaluation of the frequency changes of a particular species, provided that the specimen numbers are corrected for the general collecting activity of each time period. We used a reference data set consisting of 10 521 specimens of 85 species to reflect general collecting activity. For 42 species of bryophytes in Switzerland, we calculated the 'relative collecting activity', i.e. the number of specimens of an individual species as a percentage of the number of specimens from the reference data set. We examined changes in the relative collecting activity between the periods 1850-1939 and 1940-1999, using a permutation test. The calculated results were further assessed, taking all background information on each single species into account. In seven cases, the resulting assessments differed from the test results. According to the assessments, 16 species showed a decline and four had increased. The frequency of seven species was considered stable. For the remaining 15, mainly rare species, reliable assessments depend on further study of their former and actual frequencies. When species analysed were arranged into three classes of rare, medium and high frequency, the results showed that the rare and medium frequency species underwent significant decline, whereas the common species were stable. The fact that 12 species of medium or high frequency have most probably declined is of particular interest.

20149964|Forty species were selected from the Swedish Bryophyte Red List in order to test the new IUCN Criteria with help from the guidelines proposed in this issue of Lindbergia. The species were selected to represent different distribution types, morphology types, life strategies, habitats and threats. The results show that out of 40 species selected from the old Red List (following the old IUCN categories), all but one of the Data Deficient species were now considered to be Red List species, according to the new IUCN system. Among the old 25 "Threatened" species (E, V, R) 18 (72%) are still classified as "Threatened". Among the 14 species formerly considered to be "Care demanding", eight were now considered truly "Threatened" (CR, EN, VU) according to the new system. The remaining species met the criteria for Lower Risk (nt). This indicates that using the new system may result in somewhat longer Red Lists than the old one. Most problems with the application of the new system to bryophytes concern the interpretation of the terms 'area of occupancy', 'length of generation', and how to define an 'individual'. The way bryophytes often reproduce by cloning and other forms of asexual dispersal makes them difficult to fit into a category system that pays so much attention to mature individuals and length of generations. Rate of decline was discussed and a frequently used option was to estimate the decline of habitat quality and/or contraction of habitats important for the survival of species. Aspects of reproductive capability and dispersal ability would have been important to consider but are missing in the system. To conclude, the new IUCN threat categories are applicable to bryophytes. The most useful options seems to be to predict decline and estimate rarity with help from distribution and habitat data.

Bryum gemmiparum was collected in a clay-pit along the river Maas in the north of the province of Limburg. This locality seems to be the northernmost one known of the species. Bryum gemmiparum was found growing on steep, rather humid, loamy soils in a luxuriant cover of bryophytes characterized by Anisothecium varium, Riccardia sinuata, Riccardia pinguis, Bryum bicolor, Didymodon tophaceus, and Mniobryum wahlenbergii.

20150062|The composition and diversity of the bryophyte flora of four 13-yr-old windthrow gaps and their adjacent forest stands was studied in the Bavarian Forest National Park, south eastern Germany. The sites belong to two forest types, a mixed montane forest and a wet spruce forest. One gap in each forest type had been cleared after the storm event but not reafforested, the other had remained unchanged. Species richness was higher in gaps than in the undisturbed forest and higher in uncleared gaps than in cleared ones. It is suggested that the higher diversity in unmanaged gaps is mainly due to the formation of additional habitats (treefall pits and mounds) while most of the forest floor and its vegetation remains intact. The forest floor of cleared gaps is heavily disturbed which promotes the development of a dense cover of grass. This in turn suppresses most bryophyte species. An analysis of the life strategy spectra (sensu During) shows that in most microhabitats, in both the forest and windthrow areas, long-lived species (mostly perennials s. str.) predominate. For the gaps this is probably due to their age and the advanced colonization of open habitats. In contrast to this there is a clear dominance of the colonist strategy in the diaspore bank.

20149995|Experimental studies on water loss, absorption of water vapour, field water content and tolerance to desiccation and rehydration were undertaken in seven moss species growing in xeric and humid pine forests of Tenerife. The species that showed the highest drought tolerance were Hedwigia ciliata, Bartramia stricta, Grimmia laevigata and Grimmia trichophylla. The order of the species according to desiccation tolerance may be related to the aridity conditions of the habitat. Mosses with slow absorption of water vapour and great water loss resistance were those that showed the highest field water content (Polytrichum juniperinum, B. stricta and Anacolia webbii), although the values of field water content were low for all species (&lt140% of dry weight). These mosses were growing preferentially on soils. Species that showed fast rates of absorption of water vapour and of water loss, and the lowest field water content, were those growing on rocks (H. ciliata, G. laevigata, G. trichophylla and Pterogonium gracile).

20150004|Spores and fragments of Schistidium rivulare, Racomitrium aciculare, Dicranoweisia crispula, Oligotrichum hercynicum and Ceratodon purpureus were stored dry or in water for up to six months. Diaspores of all studied species survived for some time in water. Spores of S. rivulare showed a higher survival rate over time than spores of any of the other species, and the regeneration frequencies of fragments were highest in S. rivulare. For all species except S. rivulare, the germination frequencies of spores kept in water were significantly lower than of the spores kept dry at almost all time intervals. Hence, of the studied species, S. rivulare is thought to have the highest probability for surviving water transport, although water dispersal is not ruled out for any of the species. In general, the absolute regeneration frequencies of fragments were lower than the germination frequencies of spores. However, the fragments of all species generally survived as well in water as when stored dry, indicating a better tolerance towards water submergence for fragments than for spores.
20150196|The effects of simulated shade in terms of reduced light quantity (PPFD) and changed red:far-red ratio (R:FR ratio) on the growth in length, in number of branches and in biomass, were examined in a greenhouse experiment with Hylocomium splendens and Racomitrium lanuginosum, two species from habitats with different light conditions (with H. splendens often in more shaded microsites). Using ten intact moss turfs per species which had been collected on Iceland at 4 m distance between replicate turfs, we tested, whether light quantity affected growth and biomass, whether changes in light quantity and red:far-red ratio affected the number of branches, and whether the two species differed in these responses. Reduced light quantity (i.e. PPFD level) caused a greater length increase, decreased biomass, and biomass:length ratio in both species, but the magnitude of response varied greatly between species. Furthermore, in R. lanuginosum spectral shade (i.e. reduced PPFD and a lower R:FR ratio) generally caused stronger responses than neutral shade, with only a reduction in PPFD. H. splendens (from the shaded habitat) responded less strongly to the shade treatments than R. lanuginosum (from the open habitat) did. In addition to these effects of shading, there were strong effects of the turf of origin in both species, and in many cases the interaction between turf of origin and shading treatment was significant as well.

20149631| Soil samples taken in a range of habitats around Barcelona, including shrubland in a karstic area close to the sea, more continental gypsum sites, and montane Quercus pubescens and Fagus sylvatica forests, contained a varied diaspore bank of bryophytes. Particularly from the samples of the forest sites, considerable numbers of fern gametophytes emerged also. In all sites, the diaspore bank presumably consisted mostly of asexual propagules -- tubers, gemmae, leaf fragments, and in the case of hepatics and pleurocarpic mosses, decaying stem parts with some still viable cells. Ferns and annual/ephemeral bryophytes were probably present in the soil as spores. Irrespective of the above-ground bryophyte vegetation, species of the Colonist life strategy were dominant in the diaspore bank. Seasonal variation in the numbers of diaspores present was not observed, even though the sampling dates were just before and after the main period of spore release of some species that locally produced abundant sporophytes.

20149304|The effects of management experiments in grassland and heath in the Eexterveld, NE-Drenthe, on the bryophyte vegetation were studied. The species composition before the beginning of the experiments (1972) has been compared with that of four years later (1976). Grazing (by sheep) changes the composition of the bryophyte vegetation strongly locally. In the heath liverworts disappear and acrocarps decrease. In the grassland pleurocarps show a tendency to disappear whereas many turf forming acrocarps have appeared. In mowed grassland the pleurocarps increase. Patches, from which formerly sods were cut, are still recognizable after 4 years by the high number of acrocarps in the heath as well as in the grassland. The composition does not change when the heath is left undisturbed or when fertilizers are added to the grassland.
20149203| A taxonomic revision is made of the genus Dawsonia, which is, following Smith, placed in the family of the Polytrichaceae. The two sections (Dawsonia and Superba) as amended by Smith are accepted. D. longiseta is placed in section Dawsonia. The section Superba has been divided in two species complexes, viz. the ecrenate complex (lamellae straight: D. superba, D. gigantea and D. grandis) and the crenate complex (lamellae crenate: D. beccarii, D. lativaginata, D. pullei and D. papuana). One new variety has been described: D. beccarii var. longivaginata Zant. & P. Heuk. The following new combinations are proposed: D. superba var. pulchra (Wijk) Zant., D. beccarii var. limbata (Dix.)

The following new synonyms are proposed: D. intermedia (= D. superba var. pulchra), D. celebensis (= D. superba var. superba), D. crispifolia (= D. beccarii var. limbata), D. robbinsii (= D. beccarii var. limbata). D. papillata has been reduced to Pogonatum wallisii (C. Muell.) Jaeg. The diagnostic morphological characters are discussed. There are 9 species recognized, 2 of which are divided into varieties. An identification key is provided and for each taxon the following information is given: synonymy together with literature and typification, misidentifications, description, geographical distribution (usually with maps), ecology and notes. Each species is illustrated, and a list is given of the examined specimens. The phylogeny within the genus has been discussed and it has been argued that the genus originated in Antarctica-Australia. New Guinea is considered to be a secondary centre of evolution. Sect. Dawsonia is considered to be older than sect. Superba. A method has been worked out to detect which characters are primitive and which derived. The hygroscopic movements of the leaves are discussed. The "hinge-movement" is not caused by the swelling-tissue but by the peculiar structure of the lamellae at the hinge-joint and the quality of the cells of the nerve. The dispersal has been discussed. Long-range dispersal by air-currents is highly unlikely.

Leucodon sciuroides - almost exclusively epiphytic in the Netherlands -- is reported from a rocky substratum.
20149191|Several interesting bryophytes were found on an artificial cascade constructed of pieces of limestone from the Belgian Ardennes in 1934. Some of these have already been reported by Veth & Koopmans (1968). It is suggested that at least some of the bryophytes have been introduced with the stones. The most interesting find was Plasteurhynchium striatulum, which was not recorded previously from The Netherlands.
20150153|The habitats of three wetland mosses in the genus Palustriella are evaluated based on numerous chemical parameters of their habitats in Sweden, the climate in Sweden and the European Alps, and their phylogenetic relationships. The phylogenetic analysis, where Cratoneuron was also included in the ingroup, suggests that P. falcata (Brid.) Hedens is the ancestral Palustriella species and that P. commutata (Hedw.) Ochyra and P. decipiens (De Not.) Ochyra evolved later. Palustriella falcata is found under a wide range of habitat conditions, in a relatively mild climate in very mineral-rich habitats or in habitats with more moderate mineral concentrations in a harsher climate. Palustriella commutata grows under very high mineral levels, relatively high nitrate levels (possibly a result of pollution rather than a habitat requirement), and in a relatively mild climate. Palustriella decipiens is found in harsh climates but can grow at relatively low mineral levels and is not restricted to strongly calcareous habitats. We hypothesise that the two latter species have kept or evolved further adaptations to parts of the realised niche of P. falcata. The differences in habitat preferences between the three species explain why P. commutata and P. decipiens have narrower geographical distribution ranges than P. falcata.

20149802| An inventory of an Ecuadorean Amazonas lowland tropical rainforest at Aangu contained 50 species of mosses distributed among 20 families and 33 genera. Twenty are new to the Amazonas of Ecuador, and eight are new to the country: Dolotortula mniifolia, Fissidens inaequalis, F. intermedius, F. intramarginatus, F. steerei, Pinnatella minuta, Pseudocryphaea flagellifera and Splachnobryum obtusum. Species richness at Aangu is similar to that recorded by others at Moraballi Creek, Guyana, and for west Suriname -- a low species richness compared to higher elevational zones in the Neotropics. For any given site of a few hectares in the neotropical wet lowland forests the number of mosses probably rarely exceeds 50 species and often is much lower. Comparison between the whole of Ecuadorean Amazonas and the Manaus region in Brazil shows similar species richness but significant differences in floristic composition at both generic and species level, possibly a reflection of historic vegetational differences between the upper and lower Amazonas region. /// ,            50  ,   20   33 .      ,      : Dolotortura mniifolia, Fissidens inaequalis, F. intermedius, F. intramarginatus, F. steerei, Pinnatella minuta, Pseudocryphaea flagellifera  Splachnobryum obtusum.       ,       ,     -             .                 50     .                ,            ,     , ,           .

20149240| During 1973 an investigation of the richly developed epiphytic bryophyte vegetation in the forest, Slotved Skov, 10 km E of Hjrring, Northern Jutland, Denmark was undertaken. The variation in distribution pattern on the two phorophyte species, Fraxinus excelsior and Fagus silvatica, was described by recordings from 600 systematically placed sample plots. Horizontal and vertical variations combined with variations due to inclination of the phorophytes were estimated by statistical methods. It was concluded that epiphytic bryophytes on Fraxinus grow most frequently at the trunk bases and on the 'upper' side of the trunks, but no preferences for any points of the compass were observed. On Fagus no distinctions of distribution frequencies could be made. Forest-floor vegetation was described and compared with the epiphytic flora on the trunk bases. A certain common element was recognized, Isothecium myurum, Plagiothecium succulentum, Brachythecium rutabulum, B. reflexum, Plagiomnium undulatum, Oxyrrhyncium swartzii, Lophocolea bidentata and Plagiochila asplenioides at Fraxinus, and Hypnum cupressiforme, Dicranum scoparium, Plagiothecium succulentum, Mnium hornum and Lophocolea heterophylla at Fagus. Diversity expressions were calculated in order to obtain a picture of the organizational patterns exhibited by the epiphytes. On Fraxinus, where the higher diversity values were obtained, total diversity decreased upwards along the trunks, while this trend was not followed on Fagus. Diversity was always low on much inclined trees, while on more perpendicular trees it might be either high or low. Association analyses were made in order to show the positive or negative association among epiphyte species and their relations to environmental factors. In this investigation only strictly objective statistical methods are applied, and no comparisons to the groupings set up by the Zrich-Montpellier school of phytosociology are attempted. ///   1973            , 10 .  ,  , .       , Fraxinus excelsior  Fagus silvatica,      600    .    ,      ,    . ,              ""  ,       -  .         .            .     --  : Isothecium myurum, Plagiothecium succulentum, Brachythecium rutabulum, B. reflexum, Plagiomnium undulatum, Oxyrrhynchium swartzii, Lophocolea bidentata  Plagiochila asplenioides -  : Hypnum cupressiforme, Dicranum scoparium, Plagiothecium succulentum, Mnium hornum  Lophocolea heterophylla.   ,       ,  .  ,       ,      ,          .       ,               .   ,                .         ,        ,    Zrich-Montpellier.

20150043|Petalophyllum ralfsii (Wils.) Nees & Gott. is the only species of the genus in Europe, and has an Oceanic-Mediterranean distribution. As a threatened (vulnerable) species in Europe, it is included in Appendix I of the Bern Convention and in Annex 2 of the EC Habitats and Species Directive. Although recorded for several European countries, many of these reports are old and the recent collections are mainly from the coast of the British Isles. In the Iberian Peninsula, it is known only from the south of Portugal (two localities in the Algarve) and from the Balearic Islands. The report from the Azores (Faial) is erroneous. Information on the Portuguese populations is given, as well as comments on the ecological requirements of this liverwort. Some morphological details of the gametophyte, spore and elater morphology are presented. The normal habitat in Algarve shows that Petalophyllum ralfsii can benefit by grazing and some human activities. Conservation measures are suggested and discussed.

20150150|Forest floor bryophytes of the laurel forest of Gomera (Canary Islands) were studied to detect patterns of variation in species composition and life strategies of the bryophyte communities among stands of different trees. Environmental variables that best predict richness, cover and bryophyte composition were assessed. Twenty six moss and 21 liverwort species were found in 59 sample plots and 201 sub-plots. Seven types of forests were distinguished by TWIN-SPAN according to tree composition, but only the three types "broad-leaved forests", "old ericaceous forest" and "second-growth ericaceous forest" had an associated bryophyte community. The main differences between these three types may be related to structure (total basal area and canopy height), tree composition (ericaceous/broad-leaved) and microclimate (related to mist precipitation and throughfall). The perennial stayer life strategy had the highest number of species and cover in all three forest types; however, the perennial competitive sub-category was only abundant in the second-growth ericaceous forest. The long-lived shuttle life strategy was dominant in old ericaceous forest. The presence of colonist species sensu stricto seems related to fine-scaled disturbances in the forest floor of the broad-leaved forest and also with drought stress in small patches of the ericaceous forests. Short-lived shuttle species were very scarce in the study area. Patterns in species richness, cover and life strategy distribution suggest that light intensity, mist precipitation and disturbance are the most important factors for forest floor bryophytes in Garajonay National Park.
20111722| A taxonomic revision is made of the species of Thuidium, Pelekium, and Rauiella in Africa south of the Sahara. Brotherus's classification of the genera and their subdivisions has been accepted without change, but some critical remarks and suggestions for a future classification are made. 14 species of African Thuidium are recognised, 24 reductions are made within this genus, and 2 new combinations are proposed: T. gratum (P.

20149868| Persistence, the tendency of a species to remain in its original position and not to colonize new sites, is studied for 36 bryophyte species in spruce forest and 20 species (including 7 lichens) in pine forest in S Norway. Data sets include presence/absence in 199 meso plots (1 m) with 3184 subplots (1/16 m), analyzed with a 5-yr interval, and a subset with 50 meso plots and 800 subplots, analyzed for six consecutive years. Persistence was calculated for different temporal (1-5 yr) and spatial (1/16 and 1 m) scales. Patterns in the spruce and pine forests were closely similar, and two main components of variation in persistence were demonstrated by PCA analyses: (1) the absolute level of persistence which is strongly associated with size and runs from small bryophytes (mostly hepatics) to large mosses, hepatics, Sphagnum and lichens, and (2) variation related to spatial scale. No variation in persistence could be attributed to main local environmental complex-gradients, but variation in absolute persistence coincided with a micro-scale coenocline. Persistence is discussed in relation to real and apparent disappearances and colonizations. Strong size-dependence of persistence is suggested a typical property of cryptogams, on the levels of species as well as individual shoots. The results add to previous evidence suggesting low importance of interspecific competition in the boreal coniferous forest floor. /// ,            ,    36       20  ( 7 )      .    /  199   (1 )  3184  (1/16 ),    5 ,    50    800 ,   6  .

27809533|Sphagnum venustum Flatberg (Bryophyta, sect. Acutifolia) is described as a new species from Labrador, Canada. The new species is foremost characterized by its tender and soft plants with a varying element of pale brown colour in branches and stems, long divergent branches with slender, whitish distal ends, a weak stem, loose stem leaves that are predominantly lingulatetriangular in shape with subacute apices, but which often have a varying degree of eroded and resorbed cells in their distal part and apices, short branch leaves compared to the stem leaves, few hyalocyst pores on the convex surface of the divergent branch leaves, retort cells of the branch cortex with distinct neck, and by the often broad shape of the chlorophyllose cells of the branch leaves as viewed in transverse section. The species is also characterized by the wide intra- and interplant variation found in morphological attributes. The new species has so far been found in four mire localities in the northern boreal zone of southern Labrador. According to current knowledge it is endemic for this region, but more localities are likely to be discovered. It is found in poor fens, with a preference for lawn and carpet communities in both soligenous and topogenous sites, and with more occasional occurrences in hummock habitats. It is the only known brown-coloured boreal species in sect. Acutifolia that shows a preference for poor fen lawn and carpet communities. Sporophytes and antheridial branches have been found once, and the species is most likely dioicous. The relationship of S. venustum to other Acutifolia species is difficult to evaluate from morphological criteria, and it displays morphological traits that point to possible evolutionary lines to several other boreal species in the section.

Examination of the fructification frequencies shows that the monoecious species are fruiting more frequently than the dioecious. An examination of the spores in the scanning electron microscope has shown that in all species the spore surface is ornamented, but the details could be seen only in the transmission electron microscope. Sporophyte characters (i.e. ornamentation of the spores) support the grouping of the species based on the morphology of the gametophyte. ///       Plagiotheciaceae.    ,    .       ,        ,          .

20149157|During a number of excursions in June and October 1969 the exploration of the moss-flora of the Dutch island of Schiermonnikoog has been continued. The results were 6 new records for the island, viz. Amblystegium compactum, Antitrichia curtipendula, Calliergon giganteum, Campylopus introflexus, Polytrichum formosum and Sphagnum plumulosum. Antitrichia was found within the Cryphaeetum arboreae with Amblystegium serpens, Brachythecium rutabulum, B. velutinum, Hypnum cupressiforme, Homalothecium sericeum and Orthotrichum pulchellum as its direct associates on a horizontal stem of Sambucus nigra. During the past century Antitrichia was not rare in the Netherlands, but there were only 2 recent finds.
20150130|Avala Mountain (511m altitude) is covered by deciduous forests.

20149735|The hepatic Metzgeria fruticulosa (Dicks.) Evans occurs in southwestern Sweden, Denmark and southern Norway in Fennoscandia. The species is most frequent in localities with a high relative air humidity, and shows a preference for trunks of living trees of relatively small diameter with smooth bark and a bark pH of 5.4-7.0. The most common phorophyte is Fagus sylvatica L., but the hepatic also occurs on other tree species, especially Acer platanoides L., and is often associated with Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. and Ulota crispa (Hedw.) Brid. M. fruticulosa seems to be competitively inferior to other epiphytes found in its habitat. The ecology of the species differs slightly in different parts of Europe.
20149912|The composition and structure of bryophyte and fern diaspore banks were studied in three agricultural fields situated at two different localities in the vicinity of Bern, Switzerland. Soil cores were taken in profiles at depths between 1.5 and 50 cm at three positions in each field. Fifteen bryophyte species and a considerable number of fern gametophytes representing at least two taxa emerged from these soil samples cultivated during seven months. The number of fern prothallia did not differ significantly between the two localities at different distances from sporophytic fern populations. Significantly fewer prothallia and fewer hornwort sporelings appeared, and protonemata of mosses showed a tendency to grow less vigorously, in soil samples from below 25 cm compared with those above. Agricultural management (regular ploughing at 20 to 25 cm) is considered to be mainly responsible for this overall vertical distribution pattern. Both the complement of Srensen's Index and Canonical Correspondence Analysis show that the bryophyte species composition of the diaspore bank varies more between than within fields and most strongly between fields from different localities. Within fields, the floristic composition tends to vary more with depth than between profiles. Dicranella staphylina, D. schreberiana, Bryum rubens and one to two Pottiaceae (Pottia sp., Phascum sp.) were common in the diaspore banks of all fields; a few species were present below-ground but not on the surface of the particular field; and diaspores of Eurhynchium hians and Riccia sp. did not occur at depths greater than 15 cm.

20149711| Potassium orthophosphate solution (5 mol m) was sprayed onto pure swards of Pseudoscleropodium purum in Windsor Forest, UK, to study uptake and retention of K and P by the moss carpet. Before, and at intervals following eight successive daily applications of KHPO, the concentrations of P (intracellular) and K (intercellular, exchangeable, intracellular) were assayed in apical (0-2 cm) and subapical (2-4 cm) tissues. Throughfall of these elements from the moss and litter layer was determined using collectors placed beneath the sward. Appreciable net uptake of K and P occurred in apical and subapical segments of P. purum. Intracellular levels of both elements were highest in the apex and greatest net uptake also occurred here. Levels of the added nutrients fell progressively on cessation of the nutrient applications, although for P the concentration in treated plants remained significantly above the controls after 74 d. No evidence was obtained for a net transfer of nutrients from apex to subapex so that the decline probably represents true loss rather than internal redistribution of elements. Only 6.3% of the added P and 12.1% of added K were recovered in moss throughfall after 74 d although levels in the living moss had fallen to 31% and 23%, respectively, of the maxima recorded after nutrient application. It is suggested that the missing fraction had been sequestered by microorganisms or remained uneluted in the litter. Although P. purum appears to have a low capacity to directly utilise nutrients received in wet deposition, the elements in the litter/microorganisms might eventually re-enter the living moss by mass flow. ///    (5 mol M)       Pseudoscleropdium purum   , ,           .

20150208|A detailed investigation of spore release and dispersal from an isolated colony of Phascum cuspidatum Hedw. indicated that approximately 98% of the spores originally present remained within the colony. The spatial distribution of colonies of P. cuspidatum and Pottia truncata (Hedw.) Frnr. in relation to those of the previous year was investigated by mapping the occurrence of colonies in five permanent quadrats for each species during two successive years. Phascum cuspidatum reoccurred in three quadrats during the second year, and P. truncata in only one, in the latter case apparently due to invasion by other mosses, principally Barbula hornschuchiana Schultz. A substantial proportion of the second year colonies overlapped in position with the first year colonies, particularly in P. cuspidatum. The results are discussed in relation to data on spore dispersal and other aspects of the life-history of these annual or short-lived shuttle mosses.

lindbergia.35.53|Due to their high shoot density and ability to store and transport water externally, ectohydric bryophytes may share water laterally among shoots. Given that rates of evaporation may be spatially variable across the canopy due to structural irregularities that cause surface roughness, lateral water transport via integrated capillary networks may affect shoot water status and influence carbon dynamics.

20149205| The Sphagnum flora of the hot springs in Iceland is mostly associated with alcaline waters and is here often much more richly developed than in other parts of Iceland. Dominant species are S. teres, S. papillosum, S. subnitens, and S. palustre. Of these, only S. teres is dominant in the Sphagnum flora of Iceland as a whole, while S. palustre is exclusive to the springs. Several species associated with the springs can be considered members of an oceanic element. The flora of the individual springs varies, probably due to differences in chemical composition of the water but, overall, the spring flora differs radically from that elsewhere in Iceland.

20149849| Direct and indirect effects of eutrophication on the replacement of the rich-fen bryophyte species Scorpidium scorpioides by Calliergonella cuspidata were studied by cultivation experiments in mono and mixed culture under different nutrient, light and litter conditions. Rates of CO-uptake were measured at different light intensities. Growth in length was stimulated by phosphorus supply in S. scorpioides, whereas C. cuspidata was not affected by N, P or NP. Both species showed reduced growth in mixed culture. Scorpidium scorpioides appeared to be more shade-tolerant and showed increased growth in length in shaded treatments, whereas C. cuspidata was negatively affected by low light conditions. Supply of litter, resulting in increased nutrient availability and, via litter as a "climbing frame", a drier environment, had minor effects on S. scorpioides, but C. cuspidata responded with a strong increase in dry weight. The latter species grew even better in mixed culture. The replacement of S. scorpioides by C. cuspidata is probably not regulated by decreased light availability. Calliergonella cuspidata seems unable to use increased nutrient levels under wet conditions. In a drier environment, possibly reached via a "climbing frame", C. cuspidata may make better used of an increased nutrient availability and outcompete S. scorpioides, but this should be further tested. ///           Scorpidium scorpioides  Calliergonella cuspidata              ,   .

20150210|Bryophytes have several special features, such as haploid gametophytes and the ability to disperse over long distances, which suggest a different spatial partition of neutral genetic variation than in vascular plants. There are, however, only a few nuclear markers for reconstructing infraspecific phylogenies in bryophytes. We designed primers spanning the 2-9 exons and intervening introns of the GapC gene (2550 bp). Our primers were designed to selectively amplify sequences of the genus Sphagnum; however, their degeneracy makes it possible to obtain sequences from other groups of bryophytes. In a pilot study, well-resolved infraspecific phylogenies have been obtained using 10 European Sphagnum fimbriatum Wils. accessions.

20149975|Recent collections and research on Hepaticae in Costa Rica yielded 37 new species records for this country. These include the family Allisoniaceae and the genera Calycularia, Cylindrocolea, Luteolejeunea, Micropterygium, Mytilopsis, Neesioscyphus, Stenorrhipis and Thysananthus new to Costa Rica. Colura verdoornii Herzog & Jovet-Ast is new to tropical America. Twenty additional species are reported as new for Central America. A summary of taxa reported for Costa Rica includes 33 families, 125 genera and 537 species, i.e. about 43% of the species known from tropical America.

20150055|Gametophores of the three Herbertus species occurring in Norway were collected in the field, and fragments of different sizes were produced in the laboratory. These were sown on Petri dishes with nutrient enriched agar and in vials containing nutrient solution. The regeneration from fragments was 10.3% for Herbertus aduncus subsp. hutchinsiae, 26.4% for H. borealis and 5.4% and 0.5% for two different populations of H. stramineus. The three species studied also showed an ability to regenerate from gametophores placed flat on nutrient agar. In general large fragments regenerated better than small fragments. The differences between the species in regeneration ability are in accordance with the species' abundance in the field, and are thought to reflect the local growth rates of the species.
20149770| The original collections of Lophozia jurensis Meyl. ex K. Mll. of Meylan were examined and a lectotype was chosen and illustrated.

20149945|Sphagnum has been studied on Gotland, a 3000 km large island, and one of the most strongly calcareous areas in Sweden. The few habitats suitable for peat mosses are scattered over the whole island, and have resulted in a lot of small and very local occurrences, together totalling only 0.03 km. The growth rate of individual Sphagnum patches has been studied; preliminary results point to a mean growth per occurrence of 3.6 cm radial growth per year, with the two robust species S. palustre and S. squarrosum showing the highest growth rates. The average growth rate corresponds to 15 years to build up 1 m of Sphagnum. Nearly 80% of the Sphagnum occurrences are very small (up to 3 m), suggesting a drastic increase of Sphagnum on Gotland in the last decades. pH (measured directly in Sphagnum) varied between 3.2 and 6.9 and is thus similar to values found for most species in the USA. Three quarters of the Sphagnum localities are found on Forest soils (Eutric Cambisols and Haplic Podzols). These soils, with an acid reaction, cover only a third of Gotland's area. The 250 species of vascular plants, found growing directly in peat mosses, reflect the flora of the surroundings, with some exceptions (e.g. hardly any annual and biennial species).
20149664| The bryophyte flora of Gros Morne National Park consists of 417 species (325 mosses, 92 hepatics). This floristic richness is a reflection of habitat diversity and glacial history. Five regions (based on combinations of geology and physiography) are recognized within the park: Coastal Plain, Acidic Highlands, Mafic Highlands, Ultramafic Highlands, and Calcareous Highlands. The Acidic Highlands have the most diverse flora, although the Calcareous Highlands have almost as many species. The Ultramafic Highlands have the fewest species. Ecological factors, including competition and habitat, may determine the presence of rare otherwise phytogeographically significant bryophytes in the park and, although these factors are considered of importance, they are shown to apply to most bryophytes, whether rare or not. Historical factors help the interpretation of the origin of the Gros Morne flora. The park has a large complement of bryophytes whose distributions suggest that they are glacial relics and survived the Wisconsin Glaciation in or near the sites where they are found today. Several late-Pleistocene ice-free areas occur within what is now the park. These could have served as refugia for bryophytes that now show disjunct distributions and isolated populations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence region. ///       (Gros Morne)   417  (325 , 92 ).          .

20149309|Campylium protensum is closely related to C. stellatum with which it is often confused. It is separated from C. stellatum by its smaller, usually strongly squarrose leaves, dense branching and prostate growth. Its autecology differs strongly from that of C. stellatum and it is found in a broad range of habitats. C. protensum is widely distributed in Norway.
20150242|This study examined the short-term growth responses to a temperature increase in situ of three bryophytes species of different genera. Temperatures were enhanced by the use of open-top chambers at Latnjajaure, a subarctic-alpine site in northernmost Sweden. Growth was measured during the growing season of 1995, using the tied-thread method for Aulacomnium turgidum, the cranked-wire method for Sphagnum teres, and the short-transplanting method for Tomentypnum nitens. Temperature enhancement significantly increased the growth in length of Sphagnum teres while no significant effects were found for the other two species. One possible reason for this is that Sphagnum teres had more water available, while the other two species could not respond to increased temperature due to constraints of water availability.

20149974|Gametophore fragments from two populations of each of the closely related Sphagnum fallax and S. isoviitae were regenerated on agar in axenic culture. Fragments from stem branches and capitulum branches were grown in media with or without additions of glucose and cytokinin in order to find conditions for rapid production of a large number of clonal gametophores. The morphology of the regenerated material was compared with the field collected gametophores. After 5 weeks 62% of the cultures had regenerated. The frequency of fragments regenerating was considerably higher from capitulum branch fragments than stem branch fragments, while cytokinin seemed to hamper both initiation of regeneration and growth of the regenerated material. Addition of glucose caused extensive losses of cultures due to contamination. The regenerated material was distinctly different morphologically from the field collected gametophores in having larger branch leaves and large hemi-isophyllous stem leaves. Gametophores initiated from stem branch fragments had larger stem leaves than those initiated from capitulum branches. Morphological characters varied considerably between cultures of the same genotype, but much less within clonal cultures suggesting that cultures are in different stages of development. The experiment shows that regeneration on agar in axenic culture is an adequate method for fast propagation of clonal material for a diversity of purposes, and suggests ways of optimising this approach.
20149893|Fossil mosses from the late-glacial sediments at Krkenes have been analysed stratigraphically and semi-quantitatively. Most are identified to species level. The representation of terrestrial moss floras in lake sediments and diagenetic processes that hinder fossil moss identification are discussed. Detrended correspondence analysis of the 45 samples and 71 taxa at Krkenes was interpreted with the help of Ellenberg ecological indicator values for temperature, pH, moisture, continentality, and light. The main variation in the data set reflects the species' temperature demands, and follows the major temperature changes in the late-glacial. Comparison with the present-day altitudinal distributions of the species found fossil yields estimates of the late-glacial climate. The modern ecology, the DCA results, and the indicator values are used to reconstruct the range of late-glacial habitats and changes in the moss vegetation. The Allerd was cool and treeless and moss habitats were mainly influenced by snow and frost. The Younger Dryas was colder, a cirque glacier developed in the catchment, and substrata were predominantly unstable and wet. Temperature rose quickly at the opening of the Holocene. Stabilising soils and habitats were dominated by tall ferns and Salix scrub. Birch woodland subsequently developed, with mosses characteristic of open birch-woodlands today in western Norway. This study shows that mosses colonise newly available habitats as rapidly as vascular plants, that fossil mosses provide evidence for microhabitats unobtainable from vascular-plant fossils, and that fossil mosses have made a unique contribution to the reconstruction of the late-glacial and early Holocene vegetation and environment at Krkenes.
20150030|On the basis of geological and archaeological finds the Holocene distribution of Neckera crispa Hedw. in the Netherlands is reconstructed. This moss occurred here 100 000 year ago (Eemian) and later again from the Neolithic (ca 6000 years ago) until recent times. The prehistoric and historic finds suggest that it was more or less common as an epiphyte on deciduous trees in moist forests. The disappearance of this habitat during the past centuries was probably the reason for the decline and disappearence of Neckera crispa. Prehistoric and historic man has used this moss for different purposes, among others the caulking of ships.
20149613| The present checklist is a revision of the first checklist of the mosses of Canada published in 1980. The list is based on verified herbarium specimens and literature reports. The mosses are reported for each of the 10 provinces and two territories, with Labrador and the Arctic Archipelago listed separately. A total of 965 species, 6 subspecies, 101 varieties, and 5 forms in 223 genera and 53 families are recognized for Canada. ///         ,   1980 .          .        ,      .     965 , 6 , 101   5   223   53 .

20149763| The genus Pseudocalliergon (Limpr.) Loeske is revised for northern Europe. The genus is interpreted as consisting of P. angustifolium Hedens, sp. nov., P. lycopodioides (Brid.) Hedens, comb. nov., P. brevifolium (Lindb.) Hedens, comb. nov., P. turgescens (T. Jens.) Loeske and P. trifarium (Web. & Mohr) Loeske. The genus is defined by, i.a., the typical colour and gloss of the species, the structure of the alar cell group, the structure and colour of the axillary hairs and the ecology of the species. All the species grow in lime-rich and, except for P. trifarium, small and often shallow and periodically dry wetland habitats (sometimes the habitats are flushed with lime-rich water). In northern Europe, P. angustifolium grows in the Scandinavian mountain range and in the more eastern areas also in the Northern Boreal zone. P. lycopodioides reaches north to Iceland and S Norway in the west and approximately to the Middle Boreal zone in the east. P. brevifolium occurs only in the arctic areas.

20149505| Timmia Hedw. sect. Timmia is revised on a worldwide scale. The section consists of a single species, T. megapolitana Hedw., with two subspecies. Subsp. megapolitana is distinguished primarily by larger lamina cells and papillae on the dorsal surface of the leaf sheath; subsp. bavarica (Hessl.) Brassard, comb. et stat. nov., has smaller lamina cells, and the leaf sheaths are generally non-papillose. Intermediate populations with small lamina cells and papillose sheaths are assigned to subsp. bavarica. Distribution maps of the two taxa show distinct and only slightly overlapping ranges -- subsp. megapolitana is mainly associated with temperate deciduous forest regions, while subsp. bavarica has a wide-ranging arctic-montane distribution. A lectotype is chosen for Timmia megapolitana. A key is provided for all the species and infraspecific taxa in the genus Timmia. /// Timmia Hedw.

20149752| The concentrations of mineral element in three species of Sphagnum (S. fallax, S. magellanicum and S. capillifolium) as well as in bog-pool water were determined at periodic intervals during the 1989 growing season. Potassium, calcium and heavy metals account for most of the interspecific variation, K being more concentrated in hollow species, Ca as well as heavy metals in hummock species. The concentrations of other elements show a seasonal pattern of variation largely common to all species and therefore reflecting general processes. Sodium, magnesium, and to a certain degree calcium become progressively more concentrated in Sphagnum tissues during the growing season and are leached from cell walls prevalently during the cold months. Nitrogen and to a lesser extent phosphorus are enriched in the chlorophyllose cells during the period of intense growth and are leaked from the cell interior as soon as growth rate becomes slower. Leaching of nutrients is probably determined by an increased permeability of plasmalemma determined by senescence. ///         (S. fallax, S. magellanicum  S. caprillifolium),                 1989 . ,          ,      ,         ,   .       ,       , ,   . , ,                          .                          .        ,  .

20149901| Five species of Rhynchostegiella (Brachytheciaceae) occur in the Canary Islands (Spain): R. trichophylla, R. teneriffae, R. macilenta, R. bourgeana, and R. litorea. Keys and illustrations are provided for the species and their taxonomy is discussed. R. trichophylla is a new species, characterized by: 1 a subulate leaf apex formed by the longly excurrent nerve; 2 median lamina cells 30-60 m long; 3 absence of a central strand; and 4 a smooth seta. R. jacquinii and R. teesdalei are shown to be conspecific and both reduced to synonymy under R. teneriffae. R. bourgeana is accepted as a distinct species, characterized by: 1 ovate-lanceolate concave leaves; 2 a thin nerve which disappears in the upper half of the leaf; 3 median lamina cells 60-90 m long; and 4 quadrate-rectangular alar cells, which form a distinct group. R. litorea and R. tenella can be separated as follows: 1 nerve 1/2-2/3 of length of leaf, spores 14-22 m, seta more or less rough (R. litorea); 2 nerve ending in acumen or shortly excurrent, spores 10-15 m, seta usually smooth (R. tenella).

lindbergia.34.44|Estimating the duration of stages in the life cycle of bryophytes based on repeated censuses of populations is a non-trivial task. A method to estimate the length of the period of primary moult in birds is shown here to be also applicable for mosses, using the stage between the events of loss of the calyptra and operculum loss as an example. The duration of this operculum stage varied considerably among nine Dutch moss species studied. The species formed three clusters, with average duration of this stage of 8, 23 and 101 days.

20150056|The geographical distributions, in the form of mosaic maps, altitudinal ranges, frequencies, and habitats of 29 Sphagnum taxa known to occur in Switzerland are described. The detailed distribution patterns vary among individual taxa depending on their habitat requirements. Sphagnum fimbriatum is confined to lowlands in the north and north-west of the country. Similarly, S. cuspidatum, S. rubellum, S. squarrosum, and S. tenellum are more common north than south of the Alps while the occurrences of S. platyphyllum show a southern tendency. S. capillifolium and S. magellanicum are the most frequent taxa, followed by S. compactum, S. russowii, and S. subsecundum whereas S. molle, S. subfulvum, and S. affine are known from four or fewer localities. Taxa with a narrow vertical range are in general ecologically more restricted than taxa which are widely distributed with respect to altitude. Peat mosses do not occur in the northern, north-western, and southernmost lowlands, nor in the Central Alps due to climatic reasons, and have disappeared from the Plateau mainly because of wetland drainage and fertilization in the course of increasing agricultural intensity. Most Sphagna have probably declined as a consequence of habitat loss and/or degradation, and from a national viewpoint, many taxa are nowadays considered to be threatened in Switzerland.

20149976|Facilitation of later-arriving species by early colonists is one of several mechanisms that together drive the directional changes in species composition observed in primary succession. However, the other 'half' of this interaction -- the effect of the facilitated species on its benefactor -- is often unclear. If this effect is inhibitory, then the overall interaction is contramensalism (+, -). An example of a contramensal interaction is given. This involves the overgrowth of a complex taxonomic assemblage of several 'pioneer' bryophyte species by the liverwort Conocephalum conicum. The former facilitates the latter, as judged by a very highly significant enhancement of C. conicum's growth rate; while C. conicum inhibits (indeed kills) the overgrown pioneer assemblage. The mechanism underlying the facilitatory component of this interaction is not yet clear, but may involve elevation of microclimatic humidity. In contrast, the mechanism of inhibition is readily apparent: tissue death due to virtually complete blockage of light penetration. The directness of the link between small-scale localized interspecific interactions (such as this) and broad-scale community successional change depends on many factors, including the degree of physical disturbance.

20149871| Bryophyte subfossils from the Perpohjola and Trend interstadials (c. 105,000-93,000 and 85,000-75,000 years B.P.) in northernmost Sweden serve as paleoenvironmental indicators. Approximately 100 taxa were found in 97 samples from 17 localities. The samples were analysed by Twinspan and Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) to detect vegetation types and other patterns. Separate analyses of wetland taxa and taxa of drier habitats yielded different Twinspan divisions of the samples and different distribution patterns of the samples along the DCA axes. In both ecological groups there was a prevalence of taxa that are either indifferent to mineral richness or that grow in rather mineral-rich habitats. For the taxa of drier habitats, the moisture gradient and the gradient between more and less stable substrates seem to be important in explaining the observed patterns of species associations. For the wetland species, wetness and nutrient richness (N, P) of the habitat seem to be the most important factors. The deposition environment (classified as kettle holes, Veiki moraines or other environments) seems to have influenced the species composition of drier habitats more than the wetlands. This may reflect that the deposition of the material from the drier habitats is allochtonous and influenced by more environmental factors than the autochtonous deposition of the wetland taxa. The samples of taxa from drier habitats indicate a somewhat more closed bryophyte vegetation during parts of the Perpohjola than during the sampled part of the Trend interstadial. In the wetland samples, species of very wet (often submerged) habitats occurred more often in samples from the southern than from the northern part of the study area, which may reflect either climatic differences or differences in topography or water permeability of the ground at the time of deposition. Several species that are presently arctic or mountainous in northern Europe were found, indicating a colder climate than today and an open environment with few or no large shrubs and trees. Campylopus schimperi Milde and Loeskypnum wickesii (Grout) Tuom., indicate that the climate was comparatively oceanic during at least parts of the interstadial periods, whereas the occurrences of Hamatocaulis vernicosus (Mitt.) Hedens and Helodium blandowii (Web. & Mohr) Warnst. may indicate the opposite. ///         (. 105,000 - 93,000  85,000 - 75,000   )       .  1000     97   17 .

20149963|The new IUCN threat categories include many numerical thresholds that require quantitative data. Since such data are rare for bryophytes, the evaluation against the threat categories must often be done by inference from the available data. The most relevant data that can be used for bryophytes are population decline, present distribution and total population size, number of sites, and estimated loss of relevant habitats over the last 10 years or three generations. For assessing species at a regional level, evidence of an inflow of propagules from outside the Red List region is discussed. The use of the terms 'individual', 'fragmentation', 'location' and 'generation time' is also discussed.
20150143|We present a protocol for the use of inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) in bryophytes. The method was developed recently and is now being used on bryophytes. ISSR is a PCR-based method and includes the amplification of DNA fragments by relatively short primers (ca 10-30 bp), which attach to the template simple sequence repeats (SSR) regions. The advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed and the method is compared with other molecular methods used in bryophyte population genetics including isozymes, RAPD, AFLP and RFLP. We further discuss how to optimize the PCR and the repeatability of ISSR.
20149626| Seasonal dynamics of net photosynthetic activity, growth and chlorophyll content of the peat moss Sphagnum papillosum Lindb. has been studied in a raised bog near Ljubljana (Slovenia, Yugoslavia). Generally, no correlations were recorded between the annual course of net photosynthesis and the growth dynamics. Maximum values of net photosynthesis were achieved in August (1.95 mg CO g h), when the rate of biomass accumulation decreased. At the beginning of the growing season, growth in dry weight was intensive. During the winter months photosynthetic activity declined and in February it was completely interrupted. Chlorophyll content varied markedly during the sampling period. Chlorophyll content was positively correlated with net photosynthesis, but not with growth.

20149762| All observed capsules of Bryowijkia ambigua (Hook.) Noguchi, contain small unicellular spores (38-58 m) that are aborted, and large multicellular spores (145-180 m) that are presumably viable. Regardless of maturation stage of a capsule or geographical origin, spore size variation within a capsule follows a consistent bimodal pattern. The two types of spores are in a constant 1:1 ratio, with about 230-250 spores of each type per capsule. This ratio is established early in spore development, after a phase of granule deposition. In each tetrad, two spores abort while still unicellular and the other two spores remain viable and become multicellular. These observations suggest that the spore mass in Bryowijkia ambigua represents a very unusual instance of false anisospory, since it involves unicellular and multicellular spores.

20149997|Orthotrichum laxum Lewinsky-Haapasaari sp. nov. (subg. Pulchella (Schimp.) Vitt sect. Diaphana Vent.) is described from the Qinghai province, China. It is an epiphytic moss growing in loose tufts on Salix and can be distinguished by emergent, strongly plicate, dry capsules, with stomata hardly covered by subsidiary cells and double peristomes of 8 teeth and 8 stout, biseriate segments united by a connecting membrane. The vaginula is naked and the calyptra slightly plicate with a few scattered hairs.

20149698| Enzyme electrophoresis was used to estimate genetic variation in R. strumiferum, R. tomentosum, R. intermedium and R. capense. Eight enzyme systems, representing 10 loci, were used. Three loci showed double bands in the monoicous R. tomentosum, while the other, dioicous, species produced only single bands for these loci. Chromosome counts showed that the double banding pattern in R. tomentosum coincided with a double number of chromosomes (n = 20, versus n = 10 in R. strumiferum and R. capense). The finding of both heterozygotes and homozygotes for Pgm-2 and Got suggests that autodiploidy is the most likely origin of R. tomentosum. The mean gene diversity within populations of the four Racopilum species ranged from 0.06-0.21, which is a moderate to high level of genetic variation compared with phanerogams. Between populations of different species the genetic distances were generally much larger than between populations within each species. In view of its very distinct sporophyte, R. intermedium might be ranked as a separate genus. The electrophoretic data, however, do not support this view and show a close genetic relationship with R. tomentosum and R. capense.

20149305|Notes on the distribution, ecology and variability of the species of Andreaea, Archidium, Ditrichum and Ceratodon in the Netherlands, following a revision of the herbarium collections. Ditrichum lineare appeared to be more widespread as was formerly understood. It often grows as scattered small sterile shoots among other species of Ditrichum and is restricted to loamy soils. Numerous new localities of Ditrichum cylindricum, which was only recently discovered, show that it is frequent in parts of our country where loamy or rich sandy soils prevail. The average size of Ditrichum flexicaule-plants collected in the last century is almost twice as large as those of plants collected from 1900 onwards. Growing conditions for this species apparently are no longer favourable. Ceratodon purpureus var. conicus has been erronously recorded. The only characteristic feature of the type material is the long excurrent nerve; the broad leaves and the erect capsules are also regularly present with forms of var. purpureus. Other renowned characteristics of var. conicus are absent from the type material. Starved forms of C. purpureus often bear bundles of gemmiferous threads in the leaf axils; this way of vegetative propagation may be important for its local distribution.
20149837| The occurrence of nematode galls is reported on an Indian liverwort Cheilolejeunea cf. giraldiana (Mass.) Mizut. Interestingly, the presence of the nematode induces some morphological changes in the leaves which form the gall at the shoot apex. The normal vegetative leaves have distinct lobes and lobules and the margin of the leaf is entire. Gall-forming leaves are not differentiated into lobes and lobules and the margin is either smooth or with 1-3 (5)-celled projections in the outer whorl and inner whorl, respectively. ///        Cheilolejeunea cp.giraldiana (Mass.)

20150205|Bryophyte community ecology has played a central role in developing our understanding of how bryophyte species are arranged within plant communities, however it has largely been descriptive in nature. Other aspects of bryophyte communities that deserve our attention are more dynamic, and include the origin, assembly, change, and probable future of bryophyte guilds. In this essay, I review five topics that illustrate important advances in our understanding of complex species patterns. 1) Changes in the occurrence and extent of communities in response to climatic change; 2) sources of diaspores for bryophyte community establishment; 3) persistence of bryophyte assemblages; 4) importance of habitats to species occurrence and the coarse filter approach; and 5) quantification of bryophyte niches. All of the papers reviewed here use aspects of community ecology to help resolve broad scale questions by going beyond just description. These papers represent the beginnings of the next generation of community ecology and seek answers to why patterns occur and how these patterns relate to both population and ecosystem processes.

20149731| Yearly growth between 1987-90 of Racomitrium microcarpon (Hedw.) Brid. growing on exposed, dry, granite rock ledges in northwestern Ontario, Canada is estimated to range between 2.3 and 3.1 mm yr. Significant variation in yearly growth could not be demonstrated within colonies. Growth differences between colonies were significant. Growth during 1989-90 was highly significantly different than that from the previous two years. These yearly growth differences appear to be related to relatively high precipitation during the four month growing season, resulting in less aridity and to increased local runoff from high rainfall events. Relative humidity and temperature are less important. Mean age of the colonies is 35 yr, however the current colonies are secondary, arising from earlier colonization events of 70-75 yr ago in a forest about 110 yr in age. /// ,     1987-1990.

20149786| A scanning electron microscope study was made of the spores of the seven species of Herzogiella: H. adscendens, H. cylindricarpa, H. perrobusta, H. renitens, H. seligeri, H. striatella, and H. turfacea. All species possess the gemmate type of spore ornamentation. In addition, the verrucate type of spore ornamentation occurs in two species, H. cylindricarpa and H. striatella, where it is more common than the gemmate type. The close similarity in the ornamentation of the spores of these two species may indicate that they are more closely related to one another than to the other species.

20149342|The dutch herbarium specimens of Dicranum Hedw. sect. Dicranum have been revised. A short diagnosis of the section and a key to its species and varieties is given. Notes are given on the distribution, ecology and variability of the taxa. For nearly all taxa a decline in frequency, fertility and vitality is reported. The mean stem length of specimens collected in the 20th century is 2 cm less than that of specimens collected in the 19th century for all species except D. polysetum Sw. Special attention has been paid to the delimitation of D. bonjeanii De Not. versus D. scoparium Hedw. and D. polysetum Sw. Within D. scoparium Hedw. three infraspecific taxa have been recognised, i.e. var. scoparium, var. alpestre Hueb. and var. curvulum Brid; the formerly recognised var. paludosum Schimp. is considered to be a modification (phenotypic expression of environmental variation) of var. scoparium.
20149506| The most important physiological adaptations of aquatic mosses are those permitting growth and survival at low light, and survival in a hydrated state at high temperatures. Low light adaptations seem to result in a shift in pigment ratio and a low light compensation point, coupled with growth in cold water. The ability to shift both compensation point and optimum with a shift in seasons is an important mechanism for surviving and growing in a hydrated state when terrestrial mosses are able to go dormant. Life cycle strategies take advantage of low, quiet water for fertilization, cool water and high light for growth, and moving water or emergence for dispersal. Several expected adaptations are missing. Chlorophyll does not increase with depth. Only CO and not bicarbonates are used in photosynthesis. Aquatic mosses lack the ability to increase photosynthesis over photorespiration when they are hydrated at temperatures above 20C; thus true aquatic mosses are virtually absent in the tropics. ///     -  ,                .    , -,             ,      .                      ,       .     ,    ,       ,       .    .      .

The near absence of a costa in Fontinalis is considered the result of the suppression of a multistratose structure in the leaves.

20149514| The environmental gradients of most importance to mosses of aquatic habitats are water flow and water level fluctuation. Species that obtain their maximum development in stagnant water are limnophilous species, while those whose optimum development is in flowing water are rheophilous species. Obligate aquatic species have little or no tolerance or adaptation to drought conditions, while facultative aquatic species are tolerant of some degree of desiccation and xerophytic conditions. The semi-aquatic emergent habitat is one where adaptations are present that provide water for the terrestrially exposed growing portions from a hydrophytically disposed lower portion. Gametophytic adaptations to these habitats are not necessarily paralleled by sporophyte adaptations. Many species having aquatically adapted gametophytes have terrestrially adapted sporophytes. Other highly adapted limnophilous or slightly rheophilous taxa such as Fontinalis have highly aquatically adapted sporophyte features, including peristomial adaptations. The highly derived character states of aquatic mosses suggest that these plants have evolved from terrestrial ancestors. The wide diversity of phylogenetically unrelated families indicates that mosses have adapted to the aquatic environment in numerous independent lineages, and that character states these taxa have in common are the result of parallel evolution to a highly specialized habitat. The distribution of aquatic mosses is world-wide; however, observations of distribution patterns of aquatic taxa and abundance patterns of these mosses suggest that the aquatic mosses are more common in temperate than in tropical areas. ///               . ,      ,   ,     ,      ,   .              ,                .     ,   ,   ,         .           .  ,    ,    .        ,   Fontinalis,      ,   .        ,       .        ,          ,    ,    ,          .     , -       ,        ,        ,    . 
20149204| The taxonomy and karyology of the species of Cinclidium Sw. have been studied. It is concluded, that the genus comprises 4 species, viz. C. arcticum (B.S.G.) Schimp., C. stygium Sw., C. latifolium Lindb. and C. subrotundum Lindb. Infraspecific taxa have not been recognized. Sexuality, border of leaves, leaf point, flat shape of leaves, stereometry of leaves, pattern of areolation of lamina, and shape of the capsule are considered to provide good taxonomical characters. Description of the genus and the species are given with short remarks on their geographical distributions. Chromosome number of C. arcticum and C. latifolium are given for the first time, n = 7. The previous reported chromosome number of C. stygium and C. subrotundum, n = 14, are verified. The basic number for the genus is x = 7 (6+1 m), found in dioecious species only. Synoecious species are polyploid in terms of the gametophyte, n = 2x = 14. The karyological study justifies, that sexuality is an important specific character and also the conclusions in the taxonomic part. ///      Cinclidium Sw. ,    4 ,   C. arcticum (B.S.G.)

20149678| The dominant species of liverworts and mosses in eighteen diverse habitats of the Nainital hills (NW Himalaya) were studied for net production and standing crop. Maximal annual net production and mean annual biomass were found for Hymenostylium recurvirostrum of boundary walls. There was striking inter-spcies and intraspecies variation in biomass which appeared to be mainly under the control of climatic conditions in the natural habitat. ///            , - ,        .

20149365|The combination Cnestrum alpestre (Hb.) Nyholm ex Mogensen is proposed to validate this name within the genus Cnestrum Hag. Wahlenberg's material of Dicranum alpestre Wahlenb. consists of Cnestrum alpestre, Cnestrum glaucescens (Lindb. et Arn.) Mogensen et Steere, and Cynodontium tenellum Limpr. This explains the considerable taxonomic and nomenclatural confusion previously existing between the taxa now treated under the names Cnestrum alpestre and Cynodontium tenellum Limpr.

20149814| The influence of light (small gaps vs shade), microsite (dry ridge vs wet ravine) and species of understory shrub (Hybanthus prunifolius vs Psychotria horizontalis) on a lowland tropical epiphyllous hepatic community were examined in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Epiphyll community structure and composition were strongly influenced by light and microsite but not by species of understory shrub. Epiphylls grew poorly in shaded environments and the dominance of species shifted in response to relatively small differences in moisture regime. The epiphyll Aphanolejeunea sicaefolia dominated in the dry microsite, but was relatively rare in the wet microsite, whereas the epiphyll Leptolejeunea elliptica dominated in the wet microsite and was relatively rare in the dry microsite. When growing in the same microsite, both species of shrub had similar epiphyll communities. These results suggest that epiphyllous hepatic community structure and composition are influenced by the patchy mosaic structure of tropical rainforests. ///    , ,    (    ),  (    )     (Hybanthus   Psychotria horizontalis)   ,   .            ,       .                   .

20149946|I examined various features of the demography and morphology of Polytrichastrum formosum from three spruce forest sites in southern and central Norway. At each site samples were taken from both boulders and soil, and from three positions within each turf. Each sample consisted of the P. formosum shoots found within a 1010-cm plot. Shoots from each plot were analysed in the laboratory with respect to leaf and capsule morphology, annual growth, shoot density, fecundity, and survival. Strong differences in morphology and annual growth were found, especially between the two geographical regions. The shoots and leaves from central Norway were larger than those from southern Norway. In southern Norway, there was a higher density of living and dead shoots, and they were more fertile. In southern Norway, shoot growth decreased in older shoots, whereas in central Norway shoot growth increased in older shoots.
20150058|Bryophytes found on cultivated ground in Qubec and Slovakia are listed. Bryum demaretianum and Dicranella staphylina are reported new for North America north of Mexico and B. demaretianum new for Slovakia. There are considerable similarities in the bryophyte floras of arable fields in the two areas. All the fields examined appear to have non-calcareous soils.
20149463| In the top soil of two Dutch chalk grasslands a large reservoir of, probably chiefly vegetative, diaspores is present. From soil samples 37 species of bryophytes emerged, all of which have also been found above-ground recently or some years ago. The fern gametophytes emerging, however, originate from spores from elsewhere. In the above-ground vegetation, Perennials (pleurocarps and hepatics) dominate, but in the soil acrocarps, especially Colonists are more frequent. Below-ground diversity is high, with a mean of ca. 8 species in a 5 cm soil core. Seasonal variation in the diaspore bank is low for most bryophytes; the ferns show a peak in winter. It is suggested, that especially the vegetative diaspores are long-lived in the soil. ///             ,    .     37  ,      .    , ,    .

20150244| Sphagnum tescorum Flatberg (sect. Acutifolia) is described as a new species from subarctic Alaska. It can be recognized in the field by its brownish capitula with long, rather straight and suberect outer branches that rise above the inner part level of the capitulum when viewed from the sides, a distinct terminal bud, a predominantly greenish stem with pale brownish portions, and branch fascicles of usually two divergent and one pendent branch. Under a microscope, it is foremost recognized by the lingulate-spathulate stem leaves usually widest just below their distal end, a broadly fimbriate-truncate apex and sparse fimbriation along the lateral margins, and by a multiporose outer stem cortex. The new species is diploid and dioecious. The spores are large with a diameter of approximately 33 m. From morphological comparisons with related species, it is proposed that the new species is an allodiploid with S. girgensohnii and S. fimbriatum as the most likely parents. Material from Alaska, and the Chukotka area in eastern Russia has been examined for this determination. This indicates an amphi-Beringian species distribution. The species' preferred habitat seems to be lawns and hummocks in more or less topogenous, poor to intermediate tundra mires. 
20149732| Samples of aquatic bryophytes were collected from 170 sites in 32 rivers in Galicia (N.W. Spain). The mosses Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw., Brachythecium rivulare Schimp., Fissidens polyphyllus Wils., Rhynchostegium riparioides (Hedw.) Card., and the liverwort Scapania undulata (L.) Dum. were studied. These aquatic bryophytes showed higher chlorophyll concentrations than some terrestrial bryophytes. Stress rates, due to organic and metal pollution, were characterized on the basis of the chlorophyll contents and pigment ratios. D665/665a ratio provided the best results. The most resistant species to pollution was Fontinalis antipyretica whereas Scapania undulata was the most sensitive. We include a discussion of the use of pigment ratios in aquatic bryophytes in monitoring water quality. ///      170   32    (- ).

20149832| Electrophoretic data from 35 natural populations show that Plagiomnium curvatulum Wyatt & Stoneburner comb. nov. is an allopolyploid, with fixed heterozygosity in about one-third of the 17 loci surveyed. One of the progenitors of P. curvatulum is the haploid P. ellipticum. Among extant species of Plagiomnium section Rosulata, the European endemic P. elatum comes closest to matching the genetic profile of the other haploid progenitor. It appears likely that major changes in the gene pool of P. elatum occurred in association with Pleistocene glaciation in Europe, and losses of certain alleles may have obscured the relationship of this species to P. curvatulum. Alternatively, an ancestor of P. elatum (and possibly also the other European endemic, P. affine) may have been involved in the interspecific hybridizations that launched P. curvatulum as an allopolyploid species. In contrast to P. medium, which is a very recent derivative of P. insigne  P. ellipticum, P. curvatulum may be of more ancient derivation. In any event, the taxonomic implications of these findings are clear: P. curvatulum should not be treated as a subspecies of P. medium, but rather as a distinct species. Taxonomic confusion has resulted from the fact that both species have one parent in common (P. ellipticum) and overemphasis of the fact that both are bisexual. ///  ,   35   ,  Plagiomnium curvatulum Wyatt & Stoneburner . .           17  .

20150045|Thirty-one species of the Estonian bryoflora belong to the Red Data Book of European Bryophytes. Eight of these are not threatened in Estonia and do not belong to the Red Data Book of Estonia. Five European endemic species occur in Estonia. Five species are included in Appendix I of the Bern Convention; of these Dichelyma capillaceum and Dicranum viride are the most threatened in Estonia.

20150235|The highly disjunct moss Didymodon maschalogenus (Renauld & Cardot) Broth. is reported new to Europe from three high montane valleys of the Hohe Tauern Mts., Eastern Alps, Austria, and two localities in northwestern Telemark, Norway. Perigonia and perichaetia are described for the first time in this species. Minor morphological differences between the Austrian and Norwegian plants are interpreted as a case of sexual dimorphism. Based on type specimens, problematical nomenclature is also treated. Didymodon hastatus (Mitt.) R. H. Zander is not considered a synonym. In the Alps, D. maschalogenus proved to be a stenoecious species, restricted as an early pioneer to moist, crumbling rocks of calcareous schist in the montane and subalpine belt.
