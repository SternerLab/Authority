10.2307/3535474|A single egg was collected at 62 nests of 10 seabird species from Oregon in 1979. The eggs were analyzed for organochlorine contaminants; contemporary shell thickness was compared with eggshells collected during earlier time periods. Concentrations of DDE and PCB's in 1979 were generally low with the most contaminated species being the Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), Leach's Storm Petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa), and Forktailed Storm Petrel (O. furcata). Limited eggshell data provide evidence that shell thinning was more severe along the Oregon coast in the 1950's than in 1979. With the possible exception of the Fork-tailed Storm Petrel, the residues in 1979 posed no known threat to the welfare of the species.
10.2307/3534688|About one-quarter of the resident seabirds in the Gulf of Alaska breed on the Semidi Islands. In terms of biomass, the proportion is closer to one-third. The most abundant birds are Common and Thick-billed Murres, with a combined population exceeding 1 million birds. Hundreds of thousands of Horned Puffins breed in burrows on two islands. Other species numbering more than 100,000 individuals include the Northern Fulmar, Fork-tailed and Leach's Storm-Petrels, and possibly also the Black-legged Kittiwake and Tufted Puffin. Both species of storm-petrels commonly nest in side chambers of puffin burrows. Parasitic Jaegers nest in a loose colony on Chowiet Island. This behavior has not been reported elsewhere in the Gulf of Alaska. Red-faced and Pelagic Cormorants commonly change breeding colony location from year to year. The Semidi Islands are the easternmost breeding site for Least Auklets.
10.2307/3535288|Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) distribution and relative abundance along the Oregon coast were studied during the summers of 1977-1980. Shore-based observations along the entire Oregon coast were made in 1977. In 1978-1980, detailed studies of whale distribution, activities, and body size were made along the central coast only; they were supplemented with observations from aircraft. Over 1200 summer sightings were made within 0.5 km of shore. Numbers of sightings varied considerably from day to day and from year to year, with whale abundance estimated at 0.2-0.3 whales/km of shoreline for a 100 km portion of the study area. Over one-half the whales were presumed to be feeding; the remainder were traveling, usually parallel to shore. Body length was determined for 42 whales photogrammetrically. The majority of these summer whales were evidently subadults; calves and yearlings accounted for approximately 50% of the total.
10.2307/3535458|The Sage Sparrow (Amphispiza belli) breeds in flat sagebrush steppe (Artemisia spp.) habitat in southern Idaho where sharp temperature gradients and wind occur almost daily. These environmental conditions and the species' large territories may place selective pressure on song structure for transmission and locatability. Based on predictions from experimental studies on sound transmission by others, it appeared that Sage Sparrow song is especially well suited to distance transmission because of its low frequencies, broad-band spectra, rapid frequency modulation, and tendency for lower-frequency syllables to be longer. Localization cues were provided by abrupt beginnings and endings of syllables, short durations, low pitches, and broad-band spectra. Syllable type sequences involved at least first order Markov chains. Only a fraction of the number of two-syllable sequences possible was observed and they occurred more often in one order than in the reverse. Contrast between successive syllable types within songs was expressed by a lack of syllable-type repetition and alternation and a tendency to alternate high and low frequency syllable types and long and short types. Species identity is probably encoded in song-frequency patterns and syllable morphology while population identity is probably encoded in syllable type sequences and temporal parameters.
10.2307/3535529|The relationship between size, caloric content, and association of prey fishes in meals that adult Rhinoceros Auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) carry to their nestlings was studied on Pine and Triangle Islands, British Columbia from 1977 to 1979. Rhinoceros Auklets carried wide fishes widthwise in their bills and slender fishes by their height or width. The number of fish carried per trip was inversely related to their size. The longest fishes made up the largest meals in biomass and provided most energy to the nestlings. Four large species, Pacific saury (Cololabis saira), second-year Pacific herring (Clupea harengus), second-year Pacific sandlance (Ammodytes hexapterus), and bluethroat argentine (Nansenia candida), were negatively associated with other prey fishes. Small fishes of different species were positively associated with one another in meals, as well as certain small fishes with larger ones, but not vice versa. By complementing small fishes of one species with fishes of other species, foraging Rhinoceros Auklets boosted the energy content of a meal. Total food consumption of nestling Rhinoceros Auklets in the northeastern Pacific was estimated at 326 metric tons or 1.7 billion kcal per nesting season. Comparison of caloric intake among nestling Rhinoceros Auklets, Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), and Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) revealed that smaller alcids take in more calories per gram body weight than larger ones.
10.2307/3535530|Bird populations occupying two narrow, linear riparian zones in Montana were studied in 1968 and 1980. The two areas differed in several vegetative parameters such as vertical layering, riparian width, and canopy cover. Bird densities ranged from 355 to 475 pairs per 40 ha. Riparian width, height of vegetation layers 1 and 2, and cover in layer 2 were the most significant variables in male territory location for some bird species. Some species such as the Winter Wren and American Redstart were absent in 1980 from one study area, whereas the populations of most other species were similar between years.
10.2307/3534204|A population of Long-eared Owls (Asio otus) nesting in a juniper/sagebrush ecotone had an average density of one pair per 0.65 km<sup>2</sup> and fledged an average of 3.7 young per nest. All 24 nests were built by corvids and were located in juniper trees. Mammals comprised 95.2% of 1000 prey remains collected. The proportion of Heteromyidae and Cricetidae taken as prey by Long-eared Owls was significantly different ( <sup>2</sup>=27.2, 3 df, p < 0.005) from the small mammal composition of the area. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and pocket mice (Perognathus parvus) occurred in the same relative frequencies in pellets and in trapping studies, while kangaroo rats occurred twice as often in pellets as in traps and harvest mice occurred less than half as frequently in pellets as in traps.
10.2307/3534041|Pellets of three owl species were analyzed. Dietary percentages and prey species diversity shows that the Great Horned Owl had the most varied winter diet; however, its summer diet was mainly rabbits and hares. The long-eared Owl fed primarily on pocket mice throughout the year (58.2% of its total diet). The deer mouse ranked second on a yearly basis, but was much less significant during the summer. The winter diet of the Short-eared Owl was principally pocket mice, followed closely by deer mice; during the summer, the pocket gopher was most important, the pocket mouse second, and the deer mouse ranked only sixth.
10.2307/3535044|We discuss the historical status of 25 bird species known or suspected to have bred on St. Lazaria Island, Alaska. Population estimates for breeding birds in 1981-1982 are compared with records extending back more than 80 years. Seabirds, with an estimated total of 560,000 birds, made up the largest component of the breeding avifauna. Storm-petrels totaled 540,000 birds of which 53% were Leach's Storm-Petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) and 47% were Fork-tailed Storm-Petrels (O. furcata). Total burrow occupancy rate for storm-petrels was 74%. Common Murre (Uria aalge) numbers increased substantially from an estimated 600 in 1912 to an estimated 3100 birds in 1981. Thick-billed Murres (U. lomvia) and Brandt's Cormorants (Phalacrocorax penicillatus) are new additions to the island's avifauna. Pigeon Guillemots (Cepphus columba) and Horned Puffins (Fratercula corniculata) have apparently declined since the early 1900's. Population estimates are provided for eight species of breeding terrestrial birds.
10.2307/3534879|A total of 203 Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus) was captured and banded on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Oregon in the fall of 1961 and spring and fall of 1962, and 190 of them were dyed yellow. Subsequently, 380 sightings of dyed swans were received from six western states and five Canadian provinces. Fall migration corridors from Malheur NWR were southwest through northern California, terminating in the Central Valley. The primary wintering area was Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta west of Stockton, California. The primary areas where dyed swans were observed during spring migration were northern Idaho, western Montana, and central Alberta. Additional spring observations occurred in central British Columbia, the Willamette Valley of western Oregon, and eastern Idaho. Dyed birds were observed on known Tundra Swan nesting areas in both western Alaska and the MacKenzie River Delta, Northwest Territories.
10.2307/3535473|A study of the breeding ecology of Parakeet (Cyclorrhynchus psittacula), Crested (Aethia cristatella), and Least (A. pusilla) auklets on St. Lawrence Island, Bering Sea, revealed a variable amount of egg and nestling predation by voles (Microtus and/or Clethrionomys). In the Parakeet Auklet, in 1967, 3.2% of the eggs laid and 20.0% of the nestlings that hatched were depredated by voles. Egg predation in the Crested Auklet varied from 1.9% (1966) to 3.4% (1967), while in the Least Auklet it was 6.0% in 1966 and 3.4% in 1967. Nestling depredation in the Crested Auklet was 5.3% in 1966 and 1967 and 1.0% in 1966 and 0.3% in 1967 in the Least Auklet. Damage to young auklets of nearly fledging age due to chewing by voles is described. The nature of the vole-auklet interactions is described, and the impact of vole damage and predation on auklet productivity is assessed.
10.2307/3533826|The Osprey nesting population was monitored in the Flathead Valley between 1977 and 1980 by initiating data collection for the lower Flat-head River and continuing surveys on Flathead Lake. Results indicate a 'healthy' population with an average of 2.25 young per successful nest (2.18 young per active nest) on the lower Flathead River between 1978 and 1980, an average of 1.94 young per successful nest on the south half of Flathead Lake in 1979 and 1980, and 2.48 young per successful nest in the North Valley in 1979. The Flathead Valley, as a whole, produced 2.24 fledglings per successful nest. These data and other observations indicate a continuing upward trend in the Osprey population. The lower breeding rate for Ospreys nesting on Flathead Lake compared with those along the river may be due to the lake's oligotrophic nature and the longer time the birds spend traveling between fishing and nest sites.
10.2307/3535689|The contents of 86 Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) stomachs from Nizki and Alaid Islands and 193 scats from Kagalaska Island, Aleutian Islands, Alaska, were analyzed and compared. Seabirds, mostly cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.), were the most common prey items (48.7% frequency) in the Nizki-Alaid samples. Insects (28.2% frequency), sea lion carrion (17.9%), amphipods (16.6%), fish (15.4%), intertidal invertebrates (9.0%), and rats (2.6%) were also found. Amphipods occurred in 63.7% of the Kagalaska samples. Small shorebirds and passerines, sea urchins, insects, isopods, rats, and fish were found in 37.8, 33.7, 12.4, 11.4, 7.2, and 6.7%, respectively, of the scats. Vegetation was present in 65% of the stomachs and 60% of the scats. The diets reflect local prey availability. The year around abundance of the intertidal food resources appears to buffer the foxes against winter starvation and may help to sustain high predation pressure on nesting birds during the spring and summer.
10.2307/3535266|Ten waterbird species were censused in Yaquina Estuary, Oregon for two or more years. No species maintained constant population numbers in any year, and most varied markedly in seasonal abundance. Red-throated Loons (Gavia stellata), Common Loons (G. immer), Horned Grebes (Podiceps auritus), Western Grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis), Brant (Branta bernicla), and Red-breasted Mergansers (Mergus serrator) had seasonal peaks in January-April. Common Murres (Uria aalge) and Pigeon Guillemots (Cepphus columba) had peaks in June-August. Common Loons, Horned Grebes, Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), and Great Egrets (Casmerodius albus) had peaks in September-November. Species were not uniformly distributed throughout the Estuary. Most were concentrated at the Estuary mouth rather than in embayments or the upper Estuary during periods of peak abundance. Exact magnitude of large (e.g., 50%) yearly variations in seasonal peak populations of some species at Yaquina Estuary could not be accurately determined because of within-year and daily variation in bird numbers and difficulties in precisely censusing some diving birds.
10.2307/3536435|Diving ducks comprise about one-third of the total January population of waterfowl in Northeastern Puget Sound. They furnish, however, less than four percent of the annual waterfowl harvest. Scoters, scaups, buffleheads, and goldeneyes totalled 97 percent of the 1958-64 January diving duck aerial sampling counts which we tallied at an average of nearly 66,000 birds. Scaups, goldeneyes, and buffleheads constituted about 80 percent of the average annual bag of 5,800 diving ducks during the 1951-59 period.
10.2307/3534256|The abundance and distribution of the Pacific harbor seal (Phoco vitulina richardi) and the northern or Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubata) in Oregon were described. Periodic surveys conducted between June 1967, and June 1968, revealed about 1,000 sea lions and not more than 500 harbor seals. Most seals were found on offshore islands at Simpson Reef, Hunter's Island, Rogue River Reef and Gull Rock. Breeding colonies of sea lions were found at Orford Reef and at Sea Lion Caves. Populations of harbor seals appeared to declining, but numbers of northern sea lions were approximately equal to numbers reported in 1953.
10.2307/3533764|Fifteen replacement male Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) exposed to 17 nests containing unrelated eggs or young showed no evidence of infanticide. I expected these replacement males to kill the dependent offspring of their new mates, thereby forcing the females to renest and giving the replacement males an opportunity to sire offspring of their own. Rather than harming the offspring of their newly acquired mates, replacements exhibited behaviors typical of paternal males. For birds, the limited comparative data support the view that when replacement mates adopt their new consorts' unrelated young, they do so for future benefits.
10.2307/3536436| Measurements were taken of weight, culmen length, and tarsus length on 7 male and 5 female captive-reared Great Basin Canada geese (Branta canadensis moffitti Aldrich) representing 3 distinct geographical populations. Rates of weight-increase were highest at the age of 4 to 6 weeks and declined markedly after 8 weeks. The maximum culmen growth occurred during the second and third weeks of life and was essentially completed by the tenth week. The greatest tarsus growth was during the first 4 weeks of life and complete by the seventh week. 
10.2307/3535289|Whole weights are given for 13 female Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti). The animals were collected in the months of February through May and were mostly in fair to poor physical condition. Nine adult females had a mean kidney fat index of 26% (range = 2-71%), mean whole weight of 261 kg (range = 227-298 kg), mean hog-dressed percent of whole weight of 70.4 (range = 66.2-74.5), and mean fully dressed percent of whole weight of 55.7 (range = 50.1-59.7). The mean whole weight was greater than mean whole weights of adult female C. e. roosevelti in California, adult female Rocky Mountain elk (C. e. nelsoni), and Manitoba elk (C. e. manitobensis). Animals in fair to good physical condition had higher carcass yields than those in poor physical condition. Standard body measurements of 22 Vancouver Island elk of both sexes differed little from measurements from other populations of C. e. roosevelti or the subspecies nelsoni or manitobensis.
10.2307/3534114|Small mammals were trapped in riparian zones in young, mature, and old-growth coniferous forests during spring and summer of 1983. Peromyscus maniculatus was the most abundant species and comprised 76% and 83% of the total captures during spring and summer, respectively. More species, but fewer individuals, were captured on the streamside transects in comparison to the riparian fringe transects, which were 15-20 m from the stream. Six species of Insectivora, including five species of Sorex, were captured in these riparian zones. No species was solely dependent on riparian zones in old-growth forests; however, additional studies are needed to define the specific habitat requirements of Sorex bendirii, Sorex palustris, Neurotrichus gibbsii, Phenacomys albipes, and Microtus richardsoni.
10.2307/3535844|Canada Geese (Branta canadensis moffitti) broods utilized mudflats associated with the Thompson Falls Reservoir in Montana that were exposed at a 1.2 m drawdown and covered with smartweed (Polygonum spp.). The installation of radial gates in mid-1982 changed reservoir operation and eliminated the mudflats. A brood-rearing pasture was planted in 1983 to replace the lost habitat, and its effectiveness evaluated. Following the inundation of the mudflats and the subsequent replacement of new brood-rearing habitat, the percentage of goslings that fledged successfully ranged from 44 to 96. Nesting success from 1983 to 1986 averaged 75.8%, and the number of successful nests located each year did not vary significantly. Nonetheless, the number of goslings observed each year on the reservoir had an inverse relationship with variations in pool elevation.
10.2307/3535690|Only one to two adult Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) (probably a pair that nested nearby) were observed at Yaquina Estuary, Oregon from October to March. Eagles spent most of their time at feeding areas perched in old-growth conifers near water. Fish and birds comprised about equal portions of the eagles' prey; almost all the fish appeared to be stolen from Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) or gulls (Larus spp.). The response of American Coots (Fulica americana) to an eagle's attack was unique in that coots formed a cohesive flock with much distractive behavior when an approaching eagle was farther than about 25 m away. When an eagle approached more closely, the flock disintegrated into an aggregate of coots, each clamoring to escape.
10.2307/3535472|We surveyed a 72 km section on the Columbia River to determine species composition and habitat selection of the nesting raptor population. A total of 87 pairs of 12 species were located during the 1975 nesting season including five species of owls, six species of diurnal raptors, and the Common Raven. Most common components of the raptor community were American Kestrels, Great Horned Owls, and Red-tailed Hawks. Raptor nesting densities averaged 1.21 pairs per linear km of river. Occurrence of nesting raptors was primarily a function of available cliff and riverine woodland habitats. Perchsite selection suggests that several raptor species extend their activity into adjacent shrub-steppe and cultivated field habitats.
10.2307/3534086|A food analysis was made from the gizzard contents of 262 Oregon juncos (Junco oreganus) collected in western Oregon from 1954 through 1962. The average annual diet was about half seed and half insect material. Juncos ate the seeds of many plants and also some germinants (sprouting seeds, and seedlings with seed coat on the cotyledons); those of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), blackberry and raspberry (Rubus spp.) and hawkweed (Hieracium albiflorum) were the most important. A great variety of insects was taken but ants (Formicidae), snout beetles (Curculionidae), ground beetles (Carabidae), and leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) comprised the greatest volume. Douglas-fir seeds and germinants were an important sought-after junco food averaging 12%. They represented a trace in seed failure years, 6% in light seed years, and 32% in moderate to heavy seed years. Hemlock (Tsuga spp.) averaged only 1% of the food, even though it was a consistent seed producer. Seeds of redcedar (Thuja plicata) were not taken. Destruction of Douglasfir seeds and germinants by juncos should be considered when evaluating factors that may hinder regeneration.
10.2307/3533825|Growth of the chicks of two nocturnal alcids, the plankton-feeding Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) and the fish-feeding Rhinoceros Auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) were compared on Triangle Island, British Columbia, in 1978. Cassin's Auklet grew faster, attained adult weight earlier and lost less weight on a relative basis than did the Rhinoceros Auklet. The faster growth of the Cassin's Auklet apparently related to the relative large meals with high-energy plankton which the parent stores in a gular pouch for feeding its young. Differences in relative weight loss may indicate greater energy expenditure in smaller birds. Chicks of both species that hatched late were lighter at fledging than those that hatched earlier, perhaps resulting from an inadequate supply of high-quality food toward the end of the breeding season.
10.2307/3535163|We studied occurrence and activities of Snowy Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) at Coos Bay North Spit, Oregon, from September 1981 through July 1982. We found an average of 30.0 adults at the ocean beach during winter months and an average of 20.5 adults primarily at the ocean beach and dredged-material disposal sites during the breeding season. Density of breeding adults at the southern disposal site was similar to density at the ocean beach, but significantly greater than density at the other disposal sites. Higher nest density, 0.36 nests/ha, and greater nest success, 56%, occurred at the southern disposal site. The only successful nests observed were at the southern disposal site. Adults fed more at the ocean beach than at disposal sites. We concluded that both the ocean beach and disposal sites, especially the southern site, were important Snowy Plover habitats, the beach for feeding and the disposal sites for nesting. We recommended management of these habitats for Snowy Plovers.
10.2307/3534185|Nesting surveys to determine the distribution and productivity of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in Washington were conducted from 1981 through 1985. Number of known territorial pairs increased from 124 in 1981 to 227 in 1985. Comparisons between the results of this study and Grubb's 1975 study suggest that nesting Bald Eagles are increasing in number. Productivity was estimated using two methods. Productivity, as estimated by direct calculation, averaged 0.87 young per territorial pair. Data subsets utilizing the Mayfield-40% model produced an average productivity estimate of 0.59 young per territorial pair. Washington's mean productivity was lower than in many other regions. The proportion of pairs breeding was high in comparison with Alaska, where low breeding rates may indicate saturation of available habitat.
10.2307/3535045|Summer and fall aerial and boat surveys of birds within 12.5 km of the shoreline of the central and southern portions of the Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta were conducted in 1973, 1975, and 1979. Thirty-two species were observed. Ten species of sea ducks and seven species of shorebirds were most abundant. Flocks of three species of scoters constituted the majority of all birds observed and averaged 59.5 birds/km<sup>2</sup>. Density of waterfowl species averaged 16.7 birds/km<sup>2</sup> (range 0.1 to 71.1) in eight aerial surveys in July and August, with the highest density on 14 July. Waterfowl density on three boat surveys averaged 212.8 birds/km<sup>2</sup>, with a high of 595.8 birds/km<sup>2</sup> in late August. Waterfowl numbers were highest within 8 km of the mean high tide line. Density of non-waterfowl species averaged 28.4 birds/km<sup>2</sup> with peak numbers occurring after mid-July.
10.2307/3534880|The nesting habitat of Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) in the urban environment around Victoria, British Columbia was described. Nests were built on a variety of man-made structures but flat roofs were used most often. Most roof nests were built on business or commercial buildings, and were usually placed against structures on the roof. Many nests were built in sheltered places but there was no apparent preferred direction of shelter. Horizontal distance of nest sites from saltwater ranged from 0 to approximately 500 m. Reproductive parameters of urban-nesting Glaucous-winged Gulls were described and compared to those of island-nesting Glaucous-winged Gulls. Median date of clutch initiation, clutch size, incubation period, hatching success, fledging success, and mortality rate of urban-nesting and island-nesting gulls were similar. Inter-nest distances were greater for urban nests than for island nests. A study on nest-site tenacity showed gulls were persistent in attempting to nest at chosen sites.
10.2307/3535691|During a field survey in 1984-1985, Great Gray Owls (Strix nebulosa) were located at 63 sites in southcentral Oregon, with both a male and female at 25 sites, individual males at 36 sites, and individual females at two sites. Eleven nests were located, including 10 in old platform nests built by diurnal raptors and one in a cavity in a large snag. We concluded that Great Gray Owls were widely distributed in southcentral Oregon, but were common only in a few areas where there were concentrations of appropriate habitat. Of the 63 sites where owls were located, 61 were in forests adjacent to meadows. Associations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) or lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) predominated at 59 sites, and mixed conifer associations predominated at four sites. We suggest that Great Gray Owls are declining in numbers in southcentral Oregon as a result of habitat loss, and we recommend protection of existing nest sites and erection of artificial nest platforms.
10.2307/3534184|The nest distribution and habitats of Ancient Murrelets (Synthliboramphus antiguus) and Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) were compared in the Queen Charlotte Islands. Ancient Murrelets (about 254,000 breeding pairs) and Cassin's Auklets (about 236,000 pairs) nested on forested (often the same) islands. Cassin's Auklets nested in burrows in grass or moss-covered ground along island peripheries. Ancient Murrelets nested in moss habitat farther inland or along the periphery when Cassin's Auklets nested diffusely or were absent. We suggest that nesting differences are related to different chick-rearing strategies. The Queen Charlotte Island breeding population of Ancient Murrelets comprises one-half, and that of Cassin's Auklets one-quarter, of the overall population of the two species in the northeastern Pacific. The importance of the Queen Charlotte Islands to those alcids apparently relates to their preference for open nesting habitat beneath mature forest on offshore islands. A combination of a cool, moist climate and overbrowsing of tree seedlings and shrubs by coastal Black-tailed Deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) is conducive to the maintenance of the open forest habitat preferred by nesting Ancient Murrelets and Cassin's Auklets.
10.2307/3536257|The diet of nestling Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) was investigated on Triangle and Frederick Islands, British Columbia, in 1980 and 1981. Calanoid copepods, euphausiids, and fishes made up most of the prey biomass of the auklets. Hyperiid amphipods and carideans were taken frequently, but were a minor portion of the biomass. Statistically significant differences occurred in biomass and body size of prey between islands and years. The Cassin's Auklet diet apparently reflected the abundance of the calanoid copepod Neocalanus cristatus and that of the euphausiids Thysanoessa spinifera, T. longipes, and Euphausia pacifica in surface waters. Total food consumption of Cassin's Auklet chicks in the North Pacific during one nesting season was estimated at 1008 metric tons. It was calculated that 200,000 Cassin's Auklets in British Columbia brought 75.6 metric tons of zooplankton to their nestlings over a 4-week period, which is similar to the amount (70 tons) nestling Dovekies (Alle alle) received in Spitsbergen (Norderhaug 1980). Calanoid copepods, euphausiids, and amphipods form a major portion of the diet of all auklets that bring zooplankton to their young in a neck pouch. Differences in prey among those alcids is a reflection of smaller calanoid copepods taken by smaller alcids and geographical replacement of prey species.
10.2307/3536460|Four species of plants comprised 98% of the fragments in the contents of stomachs and fecal pellets of Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) during midsummer. Clover (Trifolium dubium) constituted between 57 and 63%, dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) 6%, bentgrass (Agrostis alba), 21 and 22%, and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) 7 and 12% of the diet. Clover and dandelion were preferred forage species. The percentage of a species of plant in the fecal pellets corresponded closely to the percentage of that species in the stomach contents. Forbs were slightly under-represented and grasses slightly over-represented in fecal pellets. Analyses of stomach contents and fecal pellets gave similar estimates of dietary composition and forage preferences.
10.2307/3534285|The Caspian Tern in Washington State originally nested only in eastern Washington, but now more than 80% breed in Grays Harbor in western Washington. The shifting of breeding sites in Grays Harbor during the last ten years is believed to be related to competition and predation from gulls and erosion of nestling islands. A major threat to breeding success in small colonies occurs during the incubation period when human disturbance allows gulls access to eggs. Large colonies are most affected by human disturbances when chicks run from their territories and enter the territories of other aggressive adults.
10.2307/3536459|Use of sites by diurnally roosting Pelagic Cormorants (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) was studied in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, in 1982 and 1983. The same transects were run each year from Bamfield Inlet to Cape Beale and in the Deer Group Islands to document the diurnal roosting sites used from mid- to late summer. Cormorants used essentially the same 20 roosting sites on these transects in both years (11 sites were on exposed rocks surrounded by water, five on rocky promontories, one on a cliff face, and three in caves). In 1983, 37 sites were recorded in the Broken Islands, all on exposed, unvegetated rocks. Most of these sites were used irregularly. Attendance at roosting sites in the Deer Group Islands did not differ significantly between 1982 and 1983. Arrivals and departures from the roosting sites were distributed non-randomly; birds left or arrived singly. Mean intervals of departure and arrival were 14.3 and 15.2 min, respectively. Alternate sites were used when birds were disturbed and when the local population of Pelagic Cormorants increased in October. At this time roosting cormorants also joined multispecies feeding flocks that were 50 m to 3 km from their roosting sites.
10.2307/3534881|The stomach contents of 28 Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) found dead on the Washington coast in late February and early March 1976, were examined and identified. Cephalopod beaks representing nine families were the only identifiable food items in the stomachs. Other foods reported from Fulmar stomachs are listed. The following cephalopods are reported here for the first time from the stomachs of Northern Fulmars: Abraliopsis felis, Gonatus pyros, Gonatopsis borealis, Histioteuthis heteropsis, Chiroteuthis calyx, Taonius pavo, and Japetella heathi. The bathy-mesopelagic squid Taonius pavo represented over 43% of the squid beaks found in the Northern Fulmar stomachs.
10.2307/3533827|Food habits of wintering Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were studied along the Columbia River in northcentral Washington. Subadults made up 48% of the population along Lake Pateros and 26% along adjacent Rufus Woods Lake. American Coots (Fulica americana) comprised 64% of the diet at Lake Pateros; Chukars (Alectoris chukar) 46% at Rufus Woods Lake. Eagle diets at both reservoirs included several species of gallinaceous birds. Availability, or vulnerability, of food items may influence age ratios of wintering Bald Eagles. Age ratios and corresponding diets of these eagle populations indicate coots are more vulnerable than Chukars to predation by subadult Bald Eagles but Chukars are relatively vulnerable to adults.
10.2307/3535475|Short-eared Owls (Asio flammeus) forage over coastal sedge flats in southeastern Alaska during migration. The remains contained in 80 owl castings were examined to determine the prey of migrating owls. Microtines were most abundant in the pellets with meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) accounting for 71% of all prey taken. Birds and other small mammals were consumed in lesser quantities. The mean number of prey animals per pellet was 2.20. The mean ratio of bone weight to total pellet weight was 0.33.
10.2307/3535459|At four areas in western Washington, wintering Dunlins (Calidris alpina) exhibited a regular pattern of movement (i.e. continuously followed the edge of the receding or incoming water) during 86% of the ebbing tides (N = 50) and 50% of the flooding tides (N = 24). During diurnal high tides, Dunlins roosted in fields, salt marshes, mudflats, and on log rafts. At two areas, Dunlins remained in constant flight for up to 2 hrs until the tide ebbed. Maximum numbers of Dunlins at two estuaries averaged ca. 2000 birds; two other estuaries supported ca. 13,000 and 9000 Dunlins each. At all four areas, the populations of wintering Dunlins appeared to remain relatively stable between December and March. Raptors temporarily disrupted the interhabitat movement patterns of Dunlins.
10.2307/3534113|The current status of 119 historically rare and 15 hypothetical bird species in Idaho was documented by searching the literature and consulting active bird watchers in the state. We considered species with fewer than ten records in Burleigh (1972) as rare, unless Larrison et al. (1967) demonstrated otherwise. A total of 57 new birds have been recorded in Idaho since 1960. Pacific water birds provided 14 of these records. Eight new birds were from the Great Basin/southwestern deserts, four were West Coast land birds, and six were western birds fitting none of the above categories. Fifteen new species were from northeastern North America and seven were from southeastern North America. Three new species were arctic land birds. Rare species of birds have been observed in Idaho with increased frequency in the last two decades.
10.2307/3535377|According to the literature, the range of the North American muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) along the coastal Pacific Northwest extends southerly only as far as Coos County, Oregon. My investigations, conducted in the summer of 1972, disclosed that muskrats, with the aid of 3 confirmed introductions around the year 1930, have today extended their coastal distribution approximately 120 miles southward through Oregon's southwestern corner, Curry County, and south throughout coastal Del Norte County, California to the Klamath River. Also, today muskrats have established themselves in every county of Oregon. Oregon State Game Commission Annual Trapping Reports show muskrats in all but 2 counties of Oregon as early as 1945. Also on the basis of pelage coloration, physical size, and knowledge of previous muskrat introduction and places of origin, it appears the Del Norte and Curry County muskrat is most closely related to the Oregon Coast muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus occipitalis) but is also slightly intermixed with a darker eastern subspecies possibly Ondatra zibethicus zibethicus.
10.2307/3534186|The rates of occurrence of dead birds were determined for beach and water segment censuses in 1978 and 1979 in the inland marine waters of Washington. There were 110 birds of 25 species found dead on beach censuses. The rates of occurrence of dead birds were low in comparison with other studies: beach censuses--0 to 1.47 birds/km; aerial-shoreline censuses--0 to 4.7 birds/10<sup>3</sup> km; aerial-open water censuses--0 to 9.0 birds/10<sup>3</sup> km; ferry-shoreline censuses--0 to 6.9 birds/10<sup>3</sup> km; and ferry-open water censuses--0 to 9.3 birds/10<sup>3</sup> km. The rates of occurrence of dead birds on study area beaches were decidedly lower than comparable values from Washington beaches facing the Pacific Ocean. Aircraft, small boat, and ferry observation rates were much lower than beach rates.
10.2307/3534030|American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythroryhnchos) re-established nesting in the Malheur-Harney Lakes Basin in 1985 when seven pairs fledged three young on a small greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus) island. In 1986, nesting efforts increased to an estimated 140 nests in four colonies with a total production of 125 young. Nesting islands were less than 1 ha in size, apparently free from mammalian predators, and occupied by other bird species which had poineered the island before pelicans initiated nesting. On three islands greasewood shrubs dominated the vegetation, providing shade for the prefledged young. On the shrubless island shade was provided by tall forbs.
10.2307/3533828|The major types of prey taken by Tufted Puffins (Lunda cirrhata) and Horned Puffins (Fratercula corniculata) were determined by analyzing the stomach contents of 120 adult and 15 subadult Tufted Puffins and 85 adult and 8 subadult Horned Puffins collected at two sites in Alaska during the summers of 1975-77. Fish, squid, and polychaetes were the most common prey types observed with 26.3% of all stomachs containing plastic material. The relative frequencies of prey types, including plastic, varied both intra-and inter-specifically between age classes and locations and/or years. The results indicate that both puffin species are opportunistic in their feeding habits, taking advantage of locally or temporarily abundant prey.
10.2307/3534205|Numerous dead and dying birds were observed in the Bering Sea north of the Pribilof Islands in July 1979. All dead and dying birds were associated with slicks of white waxy particles that upon melting yielded a yellowish oil. The unknown particles had the characteristics of a natural lipid and may have been the product of an intense plankton bloom.
10.2307/3533829|Food habits were analyzed for sympatric populations of Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) and Mountain Bluebirds (S. currucoides) breeding in southcentral Washington. Adults of the two species differed in prey selection for all parts of the nesting cycle, except for the time from arrival on breeding grounds until eggs hatched. Interspecific dietary overlap between adults was high (61%) when based on frequency of occurrence of prey taxa in stomachs. Before eggs hatched, adult Western Bluebirds consumed primarily Coleoptera and Lepidoptera larvae; adult Mountain Bluebirds took Coleoptera and Arachnida most frequently. After eggs hatched, adults consumed different prey species than those fed to nestlings. The main taxa, in terms of frequency, fed to nestlings of both species were Orthoptera and Coleoptera. In terms of biomass, Western Bluebird nestlings received mostly Orthoptera (75.9%) and Coleoptera (13.4%), and Mountain Bluebird nestlings received Orthoptera (58.3%) and Homoptera (22.9%) Interspecific dietary overlap between nestlings was high (62%), whereas overlap between adults and nestlings was low (Western Bluebirds 22%; Mountain Bluebirds 29%). Taxonomic frequency and biomass frequency of prey fed to nestlings were positively correlated for both bluebird species. Adult bluebirds fed heavier items to nestlings and consumed lighter items themselves. Differences in prey fed to nestlings and that consumed by adults can be related to adult foraging behaviors.
10.2307/3533976|From 1953 to the present, the writer has been interested in the ingress of porcupines into redwood and Douglas fir forests of northwestern California. The first known observation of a porcupine seen in Humboldt County occurred in 1908 on the Harrow Ranch near Ettersburg. The second record was about 1930 at the Humboldt-Trinity County Line on Lassic Peak, 10 miles west of Ruth, Trinity County. The third record was in July 1941 on the Redwood Creek drainage. The first known record for Del Norte County was about 1930 when William Stevens observed one on the old Ship Mountain Trail (R 4E-T 16N). Few records have been obtained for the 1940's and early 1950's, but from the late 1950's on there are numerous records for both counties.
10.2307/3536012|Avian densities and guild structure were studied in an open Douglasfir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stand on a south-facing slope and in a dense lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stand on a north-facing slope. Both stands have been greatly modified by past logging activities and forest fires. Twenty-seven bird species were censused on the two forests. Fifteen species were common to both types, six species were unique to the Douglas-fir plot, and six species were unique to the lodgepole pine plot. Both density and number of species increased in both stands from 1967 to 1968. Largest increases occurred in populations of the Dark-eyed Junco, Chipping Sparrow, Evening Grosbeak, Pine Siskin, Yellow-rumped Warbler, and Hermit Thrush. A spruce budworm outbreak apparently contributed to these increases. Differences in guild composition are attributed to structural features of the forests.
10.2307/3535265|We studied fall and winter food habits of adult and immature Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) as well as the composition and biomass of prey found in nests in eastern Washington during 1974-1981. Bird and mammal remains occurred with almost equal frequencies at nests, but mammals dominated in terms of biomass. Yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) were the most important food of nestling eagles, both in frequency and biomass. Number of prey species and number of prey items found at nests were not related to the number of different habitats within a 2-km radius of the nest. Carrion appeared to be the most important fall and winter food of Golden Eagles with waterfowl and gallinaceous birds less important.
10.2307/3534286|The diet of Glaucous-winged Gull (Larus glaucescens) adults and chicks was studied in 5 breeding colonies in the Strait of Georgia and in 3 colonies on the west coast of Vancouver Island in 1980. Adult gulls ate mostly human refuse in the Strait of Georgia and gooseneck barnacles (Pollicipes polymerus) on the west coast, while chicks were fed mostly herring (Clupea harengus) in the Strait, and Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), herring, and Pacific sauries (Cololabis saira) on the west coast. Of the intertidal foods of adult gulls, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) predominated in the Strait, and California or sea mussels (Mytilus californianus) and gooseneck barnacles on the west coast. Glaucous-winged Gull foods reflect abundance and accessibility of prey items in the two regions.
10.2307/3536013|During a spruce budworm outbreak in western Montana nearly all 21 bird species in the five feeding guilds in two different forest types foraged in the tree canopy where there were large numbers of spruce budworm larvae, pupae, and adults. Several breeding bird species may have responded functionally to the large spruce budworm outbreak. Most data on foraging were taken from males. Some males, particularly in the foliage-insect guild, foraged in the same zone in which they sang.
10.2307/3534687|During 1978-1982, 270 Bald Eagle nests at 147 breeding sites were located and observed in Oregon. Three regions of nesting concentration were (1) the Klamath Basin, (2) the Cascade lakes, and (3) the coast and lower Columbia River. Bald Eagle breeding activities were observed between 1 January and 31 August with adults observed at some nest sites year-round. The 100 occupied sites recorded in 1982 represent a minimum population of 100 breeding pairs of Bald Eagles in the state. Productivity (0.72 to 1.18 young fledged/occupied site) was comparable to populations in Alaska, Florida, and the Great Lakes states where populations were considered to be stable. However, a possible decline in productivity from 1978 to 1982 should be monitored in subsequent years to assess the stability of the breeding population.
10.2307/3533766|Prior to 1939, only 2 records of Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) had been reported from Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) and no records of breeding swans were known. Attempts to establish a breeding population at Malheur NWR with transplants from Red Rock Lakes NWR, Montana, began in 1939. Several transplants were made before the first broods of swans were produced in 1958. From 1958 through 1984, 288 cygnets fledged at Malheur NWR. Most Trumpeters nested in the Blitzen Valley, but some nested on Malheur Lake, in the Double-O area, and on the Island Ranch north of the refuge. The population now appears to be stable, but the limiting factors are largely unknown. Circumstantial evidence suggests that some young swans are leaving the area prior to sexual maturity.
10.2307/3533765|Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) regularly hauled out at Yaquina Estuary only during tides lower than about +0.3 m. Few seals (and no pups) were present during the pupping season in May and June. The greatest numbers hauled out in August or September; a smaller secondary peak appeared in February in two of six years. Seal abundance was about the same from 1977-1983, with the summer maximum ranging from 40 to 72 seals.
10.2307/3534203|Breeding populations of Double-crested (Phalacrocorax auritus) and Pelagic Cormorants (P. pelagicus) were surveyed in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, in 1983. Double-crested Cormorant numbers have increased 2.4-fold and Pelagic Cormorant numbers 1.1-fold since 1975. Double-crested Cormorant populations are presently not only increasing in British Columbia but all across Canada and in the northeastern United States. These increases are thought to be the result of decreased disturbance and persecution by man.
10.2307/3536362|Although the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) was classed as being rarely found in the Portland, Oregon area as late as 1940, it is now common. Between June 4 and September 30, 1968, 3,522 were trapped and removed from a 1-acre blueberry planting just outside the city limits. Of those removed, 97.9 percent were hatching year birds.
10.2307/3535264|We analyzed the plumages and songs of Hermit (Dendroica occidentalis) and Townsend's (D. townsendi) Warblers and their hybrids. We identified one male F<sub>1</sub> and six male backcross (to Hermit Warbler) hybrids; the parentage of the remaining two putative hybrid specimens could not be identified. The majority of 16 reported sightings of hybrids were backcrosses. A single putative female hybrid was identified as an F<sub>1</sub> hybrid. Sonographic analysis indicated that all hybrids thus far recorded have sung only Hermit Warbler-type songs. Preliminary playback experiments showed that Hermit and Townsend's Warblers and their hybrids responded aggressively to songs of both species.
