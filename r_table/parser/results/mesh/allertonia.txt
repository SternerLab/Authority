23187389|Timonius subgenus Timonius consists of eight species of trees and shrubs distributed throughout southeastern Malesia and tropical Australia. The subgenus appears to be monophyletic, all member species having valvate-calyptrate stipules and numerous ovules arranged around an elongate, pendulous placenta. A cladistic analysis shows that T. timon and its closest relatives from an unresolved polytomy and share advanced characters of calyx morphology as well as foliar domatioid nectaries. Keys are provided to all taxa. Three new combinations (Timonius timon var. grandiflorus, T. timon var. whiteanus, and T. tomentosus) are made; two new varieties (T. timon var. buloloensis and T. timon var. reticulatus) and one new species (T. lageniferus) are described.
23186078|All species of the fern family Thelypteridaceae known to occur on islands in the Pacific Ocean (excluding the area covered by Flora Malesiana) and in Australasia are described, with keys to genera and species and with references to publications on ferns of the region. Included information is based on the examination of specimens deposited in many herbaria, including the types of almost all species. Seven new species are described: Christella guamensis, Coryphopteris raiateana, Parathelypteris rechingeri, Plesioneuron marquesicum, Sphaerostephanos braithwaitei, S. scandens, and S. veitchii, and also two new varieties: Coryphopteris pubirachis var. tahitensis and Pneumatopteris costata var. hispida. Sixteen new specific combinations and one new varietal combination are made in this paper.
23188211|This paper is preliminary to a treatment of the Orchidaceae of Fiji to be included in Flora Vitiensis Nova (A. C. Smith), discussing details, mostly nomenclatural in nature, of the 63 genera and 168 species to be included in that account. Only indigenous and naturalized taxa are included. Of the 162 species of orchids, belonging to 59 genera, now believed to be indigenous in Fiji, 54 are considered to be endemic. Two new sectional names are required: Appendicula sect. Stenodesme and Malaxis sect. Oistochilus. Ten new specific combinations here proposed are: Peristylus tradescantifolius, P. maculifer, P. stenodon, P. aliformis, Goodyera vitiensis, Pristiglottis longiflora, P. degeneri, Malaxis tetraloba, M. reineckeana, and M. whitmeei. Twenty-four new species are described: Erythrodes parvula, Dendrobium trilobulatum, D. carnicarinum, D. unicarinatum, Agrostophyllum aristatum, Glomera emarginata, Aglossorhyncha bilobula, Calanthe imthurnii, Spathoglottis smithii, Bulbophyllum simmondsii, B. aristopetalum, B. hassallii, B. amplistigmaticum, B. quadricarinum, B. incommodum, Phreatia gillespiei, P. bigibbula, P. pentagona, P. flavovirens, Sarcochilus williamsianus, Cleisostoma longipaniculatum, Microtatorchis smithii, Taeniophyllum confusum, and T. smithii.
23186086|A precursor account is given of a project to locate and interpret in modern terms as many as practical of the specimens collected by the Forsters, naturalists on Capt. James Cook's second circumnavigation in H.M.S. Resolution, and to describe the botanical results and the nomenclatural problems surrounding this beginning of Pacific botany. A number of examples of species are listed and discussed to illustrate the difficulties involved and to give a preview of the anticipated interpretation of the Forster collections, now known to be represented in at least 25 herbaria. Two new combinations (Ixora foetida (L. f.) Fosberg and Wollastonia lifuana (Hochr.) Fosberg) are made; one new name (Allophylus paniger Fosberg) is proposed; and one new species (Xylosma smithiana Fosberg) is described.
24367690|A revison of Barringtonia (Lecythidaceae subfamily Planchonioideae) is made to update the 1967 monograph of Payens. Sixty-nine species are recognized, 23 of which have been described since 1967 including the two new species described here, B. chantaranoi Prance and B. magnifolia Prance. Four circumscriptions of Abdulmajidia were previously transferred to Barringtonia (Prance, 2010). The circumscription of several species have been changed from those of Payens, especially those of B. edulis Seem and B. samoensis A. Gray. Barringtonia boridiensis Knuth, B. clemensii Knuth, B. confusa Lutjeh. & V. Oostr., B. longipes Gagenep., and B. flagellata Lutjeh & v. Oostr., which were placed in synonomy by Payens, are resurrected as good species. The division of the genus into the two sections Barringtonia and Stravadium by previous authors is accepted here. Three centers of diversity of the genus are recognized: Malay Peninsula and adjacent Thailand, Borneo, and New Guinea. There are a few species distributed across the Pacific as far as the Marquesas Island and two reach East Africa and Madagascar. Distribution maps, a list of all the exsiccatae studied, and color photos of selected species are provided.
23189298|Euodia consists of seven species and ranges from New Guinea and northeastern Australia east to Samoa, Tonga, and Niue. Melicope, with 233 species, ranges from the Malagasy and Indo-Himalaya regions east to the Hawaiian and Marquesas Islands and south to New Zealand. Euodia is revised in full. For Melicope, in which four sections are recognized, only taxa of the Indo-HimalayaPacific region excluding Hawaii are dealt with in full, but a complete generic synonymy is given and the Malagasy and Hawaiian taxa are placed to section. The closest relatives of Euodia and Melicope appear to be Boronella, Myrtopsis, Brombya, Medicosma, Perryodendron, and Acronychia. Euodia may have descended from Boronella-like ancestry, and Melicope most likely descended from Euodia-like ancestry. The diagnostic characters of Euodia and Melicope appear to be restricted to the fruit (which is exclusively dehiscent) and seed. When the fruit of Euodia dehisces, the endocarp is elastically discharged with the seed. The testa is thin and brittle and is composed of an inner layer of sclerenchyma (the sclerotesta) and an outer layer of compact parenchymatous tissue. The seeds are brown to blackish and dull to lustrous, but never shiny. On their ventral surface they tend to retain a piece of endocarp tissue which evidently serves as an attractant for their dispersal by ants. The testa probably lacks the structural strength required for endozoochory. Melicope, in contrast, is manifestly specialized for endozoochory. When the fruit dehisces, neither the endocarp nor the seed is discharged. The seeds, which are probably most often eaten by arboreal birds, are usually prominently displayed in the dehisced fruit and have a shiny, black pellicle which enhances their visibility. The sclerotesta is much thicker than that of Euodia and is very resistant to breakage. It is surrounded by a layer of spongy tissue (the sarcotesta), the nutritive value of which is the reward for the vector. The results are presented of a survey of the external pollen morphology of Euodia and Melicope and the 30 other genera of non-boronioid, non-aurantioid Rutaceae that occur naturally in the MalesianAustralasian region. Among these genera only Lunasia and Skimmia are distinct on their pollen, and the variability seen in the pollen of Melicope encompasses essentially all of that encountered in the other genera. The infrageneric classifications of Euodia and Melicope are based largely on assumptions regarding the evolutionary polarity of the states of morphological characters. Four characters are useful for the infrageneric classification of Euodia. Eighteen are useful for that of Melicope. Three species known exclusively from fossils have been attributed to Euodia. Two of these appear to be more correctly placed in Tetradium. The third is probably best referred to the form genus Carpolithus. Fossils have apparently not been reported for Melicope. Euodia and Melicope are usually found in ever-wet forest. Both genera also occur in the maquis of New Caledonia, and Melicope is also known from monsoon forest, savannah, Eucalyptus woodland, subalpine shrubbery, and alpine grassland. Euodia and Melicope appear to have originated in Australasia in the Cretaceous. Euodia probably acquired its extra-Australasian distribution in the last few million years. Melicope probably colonized Madagascar from Australia via India in the Cretaceous. The Asian region was probably colonized entirely from Australasia. Plants of Melicope sect. Melicope may have colonized the Asian region prior to the Middle Miocene. Those of Melicope sect. Pelea and Melicope sect. Lepta probably did so after that time. Melicope apparently colonized the Pacific Basin entirely from the AustralasianOuter Melanesian region. For the archipelagoes on which they occur, the present Pacific Basin species of Melicope can be attributed to perhaps 12 colonization events: two for the Caroline Islands, one each for the Hawaiian and Marquesas Islands, two each for the Society and Austral Islands, one for the Cook Islands, and three for Samoa. The migrations in the Pacific, particularly to the more remote archipelagoes, must have occurred at times when the Pacific Basin had more islands suitable for occupancy by Melicope
24367440|The nine small islets comprising the Ringgold Islands represent the most northeastern islands of Fiji. Some of the islets are limestone, while others are coral and sand accumulations on a reef. The largest of the nine, Naqelelevu, is only 147 ha in area and 18 m in elevation. These islets apparently have never been studied botanically. The author carried out a botanical survey on seven of the nine in June and July of 2008. Checklists of the flora were made for each islet and were compiled into a comprehensive checklist for the whole group. To determine the forest composition and dominant species, sampling was conducted at ten sites. At each site, 100 (50 in the mangrove area) trees were randomly selected and measured for dbh. These data were summarized in a table indicating relative dominance of tree species. The vegetation can be divided into four communities; littoral strand, limestone forest, mangrove forest, and ruderal vegetation. The most common littoral forest trees were Neisosperma oppositifolium, Pisonia grandis, and Guettarda speciosa. The most common limestone forest species were Dysoxylum richii, Diospyros samoensis, Planchonella grayana, Ficus cf. scabra, and Mammea odorata. In disturbed forest and ruderal vegetation, the most common species were coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Glochidion concolor, and Dendrocnide harveyi. The most common (and only) mangrove forest species were Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Xylocarpus granatum. A total of 152 native and naturalized plant species was recorded on the islands, and another 32 ornamental or crop plants. Three new species not previously recorded in Fiji in the published literature were found; Sarcolobus retusa (Asclepiadaceae), Boerhavia albiflora (Nyctaginaceae), and Corchorus trilocularis (Tiliaceae). Fijian names were also recorded for most of the common plants.
23186117|The Hawaiian endemic genera Argyroxiphium, Dubautia, and Wilkesia comprise an extremely diverse, yet monophyletic group of 28 species. The nearest relatives of this assemblage appear to be the Pacific Coast tarweeds (Madiinae) of North America. Life forms represented among the Hawaiian alliance include cushion plants, mat-forming subshrubs, shrubs, monocarpic and polycarpic rosette shrubs, trees, and a liana. This array of life forms occupies a multitude of habitats ranging from the very driest to the very wettest in the islands at elevations extending from near sea level to 3,750 m. The diversity of habit and habitat is also paralleled by considerable variation in the anatomical features of these plants. Anatomical data are reviewed in the context of the present taxonomy. A summary of existing chromosome number reports for these genera, together with 47 new counts, indicates that 19 species have n = 14 chromosomes while nine species have n = 13. Biosystematic and cytogenetic studies further indicate that the 14-paired genome has evolved to produce at least four chromosome races which are differentiated by reciprocal chromosome translocations. Studies of physiological ecology demonstrate that the 13-paired species exhibit altered tissue osmotic and elastic properties compared to the 14-paired species. In spite of this remarkable overall diversity, 35 different naturally occurring interspecific and intergeneric hybrids have been detected. Even the most sterile of these are capable of producing F2 offspring. An additional 29 unique interspecific and intergeneric hybrid combinations have been produced artificially. The extraordinary diversity exhibited by this genetically cohesive group makes the Hawaiian Madiinae a premier example of adaptive radiation. The taxonomic treatment recognizes three genera, 28 species, and 13 additional subspecies. A distribution map and leaf illustration are provided for each taxon. Illustrations representing various other features of the alliance are also included. Dubautia ciliolata subsp. glutinosa, D. imbricata subsp. acronaea, D. knudsenii subsp. filiformis, and D. plantaginea subsp. humilis are described as new taxa.
23185856|Late island is a recent volcano situated about 50 km. west-southwest of Vava'u in northern Tonga. The disharmonic flora of this now uninhabited island consists of 145 indigenous taxa of vascular plants and 49 taxa of introduced plants; i.e. it is poorer than the Tongan volcanoes of Kao and Tofua to the south or Niuafo'ou, Tafahi, and Niuatoputapu to the north. The most prominent community on Late is Casuarina litorea forest, which occupies many of the younger and more exposed lava flows, while on the top of the crater cone above 500 m. there are elements of a moisture-demanding cloud or moss forest flora such as occurs at higher altitudes on other volcanoes in the region.
23185880|Taxonomic discussions and revisions of the Micronesian species of three genera of the family Rubiaceae, Hedyotis, Psychotria, and Tarenna, all widespread in the Pacific islands and westward, are presented as precursors to the treatment of the family for the Flora of Micronesia. Though the species are mostly endemic to Micronesia, some occur as far west as India and Ceylon and as far south and east as Tahiti and the Marquesas. The genus Leptopetalum Hook. & Arnott is reduced to subgeneric rank in Hedyotis L. New species are described in Hedyotis and Psychotria L., as well as new varieties in Hedyotis, Psychotria, and Tarenna Gaertn. The entire Micronesian representation of Amaracarpus Blume is transferred to Psychotria and treated as a series of varieties of Psychotria hombroniana (Baill.) Fosberg. Keys are provided for Micronesian Hedyotis and Psychotria species and for the varieties of Tarenna sambucina (Forst. f.) Gaertn.
23187400|This paper is an ethnobotanical study of the Cook Islands, located in the South Pacific and belonging culturally to "Eastern Polynesia". It is based upon an extensive literature review and four research trips to the Cook Islands from 1984 to 1986, during which numerous informants were interviewed and a large collection of botanical specimens was gathered. In the paper, the plants used in the culture are listed in alphabetical order by their Maori (Cook Island) names, and each of the approximately 500 entries includes the scientific and English names, habitat and frequency information, citation of any voucher specimens, uses for the plants in the Maori culture, and comparisons with related plant names in other Polynesian languages.
23189184|The historical background is given for the presence of 222 herbarium sheets from Captain James Cook's first and second expeditions, mostly J. R. Forster and G. Forster collections, housed in the Copenhagen herbarium (C). This is followed by a systematic catalogue of the species with citation of all text on the sheets. A concise itinerary and route maps for Cook's second expedition are given. Some of the plants and text on the sheets are illustrated. Persons in the historical part, currently accepted plant names, and Forster names in the catalogue are all indexed.
23190459|Studies of the gynoecium at various developmental stages in Lepinia marquisensis Lorence & W.L. Wagner were made to ascertain how these peculiar fruits come to be. The fused basal region was found to be a solid gynophore. The united apices are due to early postgenital fusion. Whereas the gynophore and postgenitally fused apical region do not elongate appreciably during fruit development, the central apocarpous region undergoes rapid elongation, thus forming the characteristic graceful, basket-like fruit. Despite its atypical fruits, Lepinia clearly belongs in the tribe Alyxieae as defined by Leeuwenberg (1994).
23188172|Deppea (Rubiaceae) is characterized by its 4-merous flowers, yellow (rarely white, orange, or purple) corollas with contorted aestivation in bud, bilocular ovary with vertical, axile placentas, numerous ovules, capsular fruits with apical, loculicidal dehiscence, and numerous, small, angular seeds with a foveolate or reticulate testa. The majority of species are shrubs or treelets distributed in the montane forests of southern Mexico and adjacent Guatemala, where they generally occur along watercourses, although one species ranges from Mexico through Central America, one is endemic to Panama, and one occurs disjunctly in southeastern Brazil. A key to species is provided, and synonyms, descriptions, distributions, habitat, discussions, and herbarium specimens examined are given for each species. Twenty-five species are recognized, of which five are newly described (D. guerrerensis, D. hernandezii, D. martinez-calderonii, D. oaxacana, and D. purpurascens), two new combinations are made (D. blumenaviensis and D. scoti), and one new name is proposed (D. schultzei).
23186092|Quantitative and qualitative wood anatomy data are presented for 106 collections of Solanaceae, representing 21 genera and 82 species. Wood expressions are diverse in Solanaceae: wood is ring porous to diffuse porous; vessels have simple perforation plates (rarely vestiges of bars); lateral wall pitting is alternate; grooves and/or helical thickenings are present in vessels of some species; imperforate tracheary elements range from true tracheids with pits 57 m in diameter (Brunfelsia, Fabiana) to fiber-tracheids with pit cavities 1 m in diameter; vasicentric tracheids and vascular tracheids occur in a scattering of species; axial parenchyma is diffuse, diffuse-in-aggregates, narrow banded, ray-adjacent, and vasicentric scanty; rays are basically Heterogeneous Type IIB, but in particular species they approach or attain Heterogeneous III, Homogeneous I, Homogeneous III, Paedomorphic I, and Paedomorphic III; crystal sand and rhomboidal crystals are present in fibriform thin-walled idioblasts, fiber-tracheids, axial parenchyma, and ray cells in a scattering of species. Solanaceae range into many habitats, and degree of wood xeromorphy or mesomorphy sensitively correlates these with respect to vessel diameter, vessel density, vessel element length, presence of vasicentric tracheids, and presence of helical sculpture on vessels. There is in Solanaceae as well as in other families a continuum, demonstrable with SEM, between the phenomena of grooves interconnecting pit apertures (confluent pit apertures), grooves accompanied by thickening bands, and presence of helical thickenings (without grooves) in vessels of Solanaceae; these conditions are included under the inclusive heading of helical sculpture. Degree of grouping of vessels is proportional to xeromorphy except in Brunfelsia and Fabiana, which have tracheids that deter vessel grouping as in other dicotyledonous woods. Wood of scandent Solanaceae is distinctive and similar to that of other climbing dicotyledons. A predominance of upright ray cells, tallness of multiseriate rays, and other features indicate paedomorphosis clearly in wood of some Solanaceae (e.g., Datura meteloides, Solanum xantii), but the family appears to have had a woody ancestry. Imperforate tracheary elements with living contents show minimal diameter of pit cavities. A feature such as crystal sand presence links Solanaceae closely to the satellite families Duckeodendraceae, Goetzeaceae, and Nolanaceae. Newly reported for the family are silica bodies in rays (Acnistus) and bordered pits in sclerosed tyloses (Solanum gayanum).
23188993|Aluminum ores have been mined in the Caribbean countries of Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Simulated mining occurred on Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands. Attempts were made to reestablish a vegetation cover in each area. The author was involved in many of these operations in various ways from 1947 to 1988. This paper reports on the methods and plants used to rehabilitate each area and the present status of the mine sites. In each country areas of vegetation growing on deposits of commercial quality aluminum ores were studied to determine the market value of the vegetation, the desirability of replacing it or substituting another crop, and the occurrence of species of plants known to be accumulators of aluminum ions. In the Caribbean countries mining occurred in ore bodies on a limestone base and resulted in pits of various sizes and depths. Slope establishment and erosion control within the pits were major problems. No liming was needed prior to planting, and general purpose fertilizers with minor elements proved to be adequate. Introduced species of Pinus grew well in Jamaica when mycorrhizae were supplied. Senna siamea (Lam.) Irwin & Barneby and Hibiscus elatus Sw. were the best timber-producing trees in Jamaica. Artocarpus altilis (S. Parkinson) Fosberg, Persea americana Mill., Mangifera indica L., Blighia sapida Koenig, and Bixa orellana L. all produced market quality fruit. When the rehabilitated mined-out areas in Jamaica were re-examined in 1987, the few still under the control of the mining companies showed the success of the effort. Where the lands were available to local people the pastures had been over-grazed, the potential timber trees had been cut, and fruit-producing plants had been neglected. Only secondhand reports are available for the mined area of Haiti. Two areas of mining were studied in the Dominican Republic. In the lower elevation of Las Mercedes, excavation of ore had been halted temporarily, and no rehabilitation was attempted. At the higher elevation of Aceitillar rehabilitation was started, then terminated. Consequently, the trees planted have had insufficient time to offer significant results. Regrettably, the Aceitillar area has range cattle, which have mutilated many young plantings. Simulated mining occurred in Hawaii, with the ore dumped in valleys. Mined-out areas could be terraced and the stripsoil areas prepared by using machines. The stripsoil required the addition of limestone and the adjustment of the pH. Additions of chemical fertilizer including minor elements were necessary. Even though the altitude of the experimental area was above that of local agriculture, the trials of many vegetables, forage grasses, ornamental shrubs, and fruit trees indicated that the treated mined-out areas were more productive during the period of study than the original soils. Although many of the trees planted on the rehabilitated stripsoil were removed after the project was inactivated, some timber trees remained in 1987. The best were Albizia falcataria L. (=Paraserianthes falcataria (L.) I. Nielsen), Araucaria columnaris Hooker, Eucalyptus punctata DC., Eucalyptus saligna Sw., Toona ciliata M. Roemer, and Tristania conferta R. Br. (=Lophostemon confertus (R. Br.) P. G. Wilson & Waterhouse).
23190460|A revised circumscription of the French Polynesian genus Oparanthus (Asteraceae, Heliantheae, Coreopsidinae) is presented, with illustrations and complete descriptions of all species. In this classification four species are included, two from the Marquesas Islands and two from the island of Rapa. Recognition of Oparanthus as a genus, rather than including it in Bidens, is merited on the basis of a suite of floral characters not found together in any species of Bidens sensu stricto (pistillate ray florets, functionally staminate disk florets, and disk florets always with four corolla lobes) as well as two vegetative characters that are uncommon in Bidens (simple leaves and shrubby or arborescent habit). Two new combinations are made, transferring Bidens hivoana O. Deg. & Sherff and Bidens teikiteetinii Florence & Stuessy to Oparanthus, and a new section is described. The two sections are distinguished mainly on the basis of different corolla colors, striking differences in leaf thickness, and differences in the involucre and ray achenes; these characters correlate exactly with geographic distribution, O. sect. Albiflori being endemic to the Marquesas Islands and O. sect. Oparanthus being endemic to Rapa. Previous taxonomic, systematic, and anatomical research on these species is reviewed, and possible relationships within the subtribe are discussed.
23189182|Delarbrea is a distinct, well-delimited genus of araliaceous treelets and small trees comprising six species, two of which are further divided into two subspecies each. The genus is centered in New Caledonia; D. paradoxa subsp. paradoxa also extends through Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to the Moluccas and Lesser Sunda Islands, and D. michieana is endemic to Queensland, Australia. Delarbrea (including Porospermum) and its close relatives Myodocarpus and Pseudosciadium form a monophyletic assemblage with several common features: a clasping petiole base, articulated pedicels, five stamens, a bicarpellate gynoecium, and large secretory oil ducts in the fruit; the last is unique to the group and is almost certainly a shared, derived character. This group probably represents an old lineage within Araliaceae, and it may have been among the many remnants of the late Cretaceousearly Tertiary Australian flora that have survived in New Caledonia but were eliminated from Australia after their separation. It is not yet possible to determine whether Delarbrea michieana is a relict species or is derived from a more recent arrival via long-distance dispersal. Delarbrea paradoxa subsp. paradoxa most likely reached areas to the north and west of New Caledonia relatively recently, probably sometime after the Miocene. This taxon appears well adapted for long-distance dispersal to and establishment in new areas: it is the most common species in New Caledonia, where it occurs in a wide variety of habitat types; it is not a substrate specialist; and it has fleshy fruits that are probably bird-dispersed. Analytical keys are provided to the species and subspecies, along with a complete synonymy, detailed description, illustration, and distribution map for each taxon. Delarbrea paradoxa subsp. depauperata Lowry is described as new; it appears to be an allopatric derivative of the typical subspecies adapted to the special conditions of dry, maquis vegetation. One new combination is made, D. montana subsp. arborea (Vieill. ex R. Viguier) Lowry, and seven names are lectotypified.
23186114|During the preparation of the Vascular Flora of the Marquesas Islands and Flore de la Polynsie franaise, seven new species of Psychotria L. (Rubiaceae, Psychotrieae) have come to light and are described herein: Psychotria florencei Lorence & W. L. Wagner, P. gagneorum Lorence & W. L. Wagner, P. oliveri Lorence & W. L. Wagner, P. schaeferi Lorence & W. L. Wagner, P. temetiuensis Lorence & W. L. Wagner, P. upapoensis Lorence & W. L. Wagner, and P. uahukensis Lorence & W. L. Wagner. In addition to these new taxa, we recognize the following six species of Psychotria previously described from the Marquesas: P. adamsonii Fosberg, P. hivaoana Fosberg, P. marchionica Drake, P. mumfordiana F. Brown, P. taupotinii F. Brown, and P. toviana F. Brown. Two names are reduced to synonymy: P. bowermanae Fosberg, syn. nov. under P. toviana, and P. lebronnecii Fosberg, syn. nov. under P. marchionica. Based on morphology, the 13 endemic species appear to represent three independent colonizations of the Marquesas Islands: 1) P. oliveri and P. schaeferi; 2) P. adamsonii; and 3) the remaining 10 species.
23193787|Pohnpei is one of the four states of the Federated States of Micronesia, and is the third largest and highest island in Micronesia. About 60% of the island is steep and mountainous, with rocky peaks and ridges alternating with deep valleys, many with streams. Pohnpei's tropical climate, high rainfall, and deep, weathered soils support a diversity of plant life. With 397 indigenous and endemic plant species and infraspecies identified to date, Pohnpei constitutes one of the world's important floristic conservation hotspots. This work presents the results of a decade of continuing botanical exploration of the state of Pohnpei. Currently 935 species of native and non-native vascular plants are recognized for the flora of Pohnpei. Of these, 397 taxa are considered native (indigenous plus endemic), whereas naturalized and cultivated plants comprise 538 taxa or 57.5% of the total flora. The rate of endemism is 12.8% for the native flora. Introduced plants, currently totaling 538 species, significantly outnumber the natives and include 360 species cultivated for food, fiber, medicinal, cultural, ornamental, and other purposes. There are 178 naturalized aliens, of which 17 are considered to be extremely aggressive and invasive weeds. Information is presented on their local and common names, status (indigenous, endemic, cultivated, naturalized, or invasive), habit, local ethnobotanical uses, and herbarium voucher specimens. To facilitate identification, 556 photo illustrations are presented, one per genus. One new combination is made: Cyclosorus ponapeanus (Hosok.) Lorence, based on Phegopteris ponapeana Hosok.
23190458|A fourth species of the anomalous Pacific genus Lepinia (Apocynaceae, subfamily Plumerioideae, tribe Alyxieae) is described from the Marquesas Islands. The new species, Lepinia marquisensis Lorence & W. L. Wagner, differs from the other species in having elongate-obconical, weakly quadrangular fruiting carpels, corolla tube ca. 25 mm long, and the leaf blades broadest above the middle. The 45 uniovulate carpels are congenitally syncarpous at the base and become postgenitally permanently fused at the apex with an apocarpous region in between, making Lepinia relatively isolatedand uniquein the family.
23190461|Grammitis marquesensis Parris and G. cincta Copel. ex Parris are described as new species from the Marquesas Islands; both are endemic to the islands of Hiva Oa and Nuku Hiva. The new combination Grammitis uapensis (E. D. Br.) Parris is proposed based on Polypodium hookeri var. uapense E. D. Br. from Ua Pou. A key is provided to the Marquesan species of Grammitidaceae.
23190051|A study of the native medicinal practices in the south Pacific archipelago of Samoa was carried out by the author. Based on interviews in the Samoan language with 25 native healers, a list of 85 plant species used medicinally was complied. The list includes the scientific names, Samoan names, specific medicinal uses, and frequency of usage. The usages are compared with other studies in Polynesia, particularly with a compilation made by Krmer (19021903) in Samoa at the turn of the last century. The data indicate that while many of the same medicinal species are currently used as compared to a century ago, the uses are quite different, which indicates that there have been major changes in the way plants have been used medicinally in Samoa over the last century. The medicinal plants most commonly used today are Morinda citrifolia (Rubiaceae), Psychotria insularum (Rubiaceae), Curcuma longa (Zingiberaceae), Phymatosorus grossus (Polypodiaceae), Cordyline fruticosa (Agavaceae), Centella asiatica (Apiaceae), Rorippa sarmentosa (Brassicaceae), Zingiber officinale (Zingiberaceae), Vigna marina (Fabaceae), and Aloe vera (Agavaceae). About 30 species that may show medicinal promise in further studies are listed, along with the ailments they are used to treat.
23192277|The leaf anatomy of all genera of Olacaceae and of Erythropalum and Octoknema is described in detail, and a key to genera is provided. The Olacaceae show an estraordinary amount of leaf anatomical diversity which lends itself well for classification purposes. Decisive characters of taxonomic significance are: secretory cavities; laticifers; silicified mesophyll cells; vascular system of petiole and midrib; supporting sclerenchyma fibres and brachy-astrosclereids in petiole and midrib; stomatal type; lignification of guard cells; position of lumina in the guard cells and development of outer cuticular ledges; crystalliferous development. Varying characters such as occurrence and type of mesophyll sclereids, occurrence of silica bodies, and various crystal complements are of more restricted taxonomic value (i.e., mostly below the genus level). Based on different combinations of characters, nine groups can be distinguished. Two of these are represented by the single genera Erythropalum and Octoknema, which take isolated positions within the family, or for which family status (Erythropalaceae and Octoknemaceae) could be advocated. The other seven groups can be arranged in a system reflecting phylogenetic relationships. These groups show a fair degree of correlation with the traditional tribes recognised on macromorphological and ovule characters: Group I coincides with the tribe Couleae; Group II consists of the single genus Heisteria; Group III consists of Chaunochiton; Group IV comprises the tribes Aptandreae, Olaceae, and Ximenieae, as well as the genera Schoepfia, Malania, and Douradoa; Group V consists of Anacolosa, Phanerodiscus, and Cathedra, previously forming part of the Anacoloseae; Group VI, Scorodocarpus and Brachynema, was formerly also part of Anacoloseae, as well as Group VII, consisting of Strombosia, Strombosiopsis, Tetrastylidium, and Diogoa. The main new elements of this grouping are: the abolishment of subfamily boundaries; the artificial nature of the tribe Anacoloseae (group V is not closely related to groups VI and VII but rather to group IV); and the close links of Chaunochiton with groups IV and V rather than with Heisteria, with which it was formerly treated in the same tribe, the Heisterieae. The phylogenetic reconstruction of the Olacaceae based on cladistic methods is discussed in relation to data from wood anatomy, pollen, and ovule morphology and parasitism in the family. The specialised groups of the Olaceceae are clearly related to other santalalean families, notably Santalaceae, Loranthaceae, Misodendraceae, and Opiliaceae. The Olacaceae are a basic family within the Santalales, of which the wider affinities cannot be unambiguously established by leaf anatomy, but traditionally advocated links was Celastrales can be supported. On account of the pantropical, transpacific, or transatlantic distribution of most of the leaf anatomically recognised groups, it is argued that they must have differentiated before the breaking up of Gondwanaland, and that many of the leaf anatomical characters of individual Olacaceae are very conservative and date back to Cretaceous times.
23188994|Bauxite deposits in Hawaii have formed in place by processes that lead to extreme poverty of plant nutrients. Such deposits may be toxic to plants; but toxicities usually are less critical than nutritional deficiencies. Aluminum toxicity usually is not a major problem because the pH of gibbsitic soils is typically approximately 5.0. At that pH, the concentration of aluminum in soil solutions is low. If lower pH is encountered, amelioration of that problem is effected by applications of lime. The quantity of lime need not be great because buffering capacities are low at that pH. Of the numerous nutritional problems, phosphorus is usually the most limiting and the most expensive to correct in gibbsitic soils. In Hawaii, iron minerals rather than aluminum minerals are most responsible for phosphorus immobilization. Weathering and leaching have given rise to soils that have very little capacity to adsorb cation nutrients such as potassium and calcium. The parent rocks have been desilicated to the point of Si deficiency for grasses and sedges. In such an impoverished condition, even cyclic salts from the sea and tropospheric dust make significant contributions; however, for effective revegetation, massive applications of nutrients are required. If these are intelligently administered, bauxite spoils can be productive. In a moist tropical environment with abundant plant growth, organic matter rapidly accumulates, and a new soil develops in a few years.
23188167|Heliconia, a primarily neotropical genus, is represented in the Old World tropics by six species and five varieties. These taxa are distributed throughout the South Pacific region from Samoa and Fiji in the east to the Indonesian Moluccas in the west, including New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia. The paleotropical species, comprising subgen. Heliconiopsis, are distinguished from the New World species by primarily green cincinnal bracts, nocturnal anthesis, and large, red to orange fruits. Some of the species of subgen. Heliconiopsis (H. indica, H. papuana, H. solomonensis, and H. lanata) are pollinated by macroglossine bats. The indigenous uses of Heliconia in traditional life in the South Pacific include the employment of leaves as wrappers for food and covers for stone ovens. In addition, Old World heliconias have been important as ornamentals for over 100 years in Asia as well as Europe and the United States. One new subgenus is proposed: Heliconia subgen. Heliconiopsis; three new species and two new varieties are described: H. papuana, H. laufao, H. solomonensis, H. indica var. rubricarpa, and H. indica var. dennisiana; and three changes in rank are made: H. lanata, H. indica var. micholitzii, and H. indica var. austrocaledonica.
23188176|A survey of the Ecuadorian species of Columnea with a key to the 57 accepted species is presented, and their distribution is discussed. Eighteen species are newly described: Columnea albiflora, C. capillosa, C. cinerea, C. densibracteata, C. fililoba, C. fimbricalyx, C. fuscihirta, C. gigantifolia, C. inconspicua, C. laevis, C. lavandulacea, C. leucerinea, C. longinervosa, C. minutiflora, C. ovatifolia, C. purpurimarginata, C. rubribracteata, and C. rubricalyx. The segregate genera Pentadenia, Dalbergaria, and Trichantha and the small genus Bucinellina are included in Columnea, requiring three new names (C. elongatifolia for Trichantha angustifolia, C. flexiflora for Trichantha dodsonii, and C. tenella for Trichantha gracilis), and ten new combinations. In addition, Alloplectus microsepalus is transferred to Columnea. Five species are lectotypified and seven species are neotypified. These were for the most part described by Mansfeld based on material at Berlin and later destroyed. Nineteen Columnea species are known only from Ecuador, 32 Ecuadorian species also occur in Colombia, 11 occur in Peru, five in all three countries, and four in Panama, as well. Columnea microsepala and C. matudae have remarkable disjunctions, the first between coastal Ecuador and coastal Venezuela and the latter between southern Ecuador and southern Mexico. In Ecuador, 42 and 22 species occur west and east of the Andes mountains, respectively, and seven species occur on both sides. Nineteen species are only known from a single Ecuadorian province, but only five of these are endemic to Ecuador. The largest diversity exists in the most humid part of Ecuadorthe northwestern provinces of Carchi and Esmeraldas.
23190457|Two additional species are described in the Marquesan endemic genus Plakothira (Loasaceae): P. parviflora Florence from Fatu Hiva and P. perlmanii Florence from Nuku Hiva. A key to the genus is given and relationships of the species are discussed. A key to the Marquesan species of Melicope (Rutaceae) is given and two new species are described, M. hivaoaensis Florence and M. perlmanii Florence, both from Hiva Oa. A fourth species is described in the Eastern Polynesian genus Apetahia (Campanulaceae), A. seigelii Florence from Fatu Hiva. A key to Apetahia is given and its relationships to the closely related genus Sclerotheca are discussed.
23187398|After a taxonomic clarification and a review of the ethnobotanical data about kava, an attempt is made to elucidate the origin of this Oceanian plant. For this purpose, an ecogeographical survey of the genetic resources of the plant species Piper methysticum Forst. f. and P. wichmannii C. DC. was conducted throughout the Pacific. Local cultivars were collected from 42 different islands, planted in germplasm collections, and described. One hundred eighteen different kava cultivars were identified through morphological differentiation. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) on more than 200 root samples revealed the existence of various chemotypes. Analysis of quantity variation in kavalactone content was carried out by using cluster analysis and multifactorial analysis. Field trials of various cultivars indicated that the chemotype was not related to environmental factors or ontogeny, but to genotype. The lineage of the chemotypes suggested that P. wichmannii was the wild species from which farmers domesticated cultivars of P. methysticum.
23190456|The Marquesas Islands are one of the most isolated groups of oceanic islands, situated in the SE Pacific Ocean about 4850 km from the W coast of Mexico, the nearest continental region. This archipelago of 12 islands has a total surface area of 1300 sq. km. The islands range in size from 61.3 to 330 sq. km, in elevation from 360 to 1276 m, and in age from 1.3 My for Fatu Hiva to 6.3 My for Eiao. The indigenous vascular flora comprises ca. 320 species, with 42% being endemic. Floristic affinities are with the Society Islands, other Polynesian islands, the paleotropics, and to a lesser degree, the Hawaiian Archipelago and the neotropics. Human colonization, feral animals, and alien plants have severely impacted the low- to mid-elevation vegetation of the Marquesas. Nuku Hiva is herein used as an example for Marquesan vegetation types. Leeward areas below 300 m have relict patches of Sapindus-Xylosma dry forest and some remnants of Leptochloa grassland and Pisonia dry forest in the coastal regions. In leeward areas from 300 to 1000 m anthropogenic grasslands of Miscanthus, Paspalum, and Rhynchelytrum have been induced by fires and overgrazing. These latter associations have largely replaced native xerophytic shrublands of Malvaceae and Sterculiaceae. Low- to mid-elevation windward montane sites (300800 m) harbor moist and wet forest associations of Hibiscus, Angiopteris, and Pandanus. Mid- to upper elevation (8001000 m) sites usually support moist forest and wet forest formations with Metrosideros, Weinmannia, Hernandia, and Cyathea. The highest slopes and summits at and above ca. 1000 m have cloud forest and summit wet shrubland communities.
23190053|The phylogeny and taxonomy of the genus Acianthus (Orchidaceae, tribe Diurideae) were studied using a combination of morphologic, anatomic, molecular, and cladistic methods. One new species is described, A. halleanus. Two subgenera and five sections are recognized. The relationship of Acianthus to the other genera within the subtribe Acianthinae was investigated by comparing the anatomy and morphology of Acianthus species with representatives from Corybas, Stigmatodactylus, and Townsonia. Character evolution and geographic distributions are discussed for the subtribe Acianthinae and the genus Acianthus, and keys are provided to all infrageneric taxa within Acianthus. Species of Acianthus are diminutive, terrestrial herbs that arise from small, subglobose, subterranean root tubers. The genus is characterized by its single, well-developed, broad, membranaceous leaf blade with the veins anastomosing at the apex, a terminal, racemose inflorescence, the labellum disk with one or two calli at the base and a suprabasal, finely reticulate glandular region, and a pollinarium with either a single common viscidium or a pair of viscidia. Acianthus comprises 22 species distributed throughout portions of Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and the le des Pins. A cladistic study of the subtribe Acianthinae suggests a close relationship between Acianthus and Stigmatodactylus and a more distant affinity with Townsonia. Cyrtostylis, which has been regarded as a segregate genus, is given sectional rank here.
23192277|The leaf anatomy of all genera of Olacaceae and of Erythropalum and Octoknema is described in detail, and a key to genera is provided. The Olacaceae show an estraordinary amount of leaf anatomical diversity which lends itself well for classification purposes. Decisive characters of taxonomic significance are: secretory cavities; laticifers; silicified mesophyll cells; vascular system of petiole and midrib; supporting sclerenchyma fibres and brachy-astrosclereids in petiole and midrib; stomatal type; lignification of guard cells; position of lumina in the guard cells and development of outer cuticular ledges; crystalliferous development. Varying characters such as occurrence and type of mesophyll sclereids, occurrence of silica bodies, and various crystal complements are of more restricted taxonomic value (i.e., mostly below the genus level). Based on different combinations of characters, nine groups can be distinguished. Two of these are represented by the single genera Erythropalum and Octoknema, which take isolated positions within the family, or for which family status (Erythropalaceae and Octoknemaceae) could be advocated. The other seven groups can be arranged in a system reflecting phylogenetic relationships. These groups show a fair degree of correlation with the traditional tribes recognised on macromorphological and ovule characters: Group I coincides with the tribe Couleae; Group II consists of the single genus Heisteria; Group III consists of Chaunochiton; Group IV comprises the tribes Aptandreae, Olaceae, and Ximenieae, as well as the genera Schoepfia, Malania, and Douradoa; Group V consists of Anacolosa, Phanerodiscus, and Cathedra, previously forming part of the Anacoloseae; Group VI, Scorodocarpus and Brachynema, was formerly also part of Anacoloseae, as well as Group VII, consisting of Strombosia, Strombosiopsis, Tetrastylidium, and Diogoa.
