10.2307/3858253|Hundreds of lichen species are documented as textile dyes. Several periods of lichen depletion caused by historical dye manufacture are the basis of a modern ethical issue. The question has been complicated by confusing dye formulas and dye names. Solutions are to clarify methods, and to educate dyers and lichenologists as to other aspects of the ethical issue.
10.2307/3858252|Birds were surveyed at log landings and forest/clearcut borders in the hardwood forest type of the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) of New Hampshire during the breeding seasons of 1989 and 1990 to examine the possibility of log landings functioning as wildlife openings. Few differences were found in composition of breeding bird assemblages between log landings and forest/clearcut borders. Several bird species typical of early successional forest were found at log landings after they no longer appeared in the adjacent clearcuts. Overall, log landings serve as a temporal and spatial extension of the early successional habitat provided by clearcutting. The number of bird species increased with increasing area of log landing, but the increase leveled off at about 0.21 ha (0.52 acre). Per unit area, both the number of bird species and the total number of individuals was greatest at intermediate area (0.14-0.21 ha) log landings. None of the observed bird species appeared to require larger openings. The eastern kingbird, the "official" indicator species of wildlife openings in the WMNF, was not observed on log landings, but log landings precisely fulfill the intended objective of wildlife openings in the WMNF. The eastern kingbird should not be considered the management indicator of wildlife openings.
10.2307/3858170|We used three years of shorebird data from an on-going study of seasonal occurrence of birds at Biddeford Pool, Maine to demonstrate the importance of this area to populations of shorebirds migrating through Maine. The study area, which consisted of a variety of coastal habitats, regularly hosted 19 species of shorebirds, predominantly during fall migration. The most abundant species were semipalmated sandpipers (Calidris pusilla), and black-bellied plovers (Pluvialis squatarola), accounting for 52% of all shorebirds counted. Maximum counts of over 900 shorebirds were recorded. The most important areas to shorebirds were the intertidal flats adjacent to Mile Stretch Road.
10.2307/3858211|The striped bass (Morone saxatilis) has been an important food and sport fish in the Gulf of Maine since colonial times. Fisheries biologists have worked to preserve the stocks of this fish by protecting its breeding grounds in Chesapeake Bay, where 90 percent of the striped bass in the waters of the northeastern United States breed. A look at the historical records, indicates that this was not the only breeding ground for striped bass, but rather that they, at one time, spawned in almost every river on the New England coast. Diaries, treatises and town histories hold a wealth of knowledge about the plenitude of striped bass and the importance of the fishery to the colonies and the states of New England until the end of the nineteenth century. Perhaps the key to the protection of striped bass stocks lies in the restoration of them to their old breeding grounds.
10.2307/3858220|Tadpoles of a number of species of frogs and toads have been observed to recognize and preferentially associate with siblings. Kin recognition, which involves the identification of waterborne chemical cues, occurs predominantly in species that form social aggregations of tadpoles. Individuals in social groups comprised of siblings may have higher inclusive fitness (the combined fitness from personal reproductive success and the reproductive success of kin) than individuals in mixed kin groups. Sibling groups may enjoy higher fitness through the effects of increased growth rates, increased vigilance for predators, advantages in competition for resources, and greater flexibility in times of resource scarcity. This paper reviews the literature addressing the phenomenon of kin recognition in tadpoles.
10.2307/3858249|Lichens have been used to make dyes for more than 3,500 years. There are two methods: the ammonia method (AM dyes) and the boiling water method (BWM dyes). The first documented ammonia method lichen dye was orchil. Made from lichens of the genus Roccella, this important trade commodity was developed by the Phoenicians. Extensive use of lichens as domestic and industrial dyes by ancient Mediterranean civilizations, and by Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, and Norse peoples in Medieval and Renaissance Europe, led to several periods of historical lichen depletion. Popular dye genera affected included Evernia, Lasallia, Lobaria, Ochrolechia, Parmelia, Pseudevernia, Roccella, and Umbilicaria. This depletion caused by the over-harvesting of lichens for dyeing is the basis of the modern ethical issue: should lichens continue to be used for craft dyes?
10.2307/3858194|Rock gunnels, Pholis gunnellus, were collected intertidally along the central and eastern coasts of Maine, 1979-1991. The species is seasonally absent in Maine, moving to subtidal waters in winter. Homing or retention within an isolated intertidal area appears to be limited, with only 11% of the fishes (4 individuals) recaptured on subsequent days at a study area near Schoodic Peninsula. Invasion of protective rock crevices by unmarked fishes was high, with 69% of the favored habitat (11 of 16 rocks) inhabited by new fishes within the first 40 days. Most recaptures were within two days of marking, but one fish was recaptured after 23 days, and another after 685 days. Although homing appears in evidence, the availability of acceptable rock crevices may play a major role in the reappearance of individual fish in a specific intertidal area. Shifts in intertidal density of rock gunnels may indicate a broader, subtidal distribution, interspersed with short-term habitation of intertidal areas.
10.2307/3858250|The life cycle of the meningeal worm of deer Parelaphostrongylus tenuis is described. Its relationship as a causal agent in "moose sickness" is discussed as well as its possible role as a regulator of moose populations.
10.2307/3858179| A Maine virgin red spruce and northern hardwoods stand was documented by a US Forest Service employee in 1902 prior to cutting. In this stand, spruce averaged 13.5 (34 cm) diameter at breast height (dbh). Only 22 trees per acre (54.3/ha) exceeded 15 (38 cm) dbh. Red spruce seedlings in the understory of a nearby stand that had previously been partially cut took as long as 38 years to reach 3 ft (0.9 m) in height. The average dbh of red spruce in Piscataquis County in 1982 was 8 (20 cm). Growth rates achieved in stands measured in 1902 suggest that managed stands can be grown that would resemble the structure of this virgin stand. 
10.2307/3858181|Evergreen and deciduous leaves exhibit distinct advantages and disadvantages in certain habitats. Climatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions all affect whether the evergreen or deciduous condition will prevail in woody vegetation. In some areas of the world, evergreen and deciduous vegetation types grow in distinct broad bands. In other areas, both types of plants grow together. Which type grows where is dependent on how physical conditions affect the interrelated factors of photosynthetic capacity, nutrient availability, and winter desiccation.
10.2307/3858180|Black limestone floor tiles in the Maine State Capitol contain the fossilized remains of a variety of marine invertebrates. Fossiliferous limestone was first installed in the Capitol by the architect John C. Spofford during construction of the Capitol's west wing from 1889 to 1890. Additional fossil bearing limestone was installed by the architect G. Henri Desmond during an extensive remodeling and renovation of the original Capitol building from 1909 to 1911. The composition and fossil content of the stone is consistent with the carbonaceous limestone of the Middle Ordovician Crown Point Formation at Isle La Motte, Vermont. Quarries at Isle La Motte have been providing dimension limestone for architectural purposes for more than 200 years and are the most likely source for the fossiliferous building stones of the State Capitol.
10.2307/3858236|Although Nova Scotia's rare coastal plain plant species are now among the most endangered plants in Canada they remained little more than a curiosity until the early 1980s. Renewed scientific interest and research since that time has shown that the species, while sometimes locally abundant, are extremely limited in their distribution and are vulnerable to ecosystem changes. Their requirement for widespread protective mechanisms, including the protection of all available populations if they are to remain viable, has been the subject of several governmental and non-governmental efforts. This paper discusses ongoing attempts to conserve and protect these endangered species and concludes with a discussion of future needs and opportunities.
10.2307/3858221|Needles of Taxus canadensis from Maine are reported to contain nearly five times more taxol than the bark of the average western yew, Taxus brevifolia. All yews contain some taxol, the recently approved drug for ovarian cancer. Taxol shows promise with regard to many other types of cancer and is of special interest because nearly 300,000 American lives are lost each year to cancer. In the extraction process for taxol, energy ethanol can be produced as a co-product along with other useful phytochemicals.
10.2307/3858155|We monitored individual plants of winterberry (Ilex verticillata), highbush cranberry (Viburnum opulus), wild lily-of-the-valley (Maianthemum canadense), and partridgeberry (Mitchella repens) during two reproductive seasons to measure the disappearance of fruits (presumably removed by fruit-eating animals) in plant species whose fruits ripen in early fall but persist through the winter. Patterns of fruit removal were variable between species, individuals, and years, but in general removal rates for all species were slow and relatively constant. Only Ilex fruits showed visible deterioration during the winter. Exclosures placed around Maianthemum plants in the field and preliminary feeding trials suggested that mice (Peromyscus sp.) and other small mammals may remove most fruits and disperse many viable seeds of Maianthemum, as well as other low-growing plants with persistent fruits, such as Mitchella.
10.2307/3858153|Identification of mice of the genus Peromyscus by genetic markers at the salivary amylase locus revealed two previously unidentified populations of deer mice, P. maniculatus Wagner, from southern Maine. White-footed mice, P. leucopus Rafinsque, were identified from several localities east of the Penobscot River and were also found on two islands (Deer Isle and Matinicus Island) where previous surveys had only reported deer mice. Although some of these populations of P. leucopus may represent relic populations of some earlier colonization, most appear to be the result of an eastward expansion of P. leucopus since 1950.
10.2307/3858193|Six species of the lichen genus Xanthoria occur in Maine (candelaria, elegans, fallax, parietina, polycarpa, and sorediata), and these are described in detail and illustrated with color photographs. Xanthoria cfr. papillifera also occurs in Maine; it is treated provisionally as a variant of X. elegans. A key to the six accepted species is presented and their distribution in Maine shown on maps. Four new inland stations for X. parietina are reported, all on Populus spp.; X. sorediata is reported for the first time in Maine.
10.2307/3858219|Colored photographs with short captions are furnished for several taxa of cantharelloid fungi. In addition, a check list of thirteen species reported for Maine and a dichotomous key to the cantharelloid genera are given.
10.2307/3858251|Larvae of caridean shrimp in plankton tows from Sheepscot Bay, Maine, were monitored from 1979 through 1984 and in 1989. Twelve species in three families were collected: (1) Hippolytidae: Caridion gordoni, Eualus fabricii, E. pusiolus, Lebbeus groenlandicus, L. polaris, L. microceros, and Spirontocaris spinus; (2) Pandalidae: Dichelopandalus leptocerus, Pandalus borealis, and P. montagui; (3) Crangonidae: Crangon septemspinosa and Sabinea septemcarinata. An illustrated key for identification of the first stage larvae of each species is presented. The larger and usually less abundant larval species occurred primarily during winter into spring, whereas the smaller species occurred during all months and at the greatest densities. At midday the greatest concentration of all species was between 15 and 25 m water depth.
10.2307/3858237|The bird community of a spruce fir forest stand in Maine's Baxter State Park changed in response to habitat disruption caused by a severe spruce budworm outbreak. Between 1982 and 1987, species adapted to foraging or nesting in mature softwoods declined while those adapted to disturbance and early successional stages increased. Since 1987, habitat changes have occurred more slowly and have resulted in fewer noticeable changes in the bird community.
10.2307/3858239|This paper reports on a 1992 survey of the terrestrial mammals of Isle Au Haut. Six traplines were run, and trails, streams, and gravel roads were searched for mammal sign. This paper is the first written documentation of the eastern coyote (Canis latrans) on Isle Au Haut. It reports the new discovery of the red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) on Isle Au Haut, and reviews its presence on other islands in Penobscot Bay. Most mammals previously seen on Isle Au Haut were detected with the exception of the river otter (Lutra canadensis) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). The deer tick (Ixodes dammini) was found on three deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) on the eastern side of the island.
