10.2307/3984309|The fifteen most important American crops are, in order of farm value: corn, soybean, alfalfa, wheat, cotton, tobacco, sorghum, potatoes, oranges, rice, tomatoes, peanuts, oats, barley, and sugarbeet. An inquiry into the sources of germ plasm shows that the genetic foundation of each crop grown in the U.S. (except corn) can be traced to only a few introductions. Modern corns were generated in situ from indigenous materials. In several cases, a single plant selection played a major role in the parentage of a major crop. Narrow genetic bases have been characteristic of American agriculture. Some of the critical introductions came from centers of genetic diversity or centers of origin, but most of them did not. Genetic resources are needed today as sources of resistance to diseases and pests, as sources of new cytoplasms, to improve nutritional quality, to modify plant architectures for higher yields or lower-cost production, to improve resistance to stress, to modify breeding systems, to broaden genetic bases, and to improve adaptation and yield. The flow of exotic germ plasm into our breeding programs is critically important but is hindered unnecessarily by inadequate collections. Genetic erosion around the world and our failure to sample these resources before they disappear pose a more serious threat to American agriculture than the present genetic vulnerability of our major crops.
