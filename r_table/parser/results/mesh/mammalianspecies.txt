It occurs in northwestern Canada and Alaska, where it inhabits well-drained tundra and extends into subalpine and alpine regions. It is unique among arvicolines in that it not only hoards underground but also constructs haypiles above ground. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.
