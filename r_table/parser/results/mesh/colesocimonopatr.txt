4153167|The fossil record of scarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) is reviewed and its relevance for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the taxon is explored. After a discussion of the different kinds of preservation of scarab fossils, including preservation of color, the richest scarab deposits are identified. From the fossil record, the minimum age of Scarabaeoidea is determined as 152 myr. To develop an idea about the appearance of the first scarab, the ground-pattern of Scarabaeoidea is reconstructed for the first time on the basis of published phylogenetic analyses. Extinct scarabaeoid family-group taxa are described and discussed. Cretocomini and Cretoglaphyrini are upgraded to subfamily rank for reasons of consistency. Most of their diagnostic character states are controverted or not polarized. The minimum age of extant scarabaeoid family-group taxa is deduced from the fossil record. Ancient feeding habits, particularly the development of coprophagy, are discussed. The youngest extinct species described are from the Pleistocene, whereas extant species have been recorded since the Pliocene.
4153162|Dung beetles employ numerous behavioral strategies to sequester dung away from other insects, and these have been broadly grouped into two categories: species that dig tunnels beneath the dung (tunnelers) and species that roll dung on the surface of the soil (rollers). Many species also are armed with rigid exoskeletal outgrowths called horns. Horns function as weapons, and horn sizes can be extreme. One widespread pattern within dung beetles is that tunneling species often have horns, whereas rolling species almost always do not, suggesting that residing (and fighting) inside tunnels at the dung deposition site may be an important ecological prerequisite for the evolution of horns in dung beetles. Here, we test explicitly for an historical association between tunneling behavior and the evolution of horns using a recent phylogeny for the scarabaeine dung beetles. We show that all eight of the independent gains of horns included in our analyses occurred on branches of the phylogeny reconstructed as tunneling, and that one of the three evolutionary losses of horns occurred on a branch that had lost tunneling behavior. We interpret this as evidence for a biologically meaningful association between tunneling behavior and the evolution of enlarged or exaggerated weapons such as horns, supporting the ideas of Eberhard and others that beetle horns may be most "beneficial" when used within the confines of restricted spaces such as burrows or tunnels.
4153161|We present a preliminary overview of our molecular phylogenetics research on the superfamily Scarabaeoidea. The molecular data consists of 28S ribosomal DNA sequences (mainly D2 and D3 expansion regions) for over 600 taxa and 18S ribosomal DNA sequences (mainly E17 to E35 expansion regions) for over 150 representative taxa within the lineages sampled. Based on our preliminary molecular phylogenetic results, Scarabaeoidea includes three major groups: 1) Geotrupidae, Passalidae, and Pleocomidae; 2) Lucanidae, Diphyllostomatidae, Trogidae, and Glaresidae; and 3) Hybosoridae, Ochodaeidae, Glaphyridae, and Scarabaeidae. The broad evolutionary patterns within the Scarabaeoidea are discussed with respect to phylogeny and evolution.
4153168|For the first time, all family-group names in the superfamily Scarabaeoidea (Coleoptera) are evaluated using the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature to determine their availability and validity. A total of 383 family-group names were found to be available, and all are reviewed to scrutinize the correct spelling, author, date, nomenclatural availability and validity, and current classification status. Numerous corrections are given to various errors that are commonly perpetuated in the literature. A reversal of precedence is used to preserve the prevailing usage of the following family-group names: Eupariini Schmidt, 1910 (over Ataeniini Harold, 1868); Pachydemini Burmeister, 1855 (over Elaphocerini Blanchard, 1851); Heterosternina Bates, 1888 (over Macropnina Horn, 1866); and Anomalina Streubel, 1839 (over Euchlorina Hope, 1839).
4153149| The genus Epectinaspis Blanchard (Rutelinae: Anomalini) is revised and now includes nine species. Species in the genus occur from southern Mexico to northern Venezuela. One new species, E. bisyrica, is described. Five species names are considered synonyms: E. gracilipes Casey and E. nubicollis Casey are new synonyms of E. mexicana (Burmeister); E. quadripennis Casey and Zabacana brevinigrans Saylor (Melolonthinae) are new synonyms of E. moreletiana (Blanchard); and E. densicollis Casey is a new synonym of E. opacicollis Bates. Lectotype specimens are designated herein for the following species names: E. ambigens Bates, E. boucardi Nonfried, E. chalconota Bates, E. chelifera Bates, E. densicollis Casey, E. guatemalensis Ohaus, E. moreletiana (Blanchard), E. nubicollis, E. opacicollis Bates, E. pictipennis Bates, and E. quadripennis. A neotype was designated for E. mexicana (Burmeister). Phylogenetic analysis of Epectinaspis species was conducted, and relationships with other genera of Anomalini are discussed. The genus Epectinaspis was shown to be paraphyletic; one species belonged to an undescribed anomaline lineage. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the new genus Balanogonia (Rutelinae: Anomalini) is created. Epectinaspis freudei Frey is transferred to Balanogonia (becoming a new combination) and a new species, B. constricta, is described. Balanogonia is added to the generic key of New World Anomalini. Natural history, biogeography, and an illustrated key to species of Epectinaspis are included.

4153164|Invertebrate focal taxa that can act as information surrogates for broader patterns of biodiversity are of increasing interest to conservation practitioners. Scarabaeine dung beetles have been widely proposed as an ideal group for biodiversity inventory and monitoring, they satisfy all of the criteria of an ideal focal taxon, and they have already been used in ecological research and biodiversity survey and conservation work in many regions of the world. Here I review the characteristics that make the Scarabaeinae suitable for this purpose and suggest future directions for the broader use of this group as a focal taxon.
40388848|Nesocyrtosoma Marcuzzi is revised and many long-standing taxonomic problems are resolved. There are a total of 45 species in the genus Nesocyrtosoma, 27 of them are newly described herein (N bestiola n. sp., N. neibaense n. sp., N. scabrosum n. sp., N. lacrima n. sp., N. simplex n. sp., N. altagracia n. sp., N. basilense n. sp., N. dolosum n. sp., N. purpureum n. sp., N. crenulatum n. sp., N. otus n. sp., N. darlingtoni n. sp., N mutabile n. sp., N. larseni n. sp., N. bankense n. sp., N fernandoi n. sp., N. garridoi n. sp., N. puertoricense n. sp., N serration n. sp., N skelleyi n. sp., N nearnsi n. sp., N. productum n. sp., N. teresitae n. sp., N curvum n. sp., N guerreroi n. sp., N. dentatum n. sp. and f AT. minisculum n. sp.). Lectotypes are designated for Cnodalon elongatus Zayas, Cnodalon parallelus Zayas, Cnodalon tumefaction Zayas, Cnodalon turquinensis Zayas, Cnodalon inflation Zayas and Cnodalon trinitatis Zayas. Cnodalon trinitatis Zayas is synonymized with Cyrtosoma (Nesocyrtosoma) inflatum Marcuzzi n. syn. Cnodalon inflation Zayas is synonymized with Cyrtosoma (Nesocyrtosoma) tumefaction Marcuzzi n. syn. Cyrtosoma (Nesocyrtosoma) gebieni Marcuzzi is recognized for the first time as Nesocyrtosoma gebieni (Marcuzzi) n. comb. Cnodalon turquinensis Zayas, Cnodalon cuproso Zayas and Cnodalon elongatus Zayas are placed in Nesocyrtosoma and recognized as Nesocyrtosoma turquinense (Zayas) n. comb., Nesocyrtosoma cuprosum (Zayas) n. comb, and Nesocyrtosoma elongatum (Zayas) n. comb. Cyrtosoma (Nesocyrtosoma) ferruginea Garrido and Gutierrez is recognized as Nesocyrtosoma ferruginea (Garrido and Gutierrez) n. comb. Cyrtosoma (Pachycyrtosoma) Marcuzzi is synonymized with Nesocyrtosoma n. syn. Cyrtosoma (Pachycyrtosoma) merkli Marcuzzi is recognized as Nesocyrtosoma merkli (Marcuzzi) n. comb., and Cyrtosoma (Pachycyrtosoma) hispaniolae Marcuzzi is recognized as Nesocyrtosoma hispaniolae (Marcuzzi) n. comb. Serrania Garrido is synonymized with Nesocyrtosoma n. syn. Serrania viridula (Zayas) is synonymized with Platydema virens LaPorte and Brull n. syn., and is recognized as Nesocyrtosoma virens (LaPorte and Brull) n. comb. Apsida cubanensis (Kulzer) is placed in Nesocyrtosoma as Nesocyrtosoma cubanense (Kulzer) n. comb. All but two of the 18 previously known species of Nesocyrtosoma are redescribed, comparative descriptions of all species and species-groups are provided, all but three species are illustrated, distribution maps are presented, and a key to all species is supplied. A phylogenetic analysis is conducted to test the monophyly of Nesocyrtosoma. Finally, a review of Antillean biogeography and the biogeographic distribution of Nesocyrtosoma are discussed.
4153165|The use of scarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) by primarily pre- and non-industrial peoples throughout the world is reviewed. These uses consist of (1) religion and folklore, (2) folk medicine, (3) food, and (4) regalia and body ornamentation. The use of scarabs in religion or cosmology, once widespread in ancient Egypt, exists only rarely today in other cultures. Scarabs have a minor role in folk medicine today although they may have been more important in the past. The predominant utilization of these beetles today, and probably in the past as well, is as food with emphasis on the larval stage. Lastly, particularly large or brightly colored scarabs (or their parts) are used (mostly in the New World) to adorn the body or as regalia.
4153152| The status of the subtribes of Scaphisomatini was examined by a cladistic analysis of 47 terminal taxa and 110 adult characters. Based on 57 parsimonious trees and pruned data sets that excluded enigmatic taxa we demonstrated that the scaphisomatine subtribes are paraphyletic. All pre-existing subtribes are synonymized under Scaphisomatini. Although several monophyletic groups are supported, none are attributed subtribal status. Six genera are described as new: Tritoxidium new genus (type species: Toxidium indicum Achard), Bertiscapha new genus with three new species (type species: Bertiscapha compacta n. sp.; B. burlischi n. sp., B. striata n. sp.), Sphaeroscapha new genus (type species: Pseudobironium globosum Lbl), Kasibaeocera new genus (type species: Baeocera mussardi Lbl), Spinoscapha new genus (type species: Brachynopus rufus (Broun)), Vickibella new genus (type species: Brachynopus apicellus (Broun)). A new species of Kathetopodium Lbl is described (K. kiunganum new species). Synonymies are as follows: Vituratella Reitter (=Antongilium Pic, 25 new combinations; =Mysthrix Champion, two new combinations; =Termitotoxidium Pic, one new combination; =Trichoscaphella Reitter, one new combination), Scaphobaeocera Csiki (=Baeotoxidium Lbl; seven new combinations); Scaphisoma Leach (=Caryoscapha Ganglbauer; four new combinations; =Macroscaphosoma Lbl; two new combinations). Toxidium mauritianum Vinson is transferred to Xotidium Lbl. A key to the world genera of Scaphisomatini is included. Myxomycete feeding evolved once, or twice, though lack of natural history data compromises reconstructions of ancestral nodes due to unknown character states. Termitophily has evolved once in the Baeoceridium group, a monophyletic group that is sympatric with macrotermitine termites that cultivate fungi in the Old World. A laterally compressed body form evolved several times and may be associated with moving through pre-existing spaces in leaf litter and rotting wood. Having the meso- and metacoxal-trochanteral articulations perched at a medial position in the body of laterally compressed taxa allows for leg movements through more horizontal planes relative to the position of the body. The prothoracic corbiculum, a feature unique to Scaphisomatini, evolved repeatedly in the tribe and does not appear to be correlated with natural history traits. The corbiculum is derived from tracheal tissue and may be used in respiration or water retention. 
4153146|The Neotropical genus Cryptocanthon Balthasar (Scarabaeinae: Canthonini) is revised. Diagnoses, descriptions and a key to the 35 species are presented, including 22 new species: C. bochilae, C. howdeni, C. montebello, C. ocosingo and C. rayonensis from Mexico; C. osaensis and C. solisi from Costa Rica; C. denticulum and C. lobipygus from Panama; C. escobari, C. foveatus, C. medinae and C. pumilus from Colombia; C. andersoni, C. gilli and C. punctatus from Venezuela; C. galbao from French Guiana; C. curticrinus, C. genieri, C. napoensis, C. otonga and C. urguensis from Ecuador. All of the known species of Cryptocanthon are inhabitants of wet forest litter. A phylogenetic hypothesis and biogeographical discussion are included. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, four species groups were established: a northern South America relict species group, an Amazonian-Guianan lowland species group, a middle American species group, and a northern Andean species group. The diversity and level of endemicity of Cryptocanthon is consistent with other small-sized scarab beetles.
41412386|The New Zealand endemic rove beetle genus Agnosthaetus Bernhauer, 1939 is revised. Thirty-four species are recognized and the following 28 new species are described: Agnosthaetus chiasma Clarke, Agnosthaetus rodmani Clarke, Agnosthaetus falx Clarke, Agnosthaetus stenomastax Clarke, Agnosthaetus hetewmastax Clarke, Agnosthaetus tumidus Clarke, Agnosthaetus aequalis Clarke, Agnosthaetus akatarawa Clarke, Agnosthaetus zonatus Clarke, Agnosthaetus bicolor Clarke, Agnosthaetus impressus Clarke, Agnosthaetus nitidus Clarke, Agnosthaetus leviceps Clarke, Agnosthaetus ecarinatus Clarke, Agnosthaetus imitator Clarke, Agnosthaetus aorangi Clarke, Agnosthaetus orongo Clarke, Agnosthaetus minutus Clarke, Agnosthaetus lanceolatus Clarke, Agnosthaetus kaikoura Clarke, Agnosthaetus thayerae Clarke, Agnosthaetus newtoni Clarke, Agnosthaetus truncatus Clarke, Agnosthaetus sculptus Clarke, Agnosthaetus nunni Clarke, Agnosthaetus carnelius Clarke, Agnosthaetus enigmus Clarke, and Agnosthaetus affinis Clarke. Agnosthaetus bwunides Newton, new name, is proposed as a replacement name for the type species Agnosthaetus brouni Bernhauer (junior secondary homonym), in light of T. Broun's apparently valid description of Agnosthaetus brouni (Broun), new combination. Lectotypes are designated for Agnosthaetus cariniceps Bernhauer and A. brouni (Broun). Detailed and revised diagnoses and descriptions of both adults and presumed third instars are provided, including the first comprehensive larval description for the subfamily Euaesthetinae. According to the current suprageneric classification, Agnosthaetus is placed in the tribe Stenaesthetini based on the 5-5-4 tarsal formula and an immarginate abdomen. The monophyly of the genus is yet to be tested, but all known species share the following apparently unique characters: 1) distinctly ovate or crescentic dorsal tentorial sulci; 2) glandular pit on adorai surface of labrum; 3) sclerotized labial spines; 4) posteriorly directed corporotentorial arms; 5) mesocoxal internal apophysis; and 6) a dorsal branch arising from the metendosternal arms. The species are comparatively rarely collected, but may be found in a broad range of habitats, mostly forest leaf litter, where they are most efficiently collected by sifting.
4541506|The genus Akalyptoischion Andrews is revised to include 24 species, 16 of which are new. A taxonomic treatment of the genus is provided including a morphological study, new species descriptions, keys, illustrations, and notes on the distribution and biology of Akalyptoischion. The following species are included: A. anasillos Andrews, USA, CA; A. atrichos Andrews, USA, CA; A. bathytrematos new species, Mexico, Baja California; A. chandleri Andrews, USA, AZ; A. delotretos new species, USA, CA, NV; A. diadeletron new species, USA, OR, ID; A. dyskritos new species, USA, UT; A. echinos new species, USA, CA; A. gigas new species, USA, CA; A. giulianii Andrews, USA, CA; A. hadromorphus new species, USA, CA; A. heptalocos new species, Mexico, Baja California; A. heterotrichos new species, USA, CA; A. hormathos Andrews, USA, CA; A. lasiosus new species, USA, CA; A. leptosoma new species, USA, CA; A. parechinos new species, USA, CA; A. pogonias new species, USA, CA; A. polytremetron new species, USA, AZ; A. prionotus new species, USA, CA; A. quadrifoveolata (Fall), USA, CA; A. sleeperi Andrews, USA, CA; A. texas new species, USA, TX; A. tomeus Andrews, USA, CA.
4153155|The salpingid subfamily Dacoderinae is revised for the Western Hemisphere. A key to species and phylogenetic analysis are provided for the world fauna. The genus Dacoderus LeConte includes D. striaticeps LeConte, D. acanthomma Blair, D. sleeperi new species (Southwest US and Mexico), D. steineri new species (Texas), D. werneri new species (Mexico), and D. rossi new species (Costa Rica and Mexico). A new genus Myrmecoderus is described to include species M. dominicensis (Horn), M. laevipennis (Horn) new combinations, and M. rileyi new species (southern Mexico). The higher classification of the subfamily and genera is discussed. Hypothesized phylogenetic considerations among genera, including the Australian genus Tretothorax, and species are examined utilizing cladistic methodology. The distribution and biology of the subfamily and genera are briefly discussed.
40983020|The checkered beetle genera Acanthocollum Opitz and Stegnociava Opitz are redescribed and the genus Ichnea Laporte is revised for the first time. The monotypic genus Acanthocollum contains A. melanurum (Klug). Stegnociava includes one previously described species, S. fumigata (Gorham), and two species describe herein, S. velatis Opitz, new species, and S. zorropsis Opitz, new species. Ichnea is comprised of 14 previously described species and five new species. The previously described species are I. aequinoctialis Spinola, I. aterrima (Klug), I. digna Wolcott, I. dimidiatipennis Spinola, I. divisa (Chevrolat), I. frenata (Erichson), I. incerta Gorham, I. lycoides Laporte, I. marginella (Klug), I. mimica Gorham, I. opaca (Klug), I. plumbea Gorham, I. praeusta (Klug), and I. procera Schenkung. The species of Ichnea described herein are I. acanthomelina Opitz, new species, I. atra Opitz, new species, I. callanga Opitz, new species, I. gregata Opitz, new species, and I. gremia Opitz, new species. Seventeen new synonymies are designated: I. aequinoctialis (= l. funesta Gorham, I. histrica Gorham, I. spinolai Corporaal); I. aterrima (= I. mexicana Thomson, I. religiosa Chevrolat, I. vitticollis Kuweit, I. kuwerti Lohde, I. elongata Knull); I. frenata (= I. disjuncta Gorham, I. panamensis Gorham, I. subfasciata Gorham, I. mitella Gorham, I. striaticollis Kuwert, I. confluens Kuwert); I. marginella (Klug) (= Enoplium laterale Klug, Hylecoetus cylindricus Germar); I. plumbea Gorham (= I. helvolicollis Corporaal). The species of Acanthocollum characterized by having a ridge of golden yellow setae on the upper sides of the pronotum. Species of Stegnociava have the antennal funicle extensively compacted, and in species of Ichnea the distal margin of the pygidium shows a distinct triangular, depigmented mark. Like other epiphloeines, species of Acanthocollum, Stegnociava, and Ichnea are thought to be predators of lignicolous insects and highly involved in Batesian polymorphism. Two major lines of evolution are apparent within Ichnea, one having evolved toward a lycid type of body form, whereas the other progressed towards a lampyroid configuration. Twenty-one characters were evaluated phylogenetically and analyzed with WINCLADA, in coordination with NONA, to generate a nearly completely resolved species-group level phylogeny. It is postulated that the progenitor of the three genera evolved in South America, with subsequent ancestral stocks extending into Central America following the closure of the Panamanian portal. Se re-describen los gneros de Cleridae Acanthocollum Opitz y Stegnociava Opitz y el gnero Ichnea Laporte es revisado por primera vez. El gnero monotpico Acanthocollum incluye a A. melanurum (Klug). Stegnociava contiene una especie descrita anteriormente, S. fumigata (Gorham), y dos especies descritas aqu, S. velatis Opitz, nueva especie, y S. zorropsis Opitz, nueva especie. Ichnea comprende 14 especies descritas anteriormente y cinco especies nuevas. Las especies ya descritas son I. aequinoctialis Spinola, I. aterrima (Klug), I. digna Wolcott, I. dimidiatipennis Spinola, I. divisa (Chevrolat), I. frenata (Erichson), I. incerta Gorham, I. lycoides Laporte, I. marginella (Klug), I. mimica Gorham, I. opaca (Klug), I. plumbea Gorham, I. praeusta (Klug), e I. procera Schenkung. Las especies de Ichnea que se describen aqu son I. acanthomelina Opitz, nueva especie, I. atra Opitz, nueva especie, I. callanga Opitz, nueva especie, I. gregata Opitz, nueva especie, e I. gremia Opitz, nueva especie. Diez y siete nuevas sinonomas son: I. aequinoctialis (= I. funesta Gorham, I. histrica Gorham, I. spinolai Corporaal); I. aterrima (= I. mexicana Thomson, I. religiosa Chevrolat, I. vitticollis Kuwert, I. kuwerti Lohde, I. elongata Knull); I. frenata (= I. disjuncta Gorham, I. panamensis Gorham, I. subfasciata Gorham, I. mitella Gorham, I. striaticollis Kuwert, I. confluens Kuwert); I. marginella (Klug) (= Enoplium laterale Klug, Hylecoetus cylindricus Germar); I. plumbea Gorham (= I. helvolicollis Corporaal). Las especies de Acanthocollum se caracterizan por tener una cresta de setas doradas en los lados superiores del pronoto. Las especies de Stegnociava tienen el funculo de la antena muy reducido, y en las especies de Ichnea el margen distal del pigidio presenta una distinta marca triangular y despigmentada. Como otros miembros de Epiphloeinae, se piensan que las especies de Acanthocollum, Stegnociava, e Ichnea son depredadores de insectos ligncolos y que estn altamente envueltos en polimorfismos Batesianos. Aparentemente hay dos lneas mayores de evolucin en Ichnea, una que evolucion usando un modelo de Lycidae como forma del cuerpo, mientras que la otra progres usando un modelo de Lampyridae. Se evaluaron 21 carcteres filogenticamente y se analizaron con WINCLADA, en coordinacin con NONA, para generar un rbol filogentico casi completamente resuelto. Se postula que el progenitor de los tres gneros evolucion en Sudamrica, con subsecuentes ancestros extendindose en Centroamrica con el cierre del portal panameo.
4153160|A historic analysis of the classification of Scarabaeoidea is presented. The analysis comprises a historic comparison of the type and number of characters of the genera and their grouping into higher-level taxa. The analysis is divided into three time periods, including a review of 70 publications on scarab systematics (beginning with Linnaeus). The first period (1735-1858) encompasses an era prior to the publication of Darwin's "The Origin of Species", and it is, therefore, a classification process arguably free of any evolutionary influences. The second period (1859-1949) includes a comparative synthesis on the classification of the Scarabaeoidea based on faunistic and taxonomic works. The third period (1950-2006) summarizes and analyzes classifications influenced by phylogenetic theories and is based on monographs, faunal studies, keys for regional fauna, papers on comparative morphology, and studies specifically devoted to the understanding of evolutionary relationships and processes in the Scarabaeoidea. A large problem concerning the classification and phylogeny still remains because most studies do not consider all the diversity of the Scarabaeoidea in a single analysis.
29739241|The widespread leiodid genus Agyrtodes Portevin is revised. All known species are redescribed and illustrated, and the following new species are described: A. flaviceps Seago, A. globosus Seago, A. monteithi Seago, A. newtoni Seago, A. variabilis Seago (all from Australia, northern Queensland), and A. lescheni Seago (New Zealand, South Island). A lectotype is designated for Mesocolon varius Broun, a previously-recognized junior synonym of A. nebulosus (Broun). Agyrtodes disparatus Szymczakowski is synonymized with A. monticola (Broun). Agyrtodes is expanded to include species without a lacinial spore-brush, as this otherwise diagnostic character is absent from the koebelei species-group. A key is provided to the world species of Agyrtodes, and the morphology of the genus is described and illustrated.
4153166|The beetle family Scarabaeidae has a high diversity of species, and some of these have become important pests. Endemic scarab pests are known from all habitable continents but represent no more than a small percentage (probably 1-2%) of the total number of species. Some species have become international pests through human transport to new habitats. Scarab pests cause damage through larval feeding on plant roots or adult feeding on the aerial parts of plants. The pests are difficult to control due to the cryptic position of the larvae in the soil and the usually nocturnal activity of the adults. Chemical control is now focussed on specific chemicals with less residual activity. Biological control, especially with pathogens, has proven highly effective against some species, but control agents are often specific to a single species. Attractants ranging from sex pheromones to food lures have been isolated for scarabaeid species. Integration of control methods (IPM) has provided effective control of some species but there is a need for continued research to refine control measures and develop new options for management of this important group of pests.
4153163| Scarabaeoidea is one of the biogeographically best known groups of organisms for Nuclear Central America, especially Guatemala. They have been used to determine areas of endemism for cloud forests of the region and to analyze relationships among these endemic areas. A major north-south division of these areas is described. Lowland scenarios are also given. This information was used for justifying the establishment of biological reserves in the area and is a tool available for prioritization of reserve establishment that could be adapted to other parts of the world as well. /// Scarabaeoidea es uno de los grupos mejor conocidos biogeograficamente en Centroamrica Nuclear, especialmente Guatemala.
