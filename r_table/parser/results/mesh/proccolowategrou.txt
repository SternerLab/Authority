4626699|Three years of research on great blue heron colonies in the southwest of mainland British Columbia has been varied in its course. Initial studies of 12 colonies showed that the birds were highly species specific within each as to trees used for nesting. Colonies in the study area are fewer in number that in the historic past, probably because urban and industrial sprawl have destroyed nesting habitat, but most remaining colonies are larger. There are probably about as many birds as in the past. Our study colonies are unexpectedly dynamic. Both from reports and our observations, it was found that they frequently changed location, joined others, split into smaller groups, and perhaps interchanged birds between colonies.
