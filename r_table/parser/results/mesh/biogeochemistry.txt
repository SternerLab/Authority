1469693| Yields and retention of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>+NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and nitrate concentrations in surface runoff are summarized for 28 high elevation watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California and Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado. Catchments ranged in elevation from 2475 to 3603 m and from 15 to 1908 ha in area. Soil cover varied from 5% to nearly 97% of total catchment area. Runoff from these snow-dominated catchments ranged from 315 to 1265 mm per year. In the Sierra Nevada, annual volume-weighted mean (AVWM) nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 13 M (overall average 5.4 M), and peak concentrations measured during snowmelt ranged from 1.0 to 38 M. Nitrate levels in the Rocky Mountain watersheds were about twice those in the Sierra Nevada; average AVWM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was 9.4 M and snowmelt peaks ranged from 15 to 50 M. Mean DIN loading to Rocky Mountain watersheds, 3.6 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, was double the average measured for Sierra Nevada watersheds, 1.8 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. DIN yield in the Sierra Nevada, 0.69 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, was about 60% that measured in the Rocky Mountains, 1.1 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Net inorganic N retention in Sierra Nevada catchments was 1.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and represented about 55% of annual DIN loading. DIN retention in the Rocky Mountain catchments was greater in absolute terms, 2.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and as a percentage of DIN loading, 72%. A correlation analysis using DIN yield, DIN retention and surface water nitrate concentrations as dependent variables and eight environmental features (catchment elevation, slope, aspect, roughness, area, runoff, soil cover and DIN loading) as independent variables was conducted. For the Sierra Nevada, elevation and soil cover had significant (p < 0.1) Pearson product moment correlations with catchment DIN yield, AVWM and peak snowmelt nitrate concentrations and DIN retention rates. Log-linear regression models using soil cover as the independent variable explained 82% of the variation in catchment DIN retention, 92% of the variability in AVWM nitrate and 85% of snowmelt peak NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. In the Rocky Mountains, soil cover was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with DIN yield, AVWM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and DIN retention expressed as a percentage of DIN loading (%DIN retention). Catchment mean slope and terrain roughness were positively correlated with steam nitrate concentrations and negatively related to %DIN retention. About 91% of the variation in DIN yield and 79% of the variability in AVWM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were explained by log-linear models based on soil cover. A log-linear regression based on soil cover explained 90% of the variation of % DIN retention in the Rocky Mountains. 
41490517|Ria Formosa is a Region of Restricted Exchange given its limited connection to coastal water circulation. Furthermore, it is subject to several anthropogenic activities that can lead to an increase in nutrients and potentially to eutrophication. Previous studies have shown the importance of the benthic compartment, specifically the microphytobenthos (MPB) in this shallow coastal lagoon. The dCSTTMPB model [new version of the dynamic Comprehensive Studies Task Team (dCSTT) model] here described couples the benthic and pelagic compartments. Due to the shallowness of the system, the benthic microalgae are one of the most important primary producers of the system. Preliminary results of the model show a large biomass of benthic microalgae, which strongly influences the pelagic chlorophyll concentration by resuspension. However, algae concentrations in the water column are relatively small due to the high flushing rate of the lagoon. The MPB community is mainly supported by nutrients in the pore water. A sensitivity analysis (SA) has revealed that the factors associated with the benthic compartment were the most important and sensitive to changes. Porosity, benthic chlorophyll recycling, loss of MPB due to grazing and the yield of microphytobenthic chlorophyll from nitrogen were some of the most sensitive parameters, as well as the ones associated with decay of particulate organic nitrogen. The development of our dCSTTMPB model has itself provided insights into benthic function.
20519799|Knowledge about the residence time of lead in the organic horizon (mor layer; O-horizon) overlaying forest mineral soils is important for the prediction of past and future lead levels in the boreal environment. To estimate the mean residence time (MRT) of lead in the mor layer, we use in this study from Northern Sweden three different approaches: (1) lead-210 is applied as a tracer of lead migration; (2) estimations of loss rates of stable lead (concentrations and Pb/Pb ratios) from the mor layer at an undisturbed forest setting, and (3) a study of lead in a soil series with sites of different age (a chronosequence of 20-220 years). In the last two approaches we compared measured inventories in the soil with estimated inventories derived using analyses of lake sediments. The results suggested a MRT of about 250 years in the mor layer in the mature forest and in the older parts of the chronosequence it was at least &gt;170 years. The agreement between the three different approaches gives good credibility to this estimate. It is also supported by a modeling of trends in the Pb/Pb ratio both between single cores and with depth in the mor layer. Our results suggest that it will take centuries for the deeper parts of the mor layer of undisturbed boreal forest soils to fully respond to decreased atmospheric lead pollution. However, data from the chronosequence indicate that the response could be much faster (MRT&lt; 50 years) in the mor layer at early stages of forest succession where graminoid and broadleaved litter fall dominates over conifer litter.

41490476|Rivers draining watersheds that include carbonate bedrock or organic matter (OM)-rich sedimentary rocks frequently have C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) relative to rivers draining carbonate-and OM-free watersheds, due to dissolution of carbonate and/or decomposition of ancient OM. However, our results from a subtropical river, the Brazos River in Texas, USA, show that in this watershed human activities appear to dominate basin lithology in controlling the origin and metabolism of DIC. The middle Brazos flows through limestone and coal-bearing bedrock, but DIC isotope data suggest no limestone dissolution or respiration of ancient OM, and instead reflect efficient air-water CO exchange, degradation of relatively young OM and photosynthesis in the river as a result of river damming and urban treated wastewater input. The lower Brazos drains only small areas of carbonate and coal-bearing bedrock, but DIC isotope data suggest the strong influence of carbonate dissolution, with a potentially minor contribution from decomposition of old soil organic matter (SOM). Oyster shells and crushed carbonate minerals used in road construction are likely sources of carbonate in the lower Brazos, in addition to natural marl and pedogenic carbonate. Additionally, the generally low pCO and high DIC concentration in the Brazos River lead to a low CO outgassing: DIC export ratio, distinguishing the Brazos River from other rivers.
1469561|Certain general circulation models predict that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will increase the frequency of summer drought in northern wetlands due to hotter, drier summers. There is currently much uncertainty as to how drought will affect emissions of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, from wetlands. We have demonstrated that an eight centimetre drawdown of the water table in a gully mire does not significantly affect nitrous oxide emissions from this site. However, under a more extreme drought scenario carried out on peat monoliths, nitrous oxide emissions increased exponentially with a linear decrease in water table height. Drought caused a significant increase in nitrous oxide production below the water table but most of the total increase could be attributed to increased emissions above the water table. Results from an acetylene block experiment suggested that increased emissions were caused by increased nitrous oxide production from denitrification, rather than by increased production from nitrification. In the laboratory study, drought severity had no effect on peatwater nitrate concentrations below the water table, however, increasing drought severity decreased ammonium concentrations.
40980875|Belowground respiration is typically the largest flux of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere, making up > 70% of total respiration in boreal forests. Recent work has shown that belowground respiration continues during the snowcovered season in boreal ecosystems, but few studies have made complementary measurements during the snow-free season and it remains uncertain what proportion of annual belowground respiration occurs during winter. Traditional models of the relationship between temperature and respiration assume fixed temperature sensitivity, but it has become clear that the apparent temperature sensitivity of belowground respiration increases as soils approach 0C. Use of fixed temperature sensitivity to model carbon budgets of northern ecosystems may, therefore, yield misleading results. We measured belowground respiration monthly over 2 years in four ecosystems along an elevation gradient in south-central Alaska. Three models, representing different hypotheses about the relationship between temperature and respiration, were confronted with the data. A logistic model, which allows the temperature sensitivity to vary inversely with temperature, and a variation of the Q model, which allows the temperature sensitivity to vary seasonally, performed well at all sites and produced similar estimates of seasonal and annual belowground respiration. The traditional Q model performed poorly at all sites and overestimated respiration during the snow-covered season. Annual belowground respiration was generally greater than in ecosystems of interior Alaska, where winters are colder and summers are warmer and drier. Belowground respiration during the snow-covered season made up 6-15% of the annual total a small, but sensitive, component of annual carbon budgets.
40343750|Topographic factors affect nitrogen cycling in forest soils, including nitrous oxide (NO) emissions, which contribute to the greenhouse effect. We measured the NO flux at 14 chambers placed along a 65-m transect on a slope for 1 year at 2-to 3-week intervals. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian model with a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model to assess the spatiotemporal NO flux along a slope and quantify the effects of environmental factors on NO emissions. NO fluxes at chambers located at lower positions along the slope were relatively greater than those at higher positions. During the non-soilfreezing period, NO fluxes fluctuated seasonally depending on soil temperature. The soil temperature dependency of NO fluxes at each chamber increased with descending slope position (the median of the Q equivalent simulated from posterior distribution ranged from 1.18 to 3.64). According to the Bayesian hierarchical model, this trend could be partially explained by the C/N ratio at each chamber position. During the soil-freezing period, relatively high NO fluxes were observed at lower positions along the slope.
1469677|Soils contain various iron compounds that differ in solubility, reducibility and extractability. Moreover, the contribution of the various iron compounds to total iron (Fe) and total Fe concentrations differs highly among soils. As a result, the total reducible Fe content can also differ among soils, and so does the dynamics of iron reduction. These factors complicate the prediction of reducible Fe based on Fe extraction data and hamper the application of process-based models for reduced or waterlogged soils where redox processes play a key-role. This paper presents a theoretical analysis relating reducible to extractable Fe reported in the literature. Predictions made from this theoretical analysis were evaluated in soil incubations using 18 rice paddy soils from all over the world. The incubation studies and the literature study both show that reducible Fe can be related to Fe from some selected, but not all, iron extractions. The combination of measurements for labile Fe(III)oxides (derived from oxalate-extractable Fe) and stabile Fe(III)oxides (derived from dithionite-citrate-extractable Fe) shows highly significant correlations with reducible Fe with high coefficients of determination (r<sup>2</sup>=0.92-0.95 depending on the definition of stabile Fe(III)oxides). Given the high diversity in rice soils used for the incubations, these regression equations will have general applicability. Application of these regression equations in combination with soil database information may improve the predictive ability of process-based models where soil redox processes are important, such as CH<sub>4</sub> emission models derived for rice paddies or wetlands.
1468786|Path analysis was used to determine the importance of long-term disturbance regime and the relative importances of correlations among vegetation patterns, disturbance history, and nitrogen (N) mineralization in old-growth forests of northwestern Minnesota. Leaf biomass (estimated by allometric equations), fire history (from fire scars on Pinus resinosa trees), and N mineralization rates (estimated from incubations in situ) were determined from sample plots dominated by - Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides, and P. grandidentata, - a mixture of Acer saccharum and Tilia americana, or - Quercus borealis and Ostrya virginiana. Results showed that topographic and soil-moisture controls on N mineralization, vegetation patterns, and disturbance are substantially stronger than is suggested by direct correlation. Indirect interactions among ecosystem variables played in important role. These interactions probably include the tendency for species that cycle large amounts of N to colonize more mesic sites that burned rarely in the past. Soil moisture was correlated both directly with N mineralization and indirectly, through its effects on vegetation pattern, and thus, litter quality. Although disturbance regime also depended on topography, the strengths of relationships between disturbance regime and other variables were relatively weak. These dependencies suggested that long-term fire regime is probably more a consequence than a cause for vegetation and fertility patterns. Topography, through its effects on soil moisture and microclimate, is an overriding influence on ecosystem properties, which in turn influence fire regime.
1469578|Soil phosphorus (P) dynamics are controlled by the interaction of geochemical, biochemical and biological processes. Changes in species composition or management could alter the relative importance of these processes. We examined soil P dynamics in two plantations of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing red alder (Alnus rubra) by determining the fate and effects of added fertilizer P. History of the plantations varied such that sites were previously occupied by 60-yr-old stands of alder or non-fixing Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Without fertilization, the soil with a longer period of alder influence had more organic P (P<sub>o</sub>) and less sorbed inorganic P (Hydroxide- and Bicarb-extractable P<sub>i</sub>). Fertilization increased soil total P, and 88% of the fertilizer was accounted for in the surface mineral soil (0-15 cm). Sorbed P<sub>i</sub> was the major sink for fertilizer P (55-60%), independent of site history. Although P<sub>o</sub> was 35-70% of soil P in unfertilized plots, added P did not accumulate as P<sub>o</sub>. Neither site history nor P addition influenced phosphatase activity. Fertilization increased decomposition during incubation of the organic horizon, suggesting that late-stage decomposition is P-limited in these N-rich soils. On the time-scale of a few years, geochemical sorption and desorption of inorganic P were the most important processes controlling the distribution of added P. Organic P accumulation is expected to occur over a longer time frame, linked to the production and turnover of organic matter.
41490545|Wildfire in California annual grasslands is an important ecological disturbance and ecosystem control. Regional and global climate changes that affect aboveground biomass will alter fire-related nutrient loading and promote increased frequency and severity of fire in these systems. This can have longterm impacts on soil microbial dynamics and nutrient cycling, particularly in N-limited systems such as annual grasslands. We examined the effects of a lowseverity fire on microbial biomass and specific microbial lipid biomarkers over 3 years following a fire at the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment. We also examined the impact of fire on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), specifically Nitrosospira Cluster 3a ammonia-oxidizers, and nitrification rates 9 months post-fire. Finally, we examined the interactive effects of fire and three other global change factors (N-deposition, precipitation and CO) on plant biomass and soil microbial communities for three growing seasons after fire. Our results indicate that a low-severity fire is associated with earlier season primary productivity and higher soil-NH concentrations in the first growing season following fire. Belowground productivity and total microbial biomass were not influenced by fire. Diagnostic microbial lipid biomarkers, including those for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, were reduced by fire 9-and 21-months post-fire, respectively. All effects of fire were indiscernible by 33-months post-fire, suggesting that above and belowground responses to fire do not persist in the long-term and that these grassland communities are resilient to fire disturbance. While N-deposition increased soil NH, and thus available NH, AOB abundance, nitrification rates and Cluster 3a AOB, similar increases in NH in the fire plots did not affect AOB or nitrification. We hypothesize that this difference in response to N-addition involves a mediation of P-limitation as a result of fire, possibly enhanced by increased plant competition and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-plant associations after fire.
4151499|The decomposition of belowground and aboveground tree litter was studied on five forest sites across Switzerland, ranging from 480 to 1500 m in altitude, and including calcareous and acidic soils. In addition to decomposition of local litter types (Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica, Castanea sativa), the decomposition of a standard beech litter was studied on all sites. After 2 years of decomposition, mass loss ranged from 18 to 71% across the different sites and litter types. The lowest decomposition rates were observed for beech roots, while mass loss was greatest for both spruce needles and spruce roots at the low-altitude site. Mass loss during the first winter correlated best with the content of watersoluble substances. After 1 year of incubation, mass loss of the standard litter varied less than did mass loss of local litter, but variance increased during the second year for aboveground litter. These observations indicate a smaller climatic influence on litter breakdown at the beginning of the decomposition process. Litter mass loss could be described using an exponential model with a decay constant depending on either lignin/N ratio or Mn content of the litter and annual soil temperature and throughfall precipitation as climatic variables. Modelling the observed mass loss indicated a strong influence of litter quality in the first 2 years of decomposition, confirming the field data from the standard litter experiment. The experiment will continue for some years and is expected to yield additional data on long-term decomposition.
40800609|We synthesized available data for decomposition of pine (Pinus) needle litter in pine forests to determine the litter chemical characteristics and climate factors that explained variation in the limit value, i.e. the level of accumulated mass loss at which the decomposition process either continues at a very low rate or possibly stops. Our data base included 56 separate studies on decomposition of pine needle litter, spanning Scots pine, lodgepole pine, Aleppo pine, stone pine and white pine, mainly incubated at the site of collection. Studies had 5 to 19 samplings, on average 10, and the decomposition was followed to a mass loss ranging from 47 to 83%, on average 67%. The periods from 3.0 to 5.4 years, on average 3.9 years, were of sufficient duration to allow estimates of limit values of decomposition. We used a linear mixed model with regression effects to relate limit values to potential explanatory variables, namely the sites' long-term mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) and to substrate-chemistry factors. Regarding the latter, we explored two models; one that included initial concentrations of water solubles, lignin, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Mn and one that included only lignin, N, Ca, and Mn to focus on those nutrients known to influence lignin degradation. Using backward elimination significant explanatory variables were determined. For litter decomposed in its site of origin we found the limit value to depend mainly on the initial concentration of Mn, with higher Mn concentrations resulting in higher accumulated mass loss. Thus, litter with higher Mn reached a higher limit value and left a smaller stable fraction. This is likely due to the fact that Mn is an essential component of ligninolytic enzymes important for degrading litter in the later stages of decomposition. Manganese has received little attention in decomposition studies to date. Given its significance in this synthesis, the role of Mn in influencing variation in the late stages of decomposition among ecosystems and among litters of other genera besides Pinus deserves further attention.
41490480|The effect of water table fluctuations on the interaction between nitrogen mineralization in buried organic-rich soil horizons and nitrate mobilization into groundwater was examined in the riparian zone of a small headwater agricultural catchment in southern Ontario, Canada. Riparian soils contained buried organic layers and lenses overlying a poorly sorted gravel layer at a depth of 0.8-1.0 m. The riparian water table in summer 2006 generally remained within 0.4 m of the surface, whereas during a major drought in 2007 the water table declined to > 1.9 m in August and riparian soils above the gravel layer inland from the stream remained unsaturated from mid-June to early November. Mean daily net N mineralization and nitrification rates during 2-4 week in situ soil incubations were 0.2-1.35 mg N kg- day- in 0-10 cm surface soils in May-September 2006, whereas N mineralization and nitrification were negligible at 30 45 and 60-75 cm soil depths. In summer and fall 2007, high daily rates of N mineralization and nitrification of 0.3-0.8 mg N kg- day occurred at 30-45 and 60-75 cm depths that were similar to surface soil rates. The soil nitrate pool at 60-75 cm depth was 16X larger in autumn 2007 in comparison to 2006. During high water tables in November 2006 groundwater in the gravel layer had low N  N concentrations of < 0.1 mg 1 1 . In contrast, after the drought in 2007 nitrate was flushed into groundwater as the water table rose to within 30-50 cm of the surface in December. An extensive area of high NON concentrations (3-18 mg 1 1 ) occurred inland from the stream bank. This zone of high nitrates declined gradually by April 2008 probably as a result of denitrification. These results indicate that buried organic deposits at depth within riparian areas can be important nitrogen sources during major water table drawdowns. The influence of these episodes of mineralization at depth during droughts on riparian groundwater chemistry and the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere merit further research.
40980893|Climate change is projected to increase mean temperature of northern lakes by the end of the twenty-first century. To simulate this scenario, during 2004-2007 we imposed artificial mixing in Halsjrvi, a small, polyhumic, boreal lake in southern Finland, to increase the depth of the thermocline by ~ 1.5 m. The aims of the experiment were to evaluate potential effects of climate change on biogeochemical cycles, especially of mercury, and on food web structure, productivity and biodiversity in dystrophic lake ecosystems. Following the initial depression of the thermocline in the experimental lake, the methyl mercury (MeHg) concentration in small European perch (Perca fluviatlis L.) decreased and remained lower throughout the study. In contrast, perch in a nearby reference lake exhibited increased MeHg during the same period. The N values of the muscle tissue of perch were similar in both lakes over the study period, suggesting that the trophic position of perch remained unchanged. However, C values of perch became clearly more negative in Halsjrvi, probably due to the greater mixing of the water column that resulted in changes in the carbon sources for the food web. A marked decrease of epilimnetic MeHg concentrations recorded during the experiment was considered to be the main reason for the decreased MeHg concentrations in perch. The results suggest that oxygen-related changes induced by climate change will be more important than direct temperature changes for MeHg accumulation in fish in small humic lakes with persistent oxygen deficiency in the hypolimnion.
41410607|Although sediments of the German Wadden Sea are suspected to eliminate a considerable share of nitrate delivered to the SE North Sea, their denitrification rates have not been systematically assessed. We determined N production rates over seasonal cycles (February 2009-April 2010) at two locations with two sediments types each, the first site (Meldorf Bight) receiving nitrate during all seasons from the Elbe river plume, and a second site on the island of Sylt, where nitrate is depleted during summer months. In sediments from the Sylt site, N production ranged from 15 to 32 mol N m h in the fine sand station and from 7 to 13 mol N m h in the coarse sand station; N production was not detected when nitrate was depleted in May and July of 2009. N production in the Meldorf Bight sediments were consistently detected at higher rates (58-130 mol N m h in the very fine sand station and between 14 and 30 mol N m h in the medium sand station). Analysis of ancillary parameters suggests that major factors controlling N production in coastal sediments of the German Wadden Sea are the nitrate concentrations in the overlying water, the ambient temperature, and the organic matter content of the sediment. Extrapolating our spot measurements to the zone of nitrate availability and sediment types, we estimate an annual nitrogen removal rate around 16 kt N year for the entire northern sector of the German Wadden Sea area. This corresponds to 14% of the annual Elbe river nitrogen load.
23359740|Many terrestrial soils in the US Midwest are temporally flooded during the spring. The effects of short-term flooding on biogeochemical processes that occur in these soils are not fully understood and are the subject of this study. To evaluate these processes we investigated the redox-induced changes in the soil solution for three-cultivated and three-uncultivated/forest soils with different organic matter concentrations. The soils were flooded for 1, 3, 7, and 14-days under anoxic conditions in a biogeochemical reactor. Samples were analyzed for Eh; pH; NO 3 - ; NH 4 + ; total dissolved Mn and Fe; soluble P; dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOCDIC); and evolved CO 2 . We found strongly contrasting responses of the terrestrial soils to flooding. Reducing conditions were established quickly in the uncultivated and more slowly in the cultivated soils. Concomitant changes in pH were higher for the uncultivated soils. The uncultivated soils showed a higher increase in the amount of NH 4 + , P, Fe, Mn than the cultivated soils over the 14-day incubation. The total amount of carbon decomposed was much greater for the uncultivated soils with approximately 900 g C (CO 2 + DOC + DIC) decomposed per gram of soil compared to a total decomposition of 240 g C ${\mathrm{g}}_{\mathrm{s}\mathrm{o}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{l}}^{-1}$ for the cultivated soils indicating differences in the type of carbon decomposed. The rapid onset of reducing conditions for the uncultivated soils is attributed to a reactive carbon component that is either absent or occluded in the cultivated soils. This study demonstrates that the biogeochemically-induced changes in carbon dynamics in terrestrial soils are strongly influenced by short-term flooding and the history of soil management.
1469533|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and export were studied in two small catchments in central Ontario to examine DOC sources and to assess the hypothesis that organic matter adjacent to the stream is a significant contributor of DOC during storms. Different DOC dynamics and exports were observed according to the depth of the riparian water table. In Harp 4-21, riparian flowpaths were predominantly through A and upper B soil horizons and riparian soils contributed between 73 and 84% of the stream DOC export during an autumn storm. In Harp 3A, riparian flowpaths were predominantly through lower B horizons. Consequently, riparian soils were less important and hillslopes contributed more than 50% of the stream DOC export in subcatchments without wetlands during storms. Wetlands and adjacent soils contributed significantly to DOC export in Harp 3A; 8% of the total catchment area exported 32 to 46% of the storm runoff DOC. DOC export dynamics in wetlands and riparian soils were distinctly different. In wetlands, transport was affected by leaching and flushing of DOC at the wetland surface leading to lower DOC concentrations with successive storms. In riparian soils, groundwater flowpaths were more important and stronger positive relationships between discharge and DOC concentration were observed. Precipitation, throughfall and stemflow were minor sources of stream DOC during storms and contributed less than 20% of the total export.
20519792|Since 1987 we have studied weekly change in winter (December-April) precipitation, snowpack, snowmelt, soil water, and stream water solute flux in a small (176-ha) Northern Michigan watershed vegetated by 65-85 year-old northern hardwoods. Our primary study objective was to quantify the effect of change in winter temperature and precipitation on watershed hydrology and solute flux. During the study winter runoff was correlated with precipitation, and forest soils beneath the snowpack remained unfrozen. Winter air temperature and soil temperature beneath the snowpack increased while precipitation and snowmelt declined. Atmospheric inputs declined for H,

The
1469040|The seasonal variation in sulfate reduction and the dynamics of sulfur and iron geochemistry were studied throughout a year in sediment of Aarhus Bay, Denmark. A radiotracer method for measuring sulfate reduction rates was applied with incubation times down to 15 min and a depth resolution down to 2 mm in the oxidized surface layer of the sediment. The radiotracer data were analyzed by a mathematical model which showed that, due to partial, rapid reoxidation of radioactive sulfide during incubation, the actual reduction rates in this layer were probably underestimated 5-fold. In the deeper, sulfidic zone, measured rates appeared to be correct. Sulfate reduction followed the seasonal variation in temperature with maximum activity at 1-2 cm depth in late summer. In spite of its rapid production, free H<sub>2</sub>S was detectable in the porewater only below the depth of free Fe<sup>2+</sup> at 6-7 cm throughout the year. Following the massive sedimentation from a spring phytoplankton bloom, anaerobic degradation of phytoplankton detritus was strongly stimulated over several weeks. A transient reversed redox zonation developed with a thin, black zone on top of the brown, oxidized sediment layer due to intensive sulfate and iron reduction. Mineralization through sulfate reduction was equivalent to two thirds of the annual net sedimentation of organic matter.
20456485|Knowledge of the complex life cycle of Phaeocystis is a key to understanding its role in marine ecosystems and global biogeochemistry. An existing life cycle model was modified and used to integrate understanding of the Phaeocystis life cycle. In model-driven research, models expose gaps in our understanding, empirical studies ensue, and feedback improves understanding. Following this scheme, three facets of the life cycle model were examined here. With four exceptions, the empirical studies described have been presented in other literature citations. The first facet involved testing for the existence of a process or producing its description. These studies included: demonstration of in vitro colony division in Phaeocystis pouchetii, description of in vitro change in colony shape for P. pouchetii associated with senescence, determining which P. pouchetii life stage is vulnerable to viral infection and lysis, and an experiment designed to determine whether the sediment could be a source of new Phaeocystis colonies to overlying waters; results suggested that more-detailed investigation of benthic particles as a physical substrate for colony formation is warranted. The second facet involved investigation of process rate quantification or process control parameters. Process rate quantification included measurements of colony division rate and growth rate using mesocosm-derived colonies. Process control experiments included testing diatom frustule enhancement of P. pouchetii colony formation from solitary cells, and investigation of mesozooplanktonic suppression and microzooplanktonic enhancement of Phaeocystis globosa colony formation by planktonic grazer infochemicals. The third facet pertained to the molecular identification of genetic differences between single cells and colonies of P. globosa. These studies were designed to provide insight to the question of control factors involved in the transition between single cell and colonial life stages. The life cycle model provided a ready place to incorporate new insights and understanding from empirical studies into an existing model, and can be used to improve simulation models of the direct and indirect effects of Phaeocystis on global biogeochemistry.
20456400|We explore the dynamics of soil organic carbon of various forms and its relation with soil fertility in seeded alfalfa grassland established using a field micro-catchment technique to harvest water on the semiarid Loess Plateau in China. Five regimes were set up: (1) conventional flat cultivation without mulch (CK), (2) ridges and furrows were set up alternately on flat land, with 15 cm between each so that the distance between successive ridges (or successive furrows) was 30 cm, and the ridges were mulched with plastic film (M30), (3) similar to M30, but with twice the distance between furrows and ridges (M60), (4) similar to M30, but the ridges were not mulched (B30), (5) similar to M60, but the ridges were not mulched (B60). The increase in alfalfa forage yield in the mulch regimes promotes soil organic carbon (SOC) content, the light fraction of organic carbon (LFOC), the heavy fraction of organic carbon (HFOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). MBC was significantly higher in M30 and M60 than in the other regimes. Significant positive correlation is found between MBC and LFOC (R=0.89; P&lt;0.0001), and MBC and HFOC (R=0.82; P=0.00016). At the end of our three-year experiment, the C/N ratio of 10.09 in M60 was significantly (P&lt;0.005) higher than the other regimes. Since a lower C/N ratio accelerates SOC decomposition in this region, the higher C/N ratio in M60 could limit mineralization of soil nitrogen, conserving soil nitrogen and SOC. The lower ratio of nitrate and nitrite nitrogen to total nitrogen, of 10.74, in M60 at the end of this experiment than in the other regimes and before sowing supports this point. The correlations of SOC with available P and with the ratio of available P to total P are positive in the dry year of 2001, but negative in the wet year of 2002. This can be explained on the basis that a high forage yield of alfalfa requires more soil available P in the wet years than in the dry years.
1469216| The purpose of this study was to relate regional variation in litter mass-loss rates (first year) in pine forests to climate across a large, continental-scale area. The variation in mass-loss rate was analyzed using 39 experimental sites spanning climatic regions from the subarctic to subtropical and Mediterranean: the latitudinal gradient ranged from 31 N to 70 N and may represent the the largest geographical area that has ever been sampled and observed for the purpose of studying biogeochemical processes. Because of unified site design and uniform laboratory procedures, data from all sites were directly comparable and permitted a determination of the relative influence of climate versus substrate quality viewed from the perspective of broad regional scales. Simple correlation applied to the entire data set indicated that annual actual evapotranspiration (AET) should be the leading climatic constraint on mass-loss rates (R<sub>adj</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.496). The combination of AET, average July temp. and average annual temp. could explain about 70% of the sites' variability on litter mass-loss. In an analysis of 23 Scots pine sites north of the Alps and Carpatians AET alone could account for about 65% of the variation and the addition of a substrate-quality variable was sufficiently significant to be used in a model. The influence of litter quality was introduced into a model, using data from 11 sites at which litter of different quality had been incubated. These sites are found in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. At any one site most (> 90%) of the variation in mass-loss rates could be explained by one of the litter-quality variables giving concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus or water solubles. However, even when these models included nitrogen or phosphorus even small changes in potential evapotranspiration resulted in large changes in early-phase decay rates. Further regional subdivision of the data set, resulted in a range of strength in the relationship between loss rate and climatic variables, from very weak in Central Europe to strong for the Scandinavian and Atlantic coast sites (R<sub>adj</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.912; AET versus litter mass loss). Much of the variation in observed loss rates could be related to continental versus marine/Atlantic influences. Inland locations had mass-loss rates lower than should be expected on the basis of for example AET alone. Attempts to include seasonality variables were not successful. It is clear that either unknown errors and biases, or, unknown variables are causing these regional differences in response to climatic variables. Nevertheless these results show the powerful influence of climate as a control of the broad-scale geography of mass-loss rates and substrate quality at the stand level. Some of these relationships between mass-loss rate and climatic variables are among the highest ever reported, probably because of the care taken to select uniform sites and experimental methods. This suggest that superior, base line maps of predicted mass-loss rates could be produced using climatic data. These models should be useful to predict the changing equilibrium litter dynamics resulting from climatic change. 
1469769|Understanding of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes to the atmosphere is complicated by interactions between chemical and physical controls on both production and movement of the gas. To better understand how N<sub>2</sub>O production is controlled in the soil, we measured concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O and of the proximal controllers on its production in soil water and soil air in a field study in the Rio Icacos basin of the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. A toposequence (ridge, slope-ridge break, slope, slope-riparian break, riparian, and streambank) was used that has been previously characterized for groundwater chemistry and surface N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. The proximal controls on N<sub>2</sub>O production include NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, DOC, and O<sub>2</sub>. Nitrous oxide and O<sub>2</sub> were measured in soil air and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and DO were measured in soil water. Nitrate and DOC disappeared from soil solution at the slope-riparian interface, where soil N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations increased dramatically. Soil N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations continued to increase through the flood plain and the streambank. Nitrous oxide concentrations were highest in soil air probes that had intermediate O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Changes in N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations in groundwater and soil air in different environments along the catena appear to be controlled by O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In general, N processing in the unsaturated and saturated zones differs within each topographic position apparently due to differences in redox status.
1468914|We measured the concentrations of reduced sulfur compounds in the atmospheric boundary layer over an equatorial African rain forest. Results obtained from a dirigible hot air balloon and a tethered balloon system in the early morning hours reflect a multilayered structure of the atmospheric boundary layer with gradients of COS and CS<sub>2</sub> indicating an uptake/production of these trace gases by the soil/vegetation system. In addition, we studied emission and deposition fluxes of volatile reduced sulfur compounds from tropical tree species using cuvettes to directly measure the exchange behavior of tree twigs. These cuvettes were operated at young trees in a forest clearing near ground level as well as at a mature tree species on top of the forest canopy, employing a specially designed tree top jungle raft ('Treetop Raft III, Dirigible version') placed on the canopy crown. The results show qualitative and quantitative disparities between different tree species as well as between individuals of the same species near ground level (young) and at the top of the canopy (mature). We found some correlations between photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and emission of sulfur compounds. Comparison between measurements at the ground and at the canopy top show that the studied tree species adapts its photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in response to the climatic conditions at the canopy top. This is accompanied by a quantitative change in trace gas emission. Lower CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rates are accompanied by an increase in the emission of reduced sulfur compounds. We propose the increase of DMS emission at the canopy top to be explained by a potential demand of nitrogen in the foliage resulting in an accumulation of sulfur.
20456544|Well-constrained carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios in planktonic biomass, and their importance in advancing our understanding of biological processes and nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems, has motivated ecologists to search for similar patterns in terrestrial ecosystems. Recent analyses indicate the existence of "Redfield-like" ratios in plants, and such data may provide insight into the nature of nutrient limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. We searched for analogous patterns in the soil and the soil microbial biomass by conducting a review of the literature. Although soil is characterized by high biological diversity, structural complexity and spatial heterogeneity, we found remarkably consistent C:N:P ratios in both total soil pools and the soil microbial biomass. Our analysis indicates that, similar to marine phytoplankton, element concentrations of individual phylogenetic groups within the soil microbial community may vary, but on average, atomic C:N:P ratios in both the soil (186:13:1) and the soil microbial biomass (60:7:1) are well-constrained at the global scale. We did see significant variation in soil and microbial element ratios between vegetation types (i.e., forest versus grassland), but in most cases, the similarities in soil and microbial element ratios among sites and across large scales were more apparent than the differences. Consistent microbial biomass element ratios, combined with data linking specific patterns of microbial element stoichiometry with direct evidence of microbial nutrient limitation, suggest that measuring the proportions of C, N and P in the microbial biomass may represent another useful tool for assessing nutrient limitation of ecosystem processes in terrestrial ecosystems.
1469645|We investigated the relationship between plant nitrogen limitation and water availability in dryland ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that at lower levels of annual precipitation, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is limited primarily by water whereas at higher levels of precipitation, it is limited primarily by nitrogen. Using a literature survey of fertilization experiments in arid, semi-arid, and subhumid ecosystems, we investigated the response of ANPP to nitrogen addition as a function of variation in precipitation across geographic gradients, as well as across year-to-year variation in precipitation within sites. We used four different indices to assess the degree of N limitation: (1) Absolute Increase of plant production in response to fertilization (the slope of ANPP vs. amount of added N at different levels of annual precipitation); (2) Relative Response (the percent increase in fertilized over control ANPP at different levels of N addition); (3) Fertilizer Use Efficiency (FUE, the absolute gain in productivity per amount of fertilizer N), and (4) Maximum Response (the greatest absolute increase in ANPP at saturating levels of N addition). Relative Response to fertilization did not significantly increase with increasing precipitation either across the geographic gradient or across year-to-year variation within sites. Nor did the Maximum Response to fertilization increase with increasing precipitation across the geographic gradient. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the Absolute Increase and FUE indices with both geographical and temporal variation in precipitation. Together, these results indicate that there is not necessarily a shift of primary limitation from water to N across the geographic water availability gradient. Instead, our results support the hypothesis of co-limitation. The apparently contradictory results from the four indices of N limitation can best be explained by an integration of plant ecophysiological, community, and ecosystem mechanisms whereby plants are co-limited by multiple resources, species shifts occur in response to changing resource levels, and nitrogen and water availability are tightly linked through biogeochemical feedbacks.
20519787|Flocculent materials (floc), in aquatic systems usually consist of a non-consolidated layer of biogenic, detrital material relatively rich in organic matter which represents an important food-web component for invertebrates and fish. Thus, variations in its composition could impact food webs and change faunal structure. Transport, remineralization rates and deposition of floc may also be important factors in soil/sediment formation. In spite of its relevance and sensitivity to external factors, few chemical studies have been carried out on the biogeochemistry of floc material. In this study, we focused on the molecular characterization of the flocculent organic matter (OM), the assessment of its origin and its environmental fate at five stations along a freshwater to marine ecotone, namely the Taylor Slough, Everglades National Park (ENP), Florida. To tackle this issue, suspended, unconsolidated, detrital floc samples, soils/sediments and plants were analyzed for bulk properties, biomarkers and pigments. Both geochemical proxies and biomass-specific biomarkers were used to assess OM sources and transformations. Our results show that the detrital organic matter of the flocculent material is largely regulated by local vegetation inputs, ranging from periphyton, emergent and submerged plants and terrestrial plants such as mangroves, with molecular evidence of different degrees of diagenetic reworking, including fungal activity. Evidence is presented for both hydrodynamic transport of floc materials, and incorporation of floc OM into soils/sediments. However, some molecular parameters showed a decoupling between floc and underlying soil/sediment OM, suggesting that physical transport, incorporation and degradation/remineralization of OM in floc may be controlled by a combination of a variety of complex biogeochemical variables including hydrodynamic transport, hydroperiod characteristics, primary productivity, nutrient availability, and OM quality among others. Further investigations are needed to better understand the ecological role of floc in freshwater and coastal wetlands.
1468859| Most of the small external inputs of N to the Shortgrass steppe appear to be conserved. One pathway of loss is the emission of nitrous oxide, which we estimate to account for 2.5-9.0% of annual wet deposition inputs of N. These estimates were determined from an N<sub>2</sub>O emission model based on field data which describe the temporal variability of N<sub>2</sub>O produced from nitrification and denitrification from two slope positions. Soil water and temperature models were used to translate records of air temperature and precipitation between 1950 and 1984 into variables appropriate to drive the gas flux model, and annual N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were estimated for that period. The mean annual fluxes were 80 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> for a midslope location and 160 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> for a swale. Fluxes were higher in wet years than in dry, ranging from 73 to 100 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> at the midslope, but the variability was not high. N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were also estimated from cattle urine patches and these fluxes while high within a urine patch, did not contribute significantly to a regional budget. Laboratory experiments using C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> to inhibit nitrifiers suggested that 60-80% of N<sub>2</sub>O was produced as a result of nitrification, with denitrification being less important, in contrast to our earlier findings to the contrary. Intrasite and intraseasonal variations in N<sub>2</sub>O flux were coupled to variations in mineral N dynamics, with high rates of N<sub>2</sub>O flux occurring with high rates of inorganic N turnover. We computed a mean flux of 104 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> from the shortgrass landscape, and a flux of 2.6  109 g N y<sup>-1</sup> from all shortgrass steppe (25  106 ha). 
1469387|Lake Kinneret (Israel) has undergone several prominent chemical and biological changes since 1970. Between 1970 and 1991 significant, long-term gradual increase were recorded in epilimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (about 20%), and in pH levels (0.2 units). Concomitantly there was a significant increase in hypolimnetic H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations (about 75%) and a long-term gradual drop in zooplankton biomass (50%). Since 1994 these trends were reversed and the levels of the three chemical parameters have returned to those found in the 1970's and that of zooplankton to mid 1980's levels. The present study is an attempt to relate some of these long term changes by means of yearly oxygen budgets, based on fluxes of oxygen producing and consuming processes. This analysis raises the possibility that part of the long-term increase in epilimnetic DO and pH between 1970 to 1990 may be attributed to reduced inputs of organic matter from alochthonous sources and possibly to enhanced burial of organic matter in the bed sediments. However, the major cause for the observed increase in epilimnetic DO and pH is increased sedimentation of organic matter to the hypolimnion during stratification. As indicated by the amount of H<sub>2</sub>S formed in the hypolimnion during stratification added to the amount of oxygen entrapped in this layer at the onset of thermal stratification, between 1970 to 1991 the sedimentation flux of organic matter increased by approximately 40%. It is estimated that during these two decades hypolimnetic respiration increased from ca. 8% of the annual amount of oxygen evolved due to photosynthesis during the early 1970's to ca. 12.5% during the 1980's. The shift in the layer of oxidative processes is suggested to be the result of a multi-annual decline in zooplankton grazing pressure, which led to increased sedimentation of organic matter. The reversed trends for DO, pH and H<sub>2</sub>S since 1994 may have partially been due to the increase in zooplankton activity and partially due to changes in phytoplankton community structure.
1469946|In the present study we characterized the buffering system including aluminum in the organic surface horizon (O) of field experiments with replicated plots of pure Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and replicated plots of spruce with a birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.) admixture. Our results show that a change in tree species composition may have a rather large, short-term (12 years) effect on the concentration of organically bound aluminum in the humus layer (H) of the O horizon. The pure spruce plots had a significantly higher concentration of exchangeable aluminum (Al<sub>e</sub>) and organically bound (pyrophosphate extractable) aluminum (Al<sub>p</sub>) in the H layer and a lower concentration of each base cation. Furthermore, our results confirm earlier findings that aluminum has base cation properties in acidic organic horizons. Thus, the change in tree species composition did not affect the pH in spite of a change in base saturation, because base cations were mainly compensated for by aluminum. The change in organically bound aluminum was accompanied by a similar change in organically bound pyrophosphate extractable iron (Fe<sub>p</sub>). The observed differences between the mixed and pure spruce plots in the amounts of Al<sub>p</sub> and Fe<sub>p</sub> in the H layer could not be explained by estimated differences in biocycling of Al and Fe either by above-ground litterfall or by root turnover.
1468711|Increased emissions of nitrogen compounds to the atmosphere by human activities have been well documented. However, in order to better quantify these anthropogenic emissions, better knowledge of natural emissions rates must be known. In addition, variation in natural emissions through time should be documented. In this note we present data collected and/or analyzed by us for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in recent snow from remote regions of the world. We also summarize existing data sets from other remote regions. This is done to establish a better understanding of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition rates in these regions as well as to add more information to our global understanding of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition.
1469542| Methane emissions were measured over a 17-month interval at 21 locations on the Orinoco fringing floodplain and upper delta (total area, 14,000 km<sup>2</sup>). Emissions totaled 0.17 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup>, or 7.1 mmol d<sup>-1</sup> (114 mg d<sup>-1</sup>; standard deviation, 18%) per m<sup>2</sup> of water surface. Ebullition accounted for 65% of emissions. Emission rates were about five times as high for floodplain forest as for open water or macrophyte mats. Emission rates were positively correlated with carbon content of sediment and amount of methane in the water column, and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen, but the correlations were weak. Emission from floodplain soils occurred only when the water content of soil exceeded 25%, which occurred within 20 m of standing water during floodplain drainage (3 months/yr). Bare soils emitted 60 mmol/day per m of shoreline length; soils covered by stranded macrophyte beds emitted five times this amount. Total emissions were accounted for primarily by flooded forest (94%); macrophyte mats, open water, and exposed soils made only small contributions. The flux-weighted mean  <sup>13</sup>C for the floodplain was -62  8; for D the mean was -271  27. The  <sup>13</sup>C and D were negatively correlated. Overall emission rates were notably lower than for the Amazon. The depth and duration of flooding are considerably less for the Orinoco than for the Amazon floodplain; oxygen over sediments is the rule for the Orinoco but not for the Amazon. The Orinoco data illustrate the difficulty of generalizing emission rates. Current information for tropical America, including revised estimates for inundated area along the Amazon, indicate that methane emissions from tropical floodplains have been overestimated. 
24715144|The Adirondack region of New York has been identified as a hot spot where high methylmercury concentrations are found in surface waters and biota, yet mercury (Hg) concentrations vary widely in this region. We collected stream and groundwater samples for Hg and organic carbon analyses across the upper Hudson River, a 493 km basin in the central Adirondacks to evaluate and model the sources of variation in filtered total Hg (FTHg) concentrations. Variability in FTHg concentrations during the growing seasons (MayOct) of 20072009 in Fishing Brook, a 66-km sub-basin, was better explained by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA), a measure of organic carbon aromaticity, than by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, a commonly used Hg indicator. SUVA was a stronger predictor of FTHg concentrations during the growing season than during the dormant season. Multiple linear regression models that included SUVA values and DOC concentrations could explain 75 % of the variation in FTHg concentrations on an annual basis and 84 % during the growing season. A multiple linear regression landscape modeling approach applied to 27 synoptic sites across the upper Hudson basin found that higher SUVA values are associated with gentler slopes, and greater riparian area, and lower SUVA values are associated with an increasing influence of open water. We hypothesize that the strong HgSUVA relation in this basin reflects distinct patterns of FTHg and SUVA that are characteristic of source areas that control the mobilization of Hg to surface waters, and that the seasonal influence of these source areas varies in this heterogeneous basin landscape.
41490470|Mercury distribution and partitioning was studied in the River Idrijca system, draining the area of the former Idrija mercury mine, Slovenia. Mercury dynamics were assessed by speciation analysis of mercury in water and river bed sediment samples during a 2-year study at locations on the River Idrijca and its major tributaries. Simultaneously, the influence of some major physico-chemical parameters that influence the fate of mercury in the aquatic environment was investigated. The distribution of mercury species in the River Idrijca catchment indicated contamination from mine tailings distributed in the town of Idrija and erosion of contaminated soils. The partitioning between dissolved and particulate mercury phases in river water was found to be mostly controlled by the variable content of suspended solids resulting from changing hydrological conditions and complexation with various ligands present in river water, among which dissolved organic carbon (DOC) seems to be the most important. Overall results indicate that mercury is transported downstream from the mining area mainly as finely suspended material including colloids rather than in the dissolved phase. This riverine transport occurs mostly during short, but extreme hydro-meteorological conditions when remobilization of mercury from the river bed sediments occurs. A significant part of the mercury particulate phase in water corresponds to cinnabar particles. During its transport, important Hg transformation mechanisms that increase the risk of mercury uptake by biota take place, evidenced by the increase in the relative contribution of reactive mercury (Hg R ), dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) and monomethylmercury (MeHg) downstream from the Idrija mine. However, our data revealed relatively low methylation efficiency in this contaminated river system. We attribute this to the site specific physico-chemical conditions responsible for making inorganic mercury unavailable and limiting the capacity of methylating bacteria.
1469985| Concentrations of Al, Fe, Mn, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were measured in the reference and treatment basins of Little Rock Lake (Vilas County, Wisconsin), a low-alkalinity, seepage system (pH 6.1, alkalinity 25 eq/L) during six years of a whole-basin acidification and the first four years of the lake's recovery. The treatment basin was acidified with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in three two-year steps to pH 5.6, 5.1, and 4.7. By the end of year 4 of recovery, treatment basin pH increased to 5.3 as a result of internal alkalinity generation. During acidification, dissolved Mn and Fe (0.4 m pore-size filters) increased at pH 5.6; dissolved Al, Cd, and Zn became elevated at pH 5.1; and dissolved Pb at pH 4.7. Dissolved Cu remained similar in both basins to pH 4.7. Al, Fe and Mn levels declined significantly during the recovery period, approaching values at pH 5.3 intermediate between the concentrations at pH 5.6 and 5.1 during acidification. Dissolved Al and Fe in the reference basin were near the equilibrium levels for solubility of gibbsite (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and amorphous Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> (s). The acidified basin was undersaturated relative to gibbsite, and dissolved Al was limited by pH disequilibrium between the water column and sediments and possibly by Al-DOC precipitation. Dissolved Fe apparently was controlled by solubility of amorphous Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> (s) and Fe-DOC precipitation. Dissolved Mn levels in both basins were consistent with manganite [-MnOOH(s)] solubility. Elevated levels of Cd, Pb, and Zn in the treatment basin during acidification probably resulted from less efficient scavenging of atmospherically-deposited Cd, Pb, and Zn by settling particles. 
1469489|Ecosystems with high rates of nitrogen fixation often have high loss rates through leaching or possibly denitrification. However, there is no formal theoretical context to examine why this should be the case nor of how nitrogen accumulates in such open systems. Here, we propose a simple model coupling nitrogen inputs and losses to carbon inputs and losses. The nitrogen balance of this model system depends on plant (nitrogen fixer) growth rate, its carrying capacity, N fixed/C fixed, residence time of nitrogen and carbon in biomass, litter decay rate, litter N/C, and fractional loss rate of mineralized nitrogen. The model predicts the requirements for equilibrium in a nitrogen-fixing system, and the conditions on nitrogen fixation and losses in order for the system to accumulate nitrogen and carbon. In particular, the accumulation of nitrogen and carbon in a nitrogen-fixing system depend on an interaction between residence time in vegetation and litter decay rate in soil. To reflect a possible increased uptake of soil nitrogen and decreased respiratory cost of symbiotic nitrogen fixers, the model was then modified so that fixation rate decreased and growth rate increased as nitrogen capital accumulated. These modifications had only small effects on carbon and nitrogen accumulation. This suggests that switching from uptake of atmospheric nitrogen to mineral soil nitrogen as nitrogen capital accumulates simply results in a trade-off between energetic limitations and soil nitrogen limitations to carbon and nitrogen accumulation. Experimental tests of the model are suggested.
1469855| Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the waters from Lake Biwa, Japan was fractionated using tangential flow ultrafiltration, and subsequently characterized by fluorescence properties and amino acids. While major dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance (Abs), humic-like fluorescence (Flu) and total hydrolyzed amino acids (THAA) occurred in the less than 5 kDa molecular size fraction, they were not evenly distributed among various molecular size fractions. Flu/Abs ratios increased, and THAA/DOC ratios decreased with decreasing molecular size. Humic-like fluorescence occurred in all molecular size fractions, but protein-like fluorescence only occurred in the 0.1 m-GF/F fraction. Subtle differences in amino acid compositions (both individuals and functional groups) were observed between various molecular size fractions, this may indicate the occurrence of DOM degradation from higher to lower molecular weight. The results reported here have significance for further understanding the sources and nature of DOM in aquatic environments. 
20055264|Proteinaceous components from four Washington coast margin sediments were extracted with base, fractionated into one of four size classes (&lt 3 kDa, 3-10 kDa, 10-100 kDa, &gt 100 kDa), and analyzed for their amino acid contents. Base-extracted material accounts for 30% of the total hydrolyzable amino acids (THAA) and each size fraction has a unique composition, regardless of where the sediment was collected (shelf or upper slope). The &lt 3 kDa size fraction (10% of base-extractable THAA) is relatively enriched in glycine (30 mol%), lysine (5 mol%), and non-protein amino acids (5 mol%). Glycine and non-protein amino acids are common degradation products, and lysine is very surface active. We suggest that the &lt 3 kDa size fraction, therefore, represents a diagenetic mixture of fragments produced during the degradation of larger proteins. The 3-10 and 10-100 kDa size fractions (10% and 42% of base-extractable THAA, respectively) have similar amino acid distributions dominated by aspartic acid ( 30 mol%). Enrichments in Asp is likely due to both preservation of Asp-rich proteins and the production of Asp during degradation. The &gt 100 kDa size fraction (38% of base-extractable THAA) is not dominated by any particular amino acid and can not be modeled by mixing the amino acid compositions of the other size fractions. We propose that the larger size fractions (10-100 kDa and &gt 100 kDa) represent intact, or near intact, proteins. Estimates of isoelectric points and relative hydrophobicity suggest the base-extractable proteins are primarily acidic and have globular structures. Statistical comparisons to several known proteins indicates that the base-extractable component is most similar to planktonic cytoplasmic proteins.
24715182|Bark beetle populations have drastically increased in magnitude over the last several decades leading to the largest-scale tree mortality ever recorded from an insect infestation on multiple wooded continents. When the trees die, the loss of canopy and changes in water and nutrient uptake lead to observable changes in hydrology and biogeochemical cycling. This review aims to synthesize the current research on the effects of the bark beetle epidemic on nutrient cycling and water quality while integrating recent and relevant hydrological findings, along with suggesting necessary future research avenues. Studies generally agree that snow depth will increase in infested forests, though the magnitude is uncertain. Changes in evapotranspiration are more variable as decreased transpiration from tree death may be offset by increased understory evapotranspiration and ground evaporation. As a result of such competing hydrologic processes that can affect watershed biogeochemistry along with the inherent variability of natural watershed characteristics, water quality changes related to beetle infestation are difficult to predict and may be regionally distinct. However, tree-scale changes to soilwater chemistry (N, P, DOC and base cation concentrations and composition) are being observed in association with beetle outbreaks which ultimately could lead to larger-scale responses. The different temporal and spatial patterns of bark beetle infestations due to different beetle and tree species lead to inconsistent infestation impacts. Climatic variations and largescale watershed responses provide a further challenge for predictions due to spatial heterogeneities within a single watershed; conflicting reports from different regions suggest that hydrologic and water quality impacts of the beetle on watersheds cannot be generalized. Research regarding the subsurface water and chemical flow-paths and residence times after a bark beetle epidemic is lacking and needs to be rigorously addressed to best predict watershed or regional-scale changes to soilwater, groundwater, and stream water chemistry.
1468676| In sediment slurry experiments with anoxic marine sediments collected in Cape Lookout Bight, NC, and a site in mid-Chesapeake Bay, the rates of sulfate reduction and ammonium production decrease with increasing dilution of sediment with oxygen-free seawater. The effect of sediment dilution on the rates of these processes can be described by a simple mathematical relationship, and when these rates are corrected for sediment dilution they yield values which agree well with direct measurements of these processes. In sediment slurry studies of amino acid utilization in Cape Lookout Bight sediments, the fermentative decarboxylation of glutamic acid (to -aminobutyric acid) or aspartic acid (to alanine or -alanine) did not occur when either of these amino acids were added to Cape Lookout Bight slurries. The addition of glutamic acid did however lead to a small ( 1%) transient build-up of -aminoglutaric acid. Measured rates of glutamic acid uptake in these slurries also decreased with increasing sediment dilution. Molybdate inhibition experiments demonstrated that dissolved free amino acids represent 1-3% of the carbon sources/electron donors used for sulfate reduction in Cape Lookout Bight sediments. The direct oxidation of amino acids by sulfate reducing bacteria also accounts for 13-20% of the total ammonium produced. Glutamic acid, alanine, -aminoglutaric acid, aspartic acid and asparagine are the major amino acids oxidized by sulfate reducing bacteria in Cape Lookout Bight sediments. 
41490440|Spring snowmelt in the arctic and boreal regions represents the most significant event in the hydrological year. We measured concentrations and fluxes of different carbon species in 2 small contrasting (control v drained) forested peatland catchments in E. Finland between April and June 2008 and compared these to long-term annual fluxes. Measurements were made using a combination of continuous sensors (CO, temperature, pH, discharge) and routine spot sampling (DOC, POC, DIC, CO, CH, NO). The highest concentrations under low flow conditions before the spring flood event, reflecting accumulation and downstream release of gaseous C at the end of the winter period. Over the length of the study mean CH concentrations were 10 higher in the drained site. The snowmelt event was associated with a dilution of DOC and CO, with the drained catchment showing a much flashier hydrological response compared to the control site, and post-event, a slower recovery in DOC and CO concentrations. Fluxes of all carbon species during the snowmelt event were significant and represented 3745% of the annual flux. This highlights the challenge of quantifying aquatic C fluxes in areas with large temporal variability and suggests that inability to "capture" the spring snowmelt event may lead to under-estimation of C fluxes in northern regions.
24715194|Dissolved total nitrogen (Nt) and total organic carbon (TOC) exports were measured from 30 catchments and regions draining 76 % of the Canadian landscape in order to estimate reactive N and organic C runoff losses to estuaries and the conditions that control them. N exports from the catchments were lower than measured in most of Europe and the United States due to significantly less agricultural activity and atmospheric deposition, especially in northern Canada. We produce statistical models using a number of geographical, climatic, agricultural, and population factors in order to predict N and C losses from the remaining regions. Using measured and extrapolated data, we estimated that the Canadian landscape exports 884 and 18,210 ktons of Nt and OC per year. Area normalized exports ranged from 29.4 kg km for the northern Mackenzie River to 299 kg km for the semi-agricultural Saint John. Area normalized OC exports ranged from 495 kg km in the high Arctic to 7,295 to the wetland dominated Broadback River in northern Quebec. N exports were best predicted by the latitude of the catchment centroid, mean slope, population density, runoff and % of the catchment as agricultural land. The best model for predicting TOC exports needed only slope and runoff. The Nt/OC ratio in the rivers unsurprisingly was highest in the southern portion of the country where anthropogenic activities were concentrated.
1469065|Fluxes and stores of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were measured in a small Canadian Shield basin during the 1989 snowmelt. Sulphate flux from the unsaturated zone (14.1 7.3 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) was four times the amount supplied in meltwater and precipitation (3.5 0.4 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). This reflects flushing of soluble SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> from organic and upper mineral soil horizons during melt, which counteracted potential dilution of groundwater SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> levels by large water inputs to the basin. 35.6 12.4 kg SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> entered the saturated zone during melt, supplied equally by leaching from overlying soils and conversion of the capillary fringe to phreatic water due to rising water table levels. Streamflow conveyed 70% of the total SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> export of 10.1 2.3 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, and was largely supplied by groundwater discharge from a wetland in the lower portion of the basin. The remaining 30% of total export was via shallow subsurface flow. Results highlight the importance of unsaturated and saturated zone processes for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> dynamics and export during snowmelt.
1469326| The accumulation of methylmercury (MeHg) to an oligochaete worm Lumbriculus variegatus (Mller) was measured in two different lake sediments in the laboratory. <sup>14</sup>C- labelled MeHg was added to sediments at the nominal concentration of 95 ng/g dw sediment. Groups of six oligochaete worms were exposed in glass beakers to 35 g of spiked sediment for 14 days. The two sediments had organic carbon concentrations of 3.4% and 9.9% and natural selenium concentrations of 1.45 and 0.28 mg/kg (dw), respectively. After two weeks exposure, both the accumulation rate of MeHg and the body residue in the worms were much lower in the sediment having a high organic carbon content. The effect of selenium concentration in the sediment on bioaccumulation of MeHg in Lumbriculus variegatus was measured in one sediment (organic carbon 3.4% and Se 1.45 mg/kg) by adding sodiumselenite (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>) at different concentrations. The added amounts of selenium were 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 15.0, and 50.0 mg Se/kg dry sediment. In this exposure the nominal concentration of MeHg was 102 ng/g dw sediment. The two lowest selenium concentrations did not affect the bioaccumulation of MeHg. But, the dose of 2.5 mg Se/kg resulted in a 25% reduction in the body residue after two weeks exposure. When 15 and 50 mg Se/kg were added to the sediment the accumulation of MeHg in the organisms was decreased by 75% and 86%, respectively, as compared to the reference. 
24716796|The viral mediated transformation of phytoplankton organic carbon to dissolved forms ("viral shunt") has been suggested as a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in marine systems. Despite the potential implications of viral activity on the global carbon fluxes, studies investigating changes in the DOC composition from viral lysis is still lacking. Micromonas pusilla is an ecologically relevant picoeukaryotic phytoplankter, widely distributed in both coastal and oceanic marine waters. Viruses have been found to play a key role in regulating the population dynamics of this species. In this study we used axenic cultures of exponentially growing M. pusilla to determine the impact of viral lysis on the DOC concentration and composition, as estimated from lysate-derived production of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and two fractions of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM): aromatic amino acids (excitation/emission; 280/320 nm; F(280/320)) and marine humic-like fluorescent DOM (320/410 nm; F(320/410)). DOC concentration increased 4.5 times faster and reached 2.6 times higher end concentration in the viral infected compared with the non-infected cultures. The production of F(280/320) and F(320/410) were 4.1 and 2.8 times higher in the infected cultures, and the elevated ratio between F(280/320) and F(320/410) in lysates suggested a higher contribution of labile (protein) components in viral produced DOM than in algal exudates. The TEP production was 1.8 times faster and reached a 1.5 times higher level in the viral infected M. pusilla culture compared with the non- infected cultures. The measured increase in both DOC and TEP concentrations suggests that viral lysis has multiple and opposite implications for the production and export processes in the pelagic ocean: (1) by releasing host biomass as DOC it decreases the organic matter sedimentation and promotes respiration and nutrient retention in the photic zone, whereas (2) the observed enhanced TEP production could stimulate particle aggregation and thus carbon export out of the photic zone.
20456431|We monitored the stable nitrogen isotopic composition (N) of suspended matter and ammonium in the freshwater stretch of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) over a full year to investigate for seasonal evolution and possible co-variation between isotopic signatures. The N value of ammonium remained rather constant during winter (average = +11.4) but increased significantly with the spring and summer bloom, reaching values as high as +70. This enrichment of the ammonium pool in N coincided with significant ammonium depletion during summer period, suggesting a close causal relationship. Based on a semi-closed system approach we deduced an apparent fractionation factor associated with <tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math> utilization (i.e. combining effects of uptake and nitrification) of 18.4 (SE = 2.0), which is similar to values reported in literature. Observed variations of ammonium N could account for about 69% of N variation in suspended matter.
41490534|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important component of the C cycle in forest ecosystems, but dynamics and origin of DOC in throughfall and soil solution are yet poorly understood. In a 2-year study, we analyzed the radiocarbon signature of DOC in throughfall and soil solution beneath the Oa horizon and at 90 cm depth in a Norway spruce forest on a Podzol soil. A two-pool mixing model revealed that throughfall DOC comprised mainly biogenic C, i.e. recently fixed C, from canopy leaching and possibly other sources. The contribution of fossil DOC from atmospheric deposition to throughfall DOC was on average 6% with maxima of 8-11% during the dormant season. In soil solution from the Oa horizon, DO C signature was highly dynamic (range from  8% o to + 103% o), but not correlated with DOC concentration. Radiocarbon signatures suggest that DOC beneath the Oa horizon originated mainly from occluded and mineral associated organic matter fractions of the Oa horizon rather than from the Oi or Oe horizon. Relatively old C was released in the rewetting phase following a drought period in the late summer of 2006. In contrast, the DOC signature indicated the release of younger C throughout the humid year 2007. In soil solutions from 90 cm depth, DOC signatures were also highly dynamic (127%o to + 3%o) despite constantly low DOC concentrations. Similar to the Oa horizon, the lowest DOC signature at 90 cm depth was found after the rewetting phase in the late summer of 2006. Because of the variation in the DOC signatures at this depth, we conclude that DOC was not equilibrated with the surrounding soil, but also originated from overlaying soil horizons. The dynamics of DOC in throughfall and soil solution suggest that the sources of DOC are highly variable in time. Extended drought periods likely have a strong influence on release and translocation of DOC from relatively old and possibly stabilized soil organic matter fractions. Temporal variations as well as the input of fossil DOC needs to be considered when calibrating DOC models based on DOC signatures.
1469905|In the present paper we report partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2</sub>) data obtained off the Belgian coast during 24 cruises. The temporal and spatial resolution of this data set allows us to discuss satisfactorily seasonal and inter-annual variability of pCO<sub>2</sub> in the study area. The dynamics of pCO<sub>2</sub> are described using two approaches: fixed reference stations and area survey cruises. The air-water fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Scheldt estuarine plume and in the outer-plume region are estimated quantitatively, showing that these areas correspond respectively to a net annual source and sink of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. The annually integrated air-water fluxes for the Scheldt estuarine plume range between +1.1 and +1.9 mol m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> as a function of the formulation of the exchange coefficient of CO<sub>2</sub>. The annual net emission of CO<sub>2</sub> from the estuarine plume to the atmosphere is estimated to be between +2.3 to +4.0 Gmol year<sup>-1</sup> which represents 17 to 29% of the estimate reported in the literature for the Scheldt inner estuary.
24715119|The Cefas SmartBuoy network provides a unique insight into the biogeochemical dynamics of the Northern European shelf seas, particularly the North Sea, through high-resolution automated offshore water sampling. We present total dissolved nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) from the Dowsing SmartBuoy site (53.531 N, 1.053 E) from January to October 2010, the first high resolution seasonal (winter-autumn) cycle of DON from the open North Sea. On top of a refractory background DON concentration of approximately 5 M, a rapid increase in DON of a further 5 M is observed over the course of the spring bloom. This rapidly produced DON declines at an estimated net decay rate of between 0.6 and 1.8 M Month. The slow decay suggests that the majority of the additional DON produced during the spring bloom is of semi-labile nature and has a lifetime of weeks to months. The dataset allows us to tightly constrain the budget for water column nitrogen over the winter, spring and summer of 2010 and clearly demonstrates the 'sawtooth' nature of the seasonal cycle of DON in the open North Sea, which has been impossible to resolve with a more traditional ship-based mode of operation. This work highlights the importance of autonomous sampling approaches in better understanding shelf sea biogeochemistry in the future.
1468710|Estimates of sediment entrainment are required for models of particle transport in lakes and estuaries but are difficult to make because of the multiplicity of factors affecting cohesiveness of surficial sediments. We present results of sediment resuspension studies performed in an annular flume calibrated with laser-Doppler velocimetry. In our experiments, using sediments collected from two sites in the R. Raisin which flows into L. Erie and from one site in the western basin of L. Erie near the mouth of the R. Raisin, we applied shear stresses at the sediment-water interface in steps from 2 to 12 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>. Percent water content at the surface of the sediments was either 77 or 74%, and trials were run with and without oxygenating the water overlying the sediments. Entrainment rates as a function of shear stress at the sediment-water interface were best described by a power-law relationship. All but 14% of the variability in the power law expression was due to shear stress and percent water content; the variability not accounted for was due to differences in particle size distributions, chemical properties, and biological activity in the sediments.
1469123|This study combines an analysis of porewater chemistry with new, solid phase wet chemical extractions to examine the seasonal cycling of Fe in vegetated and unvegetated (cyanobacterial mat) saltmarsh sediments. Saltmarsh sediments are shown to contain more solid phase reactive Fe than other marine sediments studied so far. From the partitioning and speciation of solid Fe, and solid/soluble reduced S analysis in 10 sediment cores, we have observed that a majority of solid Fe in these sediments is cycled rapidly and completely between oxidized reactive Fe and reduced Fe as pyrite. Vegetated porewaters showed a lower pH and much higher Fe(II) concentrations on average than unvegetated porewaters in the top 10 cm, whereas sulfate, alkalinity, and sulfide concentrations were similar in the two environments. The amorphous Fe(III) oxide fraction showed a high negative correlation to solid and soluble reduced S (r<sup>2</sup>=-0.86 and -0.71, respectively) in surface vegetated sediments whereas the crystalline Fe(III) oxide fraction showed a high negative correlation (r<sup>2</sup>=-0.96) to sulfide only at depth. Though reactive Fe was observed in unvegetated sediments, no seasonal trend was apparent and the speciation of solid Fe revealed that most of it was reduced. Solid phase and porewater chemistry support the dominant role of the biota (Spartina alterniflora and bacteria) in controlling the reactivity of Fe and suggest that the current definition of solid phase, reactive Fe should be expanded to include crystalline Fe(III) minerals which are available for pyrite formation in saltmarsh sediments. In support of previous saltmarsh studies, we present evidence that the redox cycle of solid Fe is controlled by sulfate reduction and sediment oxidation which respond to both annual cycles (light, temperature) and to short-term, episodic effects such as weather and tides.
4151496|A better understanding of nitrate removal mechanisms is important for managing the water quality function of stream riparian zones. We examined the linkages between hydrologic flow paths, patterns of electron donors and acceptors and the importance of denitrification as a nitrate removal mechanism in eight riparian zones on glacial till and outwash landscapes in southern Ontario, Canada. Nitrate-N concentrations in shallow groundwater from adjacent cropland declined from levels that were often
20519880|Forest clear-cutting followed by soil preparation means disturbance for soil microorganisms and disruption of N and C cycles. We measured fluxes of NO and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in upland soil (podzol) and adjacent peat within a clear-cut forest catchment. Both soil types behaved in a similar way, showing net uptake of NO in the first year after the clear-cutting, and turning to net release in the second. The NO flux dynamics were similar to those of N content in logging residues, as reported from a nearby site. As organic matter is used in the food web of the decomposers, we attempted to explain the dynamics of NO uptake and release by measuring the concurrent dynamics of the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction and the aromaticity of DOC in a soil solution. The labile and most readily available LMW fractions of DOC were nearly absent in the year following the clear-cutting, but rose after two years. The more refractory high molecular weight (HMW) fraction of DOC decreased two years after the clear-cutting. The first year's net uptake of NO could be accounted for by the growth of decomposer biomass in the logging residues and detritus from the degenerating ground vegetation, resulting in immobilization of nitrogen. Simultaneously, the labile, LMW fraction of DOC became almost completely exhausted. The low availability of the LMW fraction could retard the growth and cause the accumulated decomposer biomass to collapse. During the following winter and summer the fraction of LMW clearly increased, followed by increased NO emissions. The presence of LMW DOC fractions, not the concentration of DOC, seems to be an important controller for NO liberation after a major disturbance such as clear-cutting and site preparation. The complex connection between DOC characteristics, nitrification or denitrification merits further studies.
1468687|We investigated subsurface hydrology in two fringing tidal marshes and in underlying aquifers in the coastal plain of Virginia. Vertical distributions of hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic head and salinity were measured in each marsh and a nearby subtidal sediment. Discharge of hillslope groundwater into the base of the marshes and subtidal sediment was calculated using Darcy's law. In the marshes, fluxes of pore water across the sediment surface were measured or estimated by water balance methods. The vertical distribution of salt in shoreline sediments was modeled to assess transport and mixing conditions at depth. Hydraulic gradients were upward beneath shoreline sediments; indicating that groundwater was passing through marsh and subtidal deposits before reaching the estuary. Calculated discharge (6 to 10 liters per meter of shoreline per day) was small relative to fluxes of pore water across the marsh surface at those sites; even where discharge was maximal (at the upland border) it was 10 to 50 times less than infiltration into marsh soils. Pore water turnover in our marshes was therefore dominated by exchange with estuarine surface water. In contrast, new interstitial water entering subtidal sediments appeared to be primarily groundwater, discharged from below. The presence of fringing tidal marshes delayed transport and increased mixing of groundwater and solute as it traveled towards the estuaries. Soil-contact times of discharged groundwater were up to 100% longer in marshes than in subtidal shoreline sediments. Measured and modeled salinity profiles indicated that, prior to export to estuaries, the solutes of groundwater, marsh pore water and estuarine surface water were more thoroughly mixed in marsh soils compared to subtidal shoreline sediments. These findings suggest that transport of reactive solutes in groundwater may be strongly influenced by shoreline type. Longer soil-contact times in marshes provide greater opportunity for immobilization of excess nutrients by plants, microbes and by adsorption on sediment. Also, the greater dispersive mixing of groundwater and pore water in marshes should lead to increased availability of labile, dissolved organic carbon at depth which could in turn enhance microbial activity and increase the rate of denitrification in situations where groundwater nitrate is high.
1469651| A small catchment on the Swedish West Coast has been studied over four years to determine S dynamics by using S isotope ratios. A Norway spruce dominated forest covers the catchment, and small peat areas occur in the lower parts of the catchment. The runoff  <sup>34</sup>S<sub>SO<sub>4</sub></sub> values varied both during the year, and from year to year. Over the period from February 1990 to December 1993, the  <sup>34</sup>S<sub>SO<sub>4</sub></sub> values ranged from -1 to +11. Over the same period, the throughfall  <sup>34</sup>S<sub>SO<sub>4</sub></sub> values ranged from +1 to +15. There was no correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.01; Pr(F) = 0.57) between  <sup>34</sup>S<sub>SO<sub>4</sub></sub> values in throughfall and runoff. Since the only input of S to the catchment is atmospheric deposition, the long-term runoff S mass flux is controlled by the deposition. Therefore, processes in the catchment are responsible for the variation in the runoff  <sup>34</sup>S<sub>SO<sub>4</sub></sub> values. During periods with <sup>34</sup>S<sub>SO<sub>4</sub></sub> enriched runoff, bacterial dissimilatory SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction occurs in the catchment. After very dry periods, oxidation of this reduced S, which is <sup>32</sup>S-enriched, can be traced in runoff. Previous studies of the catchment have not been able to distinguish between: 1) oxidation of reduced S and dry deposition, and 2) reduction and adsorption. From the current study, it can be concluded that adsorption and dry deposition cannot cause the observed variation in runoff  <sup>34</sup>S<sub>SO<sub>4</sub></sub>. 
23359708|Dinoflagellates are recognised as one of the major phytoplankton groups that produce dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), the precursor of the marine trace gas dimethylsulphide (DMS) which has climate-cooling potential. To improve the prospects for including dinoflagellates in global climate models that include DMSP-related processes, we increased the data base for this group by measuring DMSP, DMS-producing enzyme activity (DPEA), carbon, nitrogen and Chl a in nine clonal dinoflagellate cultures (1 heterotrophic and 8 phototrophic strains). Growth rates ranged from 0.11 to 1.92 day -1 with the highest value being for the heterotroph Crypthecodinium cohnii. Overall, we observed two orders of magnitude variability in DMSP content (11364 mM) and detected DPEA in five of the nine strains (0.6159.73 fmol cell -1 h -1 ). Cell volume varied between 454 and 18,439 m 3 and whilst C and N content were proportional to the cell volume, DMSP content was not. The first DMSP measurements for a dinoflagellate from Antarctic waters and a species with diatom-like plastids are included. Lower DMSP concentrations were found in three small athecate species and a dinoflagellate with haptophyte-like plastids. The highest concentrations and production rates tended to be in globally distributed dinoflagellates and the heterotroph. Photosynthetic species that are distributed in temperate to tropical waters showed low DMSP concentrations and production rates and the polar representative showed moderate concentration and a low production rate. Estuarine species had the lowest concentrations and production rates. These data should help refine the inclusion of dinoflagellates as a functional group in future global climate models.
1469811| We examined the influence of temperature and sulfate reduction rates on P-release from aerobic-surfaced, littoral sediments in a cooling reservoir. Annually, significant differences in P release from sediments at two sites (thermal effluent and non-effluent) were related to different temperature regimes, with higher rates of P release and decomposition at higher temperatures. Site-specific differences in solute fluxes were most pronounced in late summer, when water temperatures reached 40C at the effluent site and solute fluxes increased dramatically. The thermal effluent site retained 65% of its annual P load, while the non-effluent site retained 92%. Relative P release (P-release normalized to inorganic carbon fluxes; RPR) data indicated that lake sediments retained P selectively (relative to C) throughout the year, except at the effluent site during late summer when stored P was released in excess of supply rates. Sulfate reduction rates were often typical of those measured in other freshwater lakes, but unusually high rates were measured at the thermal-effluent site especially in early fall and suggested higher DIC fluxes than we measured. These high rates suggest that sulfate reduction rates were overestimated and/or that most sulfide was recycled within the sediments. In any case, the highest sulfate reduction rates did not coincide with the highest P release rates. Furthermore, the total reduced inorganic sulfur content of surficial sediments did not significantly correlate to RPR, although concentrations varied widely throughout the year. Temperature was the only variable examined that significantly correlated to RPR (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.53, P-value = 0.017). Coupling between temperature and sediment P release was likely mediated through temperature effects on bioturbation and microbial metabolic rates. 
1469665| Stable isotopes ( <sup>13</sup>C, D) and radiocarbon were measured in methane bubbles emitted from rice paddies and swamps in southern Thailand. Methane emitted from the Thai rice paddies was enriched in <sup>13</sup>C (mean  <sup>13</sup>C; -51.5  7.1 and -56.5  4.6 for mineral soil and peat soil paddies, respectively) relative to the reported mean value of methane from temperate rice paddies (- 63  5). Large seasonal variation was observed in  <sup>13</sup>C(32) in the rice paddies, whereas variation in D was much more smaller ( 20), indicating that variation in  <sup>13</sup>C is due mainly to changes in methane production pathways. Values of  <sup>13</sup>C were lower in swamps (-66.1  5.1) than in rice paddies. The calculated contribution of acetate fermentation from  <sup>13</sup>C value was greater in rice paddies (mineral soils: 62-81%, peat soils: 57-73%) than in swamps (27-42%). D in methane from Thai rice paddies (-324 7 (n=46)) is relatively higher than those from 14 stations in Japanese rice paddies ranging from -362  5 (Mito: n=2) to -322  8 (Okinawa: n=3), due to higher D in floodwaters. <sup>14</sup>C content in methane produced from Thai rice paddies (1271 pMC) show higher <sup>14</sup>C activity compared with previous work in paddy fields and those from Thai swamps (1102 pMC). 
23359757|Land use changes such as savannah afforestation with eucalypts impact the soil carbon (C) balance, therefore affecting soil CO 2 efflux (F s ), a major flux in the global C cycle. We tested the hypothesis that F s increases with stand age after afforestation, due to an increasing input of fresh organic matter to the forest floor. In a Eucalyptus plantation established on coastal savannahs in Congo, bimonthly measurements of F s were carried out for 1 year on three adjacent stands aged 0.9, 4.4 and 13.7 years and presenting similar growth patterns. Litterfall and litter accumulation on the forest floor were quantified over a chronosequence. Equations were derived to estimate the contribution of litter decomposition to F s throughout the rotation. Litterfall increased with stand age after savannah afforestation. F s , that was strongly correlated on a seasonal basis with soil water content (SWC) in all stands, decreased between ages 0.9 year and 4.4 years due to savannah residue depletion, and increased between ages 4.4 years and 13.7 years, mainly because of an increasing amount of decomposing eucalypt litter. The aboveground litter layer therefore appeared as a major source of CO 2 , whose contribution to F s in old stands was estimated to be about four times higher than that of the eucalypt-derived soil organic C pool. The high litter contribution to F s in older stands might explain why 13.7 years-old stand F s was limited by moisture all year round whereas SWC did not limit F s for large parts of the year in the youngest stands.
1469963|Despite growing attention concerning the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in element cycling of forest ecosystems, the controls of concentrations and fluxes of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) under field conditions in forest soils remain only poorly understood. The goal of this project is to measure the concentrations and fluxes of DON, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and DOC in bulk precipitation, throughfall, forest floor leachates and soil solutions of a deciduous stand in the Steigerwald region (northern Bavaria, Germany). The DOC and DON concentrations and fluxes were highest in leachates originating from the Oa layer of the forest floor (73 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>, 2.3 mg N L<sup>-1</sup> and about 200-350 kg C, 8-10 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). They were observed to be highly variable over time and decreased in the mineral topsoil (17 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.6 mg N L<sup>-1</sup> and about 50-90 kg C, 2.0 to 2.4 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). The annual variability of DOC and DON concentrations and subsequential DOC/DON ratios was substantial in all solutions. The DOC and DON concentrations in throughfall were positively correlated with temperature. The DOC and DON concentrations did not show seasonality in the forest floor and mineral soil. Concentrations were not related to litterfall dynamics but did correspond in part to the input of DOC and DON from throughfall. The throughfall contribution to the overall element fluxes was higher for DON than for DOC. Concentrations and fluxes of DON were significantly correlated to DOC in throughfall and the Oi layer. However, the correlation was weak in Oa leachates. In addition, seasonal and annual variation of DOC/DON ratios indicated different mechanisms and release rates from the forest floor for both components. The concentrations of DOC and DON in forest floor leachates were in most cases dependent neither on the pH value or ionic strength of the solution, nor on the water flux or temperature changes. As a consequence, the DOC and DON fluxes from the forest floor into the mineral soil were largely dependent on the water flux if annual and biweekly time scales are considered.
1469676| Grassland to forest conversions currently affect some of the world's most productive regions and have the potential to modify many soil properties. We used afforestation of native temperate humid grassland in the Pampas with eucalypts as an experimental system to 1) isolate forest and grassland imprints on soil acidity and base cation cycling and 2) evaluate the mechanisms of soil acidification. We characterized soil changes with afforestation using ten paired stands of native grasslands and Eucalyptus plantations (10-100 years of age). Compared to grasslands, afforested stands had lower soil pH (4.6 vs.5.6, p < 0.0001) and 40% lower exchangeable Ca (p < 0.001) in the top 20 cm of the soil. At three afforested stands where we further characterized soil changes to one meter depth, soil became increasingly acidic from 5 to 35 cm depth but more alkaline below 60 cm compared to adjacent grasslands, with few differences observed between 35 and 60 cm. These changes corresponded with gains of exchangeable acidity and Na in intermediate and deeper soil layers. Inferred ecosystem cation balances (biomass + forest floor + first meter of mineral soil) revealed substantial vertical redistributions of Ca and Mn and a tripling of Na pools within the mineral soil after afforestation. Soil exchangeable acidity increased 0.5-1.2 kmol<sub>c</sub>.Ha<sup>-1</sup>.yr<sup>-1</sup> across afforested stands, although no aboveground acidic inputs were detected in wet + dry deposition, throughfall and forest floor leachates. Our results suggest that cation cycling and redistribution by trees, rather than cation leaching by organic acids or enhanced carbonic acid production in the soil, is the dominant mechanism of acidification in this system. The magnitude of soil changes that we observed within half a century of tree establishment in the Pampas emphasizes the rapid influence of vegetation on soil formation and suggests that massive afforestation of grasslands for carbon sequestration could have important consequences for soil fertility and base cation cycles.

1469988|Water draining from the Everglades marshes of southern Florida contains high concentrations of dissolved organic C (DOC), N (DON), and in some locations, P (DOP). These dissolved organic nutrients carry over 90% of the N and organic C, and about 25% of the P exported downstream in the Everglades. Our objectives were to describe the most important aspects of the origin and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Everglades, and to describe the processes controlling its concentration and export. Concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients are influenced by local plant production, decomposition, and sorption equilibrium with peat. The drained peat soils of the Everglades Agricultural Area and the more productive marshes of the northern Everglades produce some of the highest concentrations of DOC and DON in the Everglades watershed. In portions of the marshes of the northern Everglades, P enrichment was correlated with higher local DOC and DON concentrations and greater production of soluble plant matter. Microbial degradation of Everglades DOM was very slow; less than 10% of the DOC was lost after 6 months of incubation in the laboratory and supplements of inorganic nutrients failed to speed the decomposition. Exposure to solar radiation increased the subsequent decay rate of the remaining DOC (25% in 6 mo.). Solar radiation alone mineralized 20.5% of the DOC, 7% of the DON, and degraded about 50% of the humic substances over 21 days in sterile pore-water samples and thus degraded DOM faster than microbial degradation. The humic substances appeared to inhibit biodegradation of the other fractions of the DOC since hydrophilic organic acids decomposed faster when isolated from the humic substances. The fate of DOC and DON is closely linked as indicated by a generally narrow range of C/N ratios. In contrast, high concentrations of DOP were associated with P enrichment (at least in pore water). The DOC was composed of about 50% humic substances, 33% hydrophilic acids, and 15% hydrophilic neutral substances, typical of DOC from other environments, despite the fact that it originates from a neutral to slightly alkaline peatland. Despite high exports of DON (3.9 g m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> from one area), the marshes of the northern Everglades are a sink for DON on a landscape scale. The agricultural fields of the Everglades Agricultural Area, however, exported net quantities of DON. High concentrations of DOC desorbed from the agricultural soils when water with no DOC was added. Sorption experiments indicated that high concentrations of dissolved organic matter flowing into the marshes from the Everglades Agricultural Area could suppress the further desorption of additional soluble organic matter through physicochemical mechanisms. While biological factors, plant production and microbial decomposition are important in producing potentially soluble organic nutrients, physicochemical sorption equilibria, hydrology, and degradation by solar radiation are also likely to control the export of this material on the landscape scale.
1469230| A model of coupled nitrification/denitrification was developed for continental shelf sediments to estimate the spatial distribution of denitrification throughout shelf regions in the North Atlantic basin. Using data from a wide range of continental shelf regions, we found a linear relationship between denitrification and sediment oxygen uptake. This relationship was applied to specific continental shelf regions by combining it with a second regression relating sediment oxygen uptake to primary production in the overlying water. The combined equation was: denitrification (mmol N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>)=0.019<sup>*</sup> phytoplankton production (mmol C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). This relationship suggests that approximately 13% of the N incorporated into phytoplankton in shelf waters is eventually denitrified in the sediments via coupled nitrification/denitrification, assuming a C:N ratio of 6.625:1 for phytoplankton. The model calculated denitrification rates compare favorably with rates reported for several shelf regions in the North Atlantic. The model-predicted average denitrification rate for continental shelf sediments in the North Atlantic Basin is 0.69 mmol N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Denitrification rates (per unit area) predicted by the model are highest for the continental shelf region in the western North Atlantic between Cape Hatteras and South Florida and lowest for Hudson Bay, the Baffin Island region, and Greenland. Within latitudinal belts, average denitrification rates were lowest in the high latitudes, intermediate in the tropics and highest in the mid-latitudes. Although denitrification rates per unit area are lowest in the high latitudes, the total N removal by denitrification (53  10<sup>10</sup> mol N y<sup>-1</sup>) is similar to that in the mid-latitudes (60  10<sup>10</sup> mol N y<sup>-1</sup>) due to the large area of continental shelf in the high latitudes. The Gulf of St. Lawrence/Grand Banks area and the North Sea are responsible for seventy-five percent of the denitrification in the high latitude region. N removal by denitrification in the western North Atlantic (96  10<sup>10</sup> mol N y<sup>-1</sup>) is two times greater than in the eastern North Atlantic (47  10<sup>10</sup> mol N y<sup>-1</sup>). This is primarily due to differences in the area of continental shelf in the two regions, as the average denitrification rate per unit area is similar in the western and eastern North Atlantic. We calculate that a total of 143  10<sup>10</sup> mol N y<sup>-1</sup> is removed via coupled nitrification/denitrification on the North Atlantic continental shelf. This estimate is expected to under-estimate total sediment denitrification because it does not include direct denitrification of nitrate from the overlying water. The rate of coupled nitrification/denitrification calculated is greater than the nitrogen inputs from atmospheric deposition and river sources combined, and suggests that onwelling of nutrient rich slope water is a major source of N for denitrification in shelf regions. For the two regions where N inputs to a shelf region from onwelling have been measured, onwelling appears to be able to balance the denitrification loss. 
1468493|A fertilization experiment was carried out in 3 mesotrophic fens to investigate whether plant growth in these systems is controlled by the availability of N, P or K. The fens are located in an area with high N inputs from precipitation. They are annually mown in the summer to prevent succession to woodland. Above-ground plant biomass increased significantly upon N fertilization in the two 'mid'-succession fens studied. In the 'late'-succession fen that had been mown for at least 60 years, however, plant biomass increased significantly upon P fertilization. The mowing regime depletes the P pool in the soil, while it keeps N inputs and outputs in balance. A long-term shift occurs from limitation of plant production by N toward limitation by P. Hence, mowing is a suitable management tool to conserve the mesothrophic character of the fens.
20519870|Carbon storage in aboveground tree biomass and soil organic matter (in depth of A layer development i.e., up to 20 cm) was studied in 22-32 year-old post-mining sites in the northwest of the Czech Republic. Four replicated sites afforested with different tree species (spruce, pine, larch, oak, lime or alder) were compared with sites left to natural regeneration which were dominated by aspen, birch and willow. No topsoil was applied at the sites; hence carbon accumulation resulted from in situ soil development on alkaline tertiary clays that were dumped on the heaps. In aboveground tree biomass, carbon storage ranged from 17.0  5.9 (mean  SEM) to 67.6  5.9 t ha and the rate of C accumulation increased from 0.60  0.09 to 2.31  0.23 t ha - year (natural regeneration &lt; pine &lt; spruce &lt; oak &lt; lime &lt; alder &lt; larch). Carbon storage in soil organic matter varied from 4.5  3.7 to 38.0  7.1 t ha and the rate of C accumulation in soil organic matter increased from 0.15  0.05 to 1.28  0.34 t ha year at sites in the order: natural regeneration &lt; spruce &lt; pine, oak &lt; larch &lt; alder &lt; lime. Carbon storage in the soil was positively correlated with aboveground tree biomass. Soil carbon was equivalent to 98.1% of the carbon found in aboveground tree biomass at lime dominated sites, but only 21.8% at sites with natural regeneration. No significant correlation was found between C storage in soil and aboveground litter input. Total soil carbon storage was correlated positively and significantly with earthworm density, and occurrence of earthworm cast in topsoil, which indicated that bioturbation could play an important role in soil carbon storage. Hence, not only restoring of wood production, but also restoring of soil community is critical for C storage in soil and whole ecosystem.
1469729| Dynamics of greenhouse gases, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O, and nutrients, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and P, were studied in the sediments of the eutrophic, boreal Lake Kevtn in Finland. Undisturbed sediment cores taken in the summer, autumn and winter from the deep and shallow profundal and from the littoral were incubated in laboratory microcosms under aerobic and anaerobic water flow conditions. An increase in the availability of oxygen in water overlying the sediments reduced the release of CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and P, increased the flux of N<sub>2</sub>O and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, but did not affect CO<sub>2</sub> production. The littoral sediments produced CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> at high rates, but released only negligible amounts of nutrients. The deep profundal sediments, with highest carbon content, possessed the greatest release rates of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and P. The higher fluxes of these gases in summer and autumn than in winter were probably due to the supply of fresh organic matter from primary production. From the shallow profundal sediments fluxes of CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and P were low, but, in contrast, production of N<sub>2</sub>O was the highest among the different sampling sites. Due to the large areal extension, the littoral and shallow profundal zones had the greatest importance in the overall gas and nutrient budgets in the lake. Methane emissions, especially the ebullition of CH<sub>4</sub> (up to 84% of the total flux), were closely related to the sediment P and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> release. The high production and ebullition of CH<sub>4</sub>, enhances the internal loading of nutrients, lake eutrophication status and the impact of boreal lakes to trophospheric gas budgets. 
1469342|We present a conceptual model in which plant-soil interactions in grasslands are characterized by the extent to which water is limiting. Plant-soil interactions in dry grasslands, those dominated by water limitation ('belowground-dominance'), are fundamentally different from plant-soil interactions in subhumid grasslands, where resource limitations vary in time and space among water, nitrogen, and light ('indeterminate dominance'). In the belowground-dominance grasslands, the strong limitation of soil water leads to complete (though uneven) occupation of the soil by roots, but insufficient resources to support continuous aboveground plant cover. Discontinuous aboveground plant cover leads to strong biological and physical forces that result in the accumulation of soil materials beneath individual plants in resource islands. The degree of accumulation in these resource islands is strongly influenced by plant functional type (lifespan, growth form, root:shoot ratio, photosynthetic pathway), with the largest resource islands accumulating under perennial bunchgrasses. Resource islands develop over decadal time scales, but may be reduced to the level of bare ground following death of an individual plant in as little as 3 years. These resource islands may have a great deal of significance as an index of recovery from disturbance, an indicator of ecosystem stability or harbinger of desertification, or may be significant because of possible feedbacks to plant establishment. In the grasslands in which the dominant resource limiting plant community dynamics is indeterminate, plant cover is relatively continuous, and thus the major force in plant-soil interactions is related to the feedbacks among plant biomass production, litter quality and nutrient availability. With increasing precipitation, the over-riding importance of water as a limiting factor diminishes, and four other factors become important in determining plant community and ecosystem dynamics: soil nitrogen, herbivory, fire, and light. Thus, several different strategies for competing for resources are present in this portion of the gradient. These strategies are represented by different plant traits, for example root:shoot allocation, height and photosynthetic pathway type (C<sub>3</sub> vs. C<sub>4</sub>) and nitrogen fixation, each of which has a different influence on litter quality and thus nutrient availability. Recent work has indicated that there are strong feedbacks between plant community structure, diversity, and soil attributes including nitrogen availability and carbon storage. Across both types of grasslands, there is strong evidence that human forces that alter plant community structure, such as invasions by nonnative annual plants or changes in grazing or fire regime, alters the pattern, quantity, and quality of soil organic matter in grassland ecosystems. The reverse influence of soils on plant communities is also strong; in turn, alterations of soil nutrient supply in grasslands can have major influences on plant species composition, plant diversity, and primary productivity.
41490419|The impact of salt-water intrusion on microbial organic carbon (C) mineralization in tidal freshwater marsh (TFM) soils was investigated in a year-long laboratory experiment in which intact soils were exposed to a simulated tidal cycle of freshwater or dilute salt-water. Gas fluxes [carbon dioxide (CO) and methane (CH)], rates of microbial processes (sulfate reduction and methanogenesis), and porewater and solid phase biogeochemistry were measured throughout the experiment. Flux rates of CO and, surprisingly, CH increased significantly following salt-water intrusion, and remained elevated relative to freshwater cores for 6 and 5 months, respectively. Following saltwater intrusion, rates of sulfate reduction increased significantly and remained higher than rates in the freshwater controls throughout the experiment. Rates of acetoclastic methanogenesis were higher than rates of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, but the rates did not differ by salinity treatment. Soil organic C content decreased significantly in soils experiencing salt-water intrusion. Estimates of total organic C mineralized in freshwater and salt-water amended soils over the 1-year experiment using gas flux measurements (18.2 and 24.9 mol C m, respectively) were similar to estimates obtained from microbial rates (37.8 and 56.2 mol C m, respectively), and to losses in soil organic C content (0 and 44.1 mol C m, respectively). These findings indicate that salt-water intrusion stimulates microbial decomposition, accelerates the loss of organic C from TFM soils, and may put TFMs at risk of permanent inundation.
1469028|Methanogenesis was studied in five streams of central and southern Arizona by examining the distribution of methane in interstitial water and evasion of methane in three subsystems (hyporheic, parafluvial and bank sediments). In Sycamore Creek, the primary study site (studied during summer and early autumn), methane content of interstitial water exhibited a distinct spatial pattern. In hyporheic (sediments beneath the wetted channel) and parfluvial zones (active channel sediments lateral to the wetted channel), which were well oxygenated due to high hydrologic exchange with the surface stream and had little particulate organic matter (POM), interstitial methane concentration averaged only 0.03 mgCH<sub>4</sub>-C/L. Bank sediments (interface between the active channel and riparian zone), in contrast, which were typically vegetated, had high POM, low hydrologic exchange and concomitantly low dissolved oxygen levels, had interstitial concentration averaging 1.5 mgCH<sub>4</sub>-C/L. Methane emission from Sycamore Creek, similar to methane concentration, averaged only 3.7 mgCH<sub>4</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> from hyporheic and parafluvial zones as opposed to 170 mgCH<sub>4</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> from anoxic bank sediments. Methane in four additional streams sampled (one sampling date during late winter) was low and exhibited little spatial variation most likely due to cooler stream temperatures. Interstitial methane in parafluvial and bank sediments of all four streams ranged from only 0.005 to 0.1 mgCH<sub>4</sub>-C/L. Similarly, methane evasion was also low from these streams varying from 0 to 5.7 mgCH<sub>4</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. The effects of organic matter and temperature on methanogenesis were further examined by experimentally manipulating POM and temperature in stoppered flasks filled with hyporheic sediments and stream water. Methane production significantly increased with all independent variables. Methane production is greatest in bank sediments that are relatively isolated hydrologically and lowest in hyporheic and parafluvial sediments that are interactive with the surface stream.
1468799| The process of H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation by the phototrophic bacteria Thiocapsa roseopersicina and Chlorobium phaeobacteroides, respectively, was monitored using a Pt-glass-Ag<sup>0</sup>, Ag<sub>2</sub>S electrode combination without liquid junction. Due to the resulting pe(pH) and pH<sub>2</sub>S plottings three steps can be distinguished: oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>S to an S (0) state, oxidation of S (0) to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and oxidation of the remaining H<sub>2</sub>S directly to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Differences between the investigated bacteria exist with respect to their individual oxidation strategies. Thiocapsa apparently stops oxidizing H<sub>2</sub>S at pH<sub>2</sub>S 7.5 (e.g. 10<sup>-7.5</sup>M H<sub>2</sub>S) and shifts to the utilization of the intracellularly stored S (0). In contrast Chlorobium utilizes its extracellularly stored sulfur parallel to the extracellular H<sub>2</sub>S fraction. The corresponding Pt-sensor responses (pe<sub>7</sub> values) were found to be similar to the corresponding partial redox equilibria (p <sub>7</sub> values) of H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation stoichiometries as proposed by Van Niel (1931) and Trper (1964). It is concluded that the recording of pe enables investigators to understand (and control) in situ redox processes, independent of their thermodynamic equilibration, only bound to changes of electroactivity vs. sensor. 
41410598|The efficacy of higher plants at mining Si from primary and secondary minerals in terrestrial ecosystems is now recognized as an important weathering mechanism. Grassland ecosystems are a particularly large reservoir of biogenic silica and are thus likely to be a key regulator of Si mobilization. Herein, we examine the effects of parent material (basaltic and granitic rocks) on the range and variability of biogenic silica pools in grass-dominated ecosystems along two precipitation gradients of Kruger National Park, South Africa. Four soil pedons and adjacent dominant plant species were characterized for biogenic silica content. Our results indicate that although soils derived from basalt had less total Si and dissolved Si than soils derived from granite, a greater proportion of the total Si was made up of biogenically derived silica. In general, plants and soils overlying basaltic versus granitic parent material stored greater quantities of biogenic silica and had longer turnover times of the biogenic silica pool in soils. Additionally, the relative abundance of biogenic silica was greater at the drier sites along the precipitation gradient regardless of parent material. These results suggest that the biogeochemical cycling of Si is strongly influenced by parent material and the hydrologic controls parent material imparts on soils. While soils derived from both basalt and granite are strongly regulated by biologic uptake, the former is a "tighter" system with less loss of Si than the latter which, although more dependent on biogenic silica dissolution, has greater losses of total Si. Lithologic discontinuities span beyond grasslands and are predicted to also influence biogenic silica cycling in other ecosystems.
20456491|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important component in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Yet, the relative importance of different inputs of DOC to the soil solution remains uncertain. Here, we used a large-scale forest girdling experiment to examine how the supply of recent photosynthate to tree roots and their mycorrhizal fungi affects DOC, in particular low-molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA). We also studied effects of tree girdling on non-structural carbohydrates in microorganism, and examined the effects of freezing of soil and the presence of roots in the soil samples on soil solution DOC and LMWOA in this experiment. The concentration of DOC was reduced by 40%, while citrate was reduced by up to 90% in the soil solution by the girdling treatment. Other LMWOA such as oxalate, succinate, formate and propionate were unaffected by the girdling. We also found that girdling reduced the concentrations of trehalose (by 50%), a typical fungal sugar, and of monosaccharides (by 40%) in microorganisms in root-free soil. The effect of freezing on DOC concentrations was marked in samples from control plots, but insignificant in samples from girdled plots. Release of DOC from cell lysis after freezing was attributed equally to roots and to microorganisms. Our observations suggest a direct link from tree photosynthesis through roots and their mycorrhizal fungi to soil solution chemistry. This direct link should impact solute transport and speciation, mineral weathering and C dynamics in the soil compartment. Importantly, our finding of a substantial photosynthate driven production of DOC challenges the paradigm that DOC is mainly the result of decomposition of organic matter.
40343745|Because allochthonous organic matter (OM) loading supplements autochthonous OM in supporting lake and reservoir food webs, C and N elemental and isotopic ratios of sedimenting particulate OM were measured during an annual cycle in a polymictic, eutrophic reservoir. Particulate organic C and N deposition rates were greatest during winter and lowest during spring. C:N ratios decreased through our study indicating that OM largely originated from allochthonous sources in winter and autochthonous sources thereafter. C were influenced by C plant signatures and became increasingly light from winter through autumn. N indirectly recorded the OM source shift through nitrate utilization degree with maximum values occurring in May as nitrate concentrations decreased. Unlike relationships from stratified systems, C decreased with increasing algal biomass. This relationship suggests that minimal inorganic C fixation relative to supplies maintained photosynthetic isotopic discrimination during productive periods. Water column mixing likely maintained adequate inorganic C concentrations in the photic zone. Alternatively, OM isotopic composition may have been influenced by changing dissolved inorganic nutrient pools in this rapidly flushed system. N also recorded increased N fixation as nitrate concentrations declined through autumn. Secondary sediment transport mechanisms strongly influenced OM delivery. Particulate organic C and N deposition rates were 3 x greater near the sediment-water interface. Isotopic ratio mixing models suggested that river plume sedimentation, sediment resuspension, and horizontal advection influenced excess sediment deposition with individual mechanisms being more important seasonally. Our findings suggest that allochthonous OM loading and secondarily-transported OM seasonally supplement phytoplankton production in productive reservoirs.
23359747|The Baltic Sea is known for its ecological problems due to eutrophication caused by high nutrient input via nitrogen fixation and rivers, which deliver up to 70% of nitrogen in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compounds. We therefore measured organic nitrogen uptake rates using self produced 15 N labeled allochthonous (derived from Brassica napus and Phragmites sp.) and autochthonous (derived from Skeletonema costatum) DON at twelve stations along a salinity gradient (34 to 2) from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea in August/September 2009. Both labeled DON sources were exploited by the size fractions 0.2-1.6 m (bacteria size fraction) and >1.6 m (phytoplankton size fraction). Higher DON uptake rates were measured in the Baltic Sea compared to the North Sea, with rates of up to 1213 nmol N l -1 h -1 . The autochthonous DON was the dominant nitrogen form used by the phytoplankton size fraction, whereas the heterotrophic bacteria size fraction preferred the allochthonous DON. We detected a moderate shift from >1.6 m plankton dominated DON uptake in the North Sea and central Baltic Sea towards a 0.2-1.6 m dominated DON uptake in the Bothnian Bay and a weak positive relationship between DON concentrations and uptake. These findings indicate that DON is an important component of plankton nutrition and can fuel primary production. It may therefore also contribute substantially to eutrophication in the Baltic Sea especially when inorganic nitrogen sources are depleted.
1469674|This presents the longest, consistent records of dissolved organic carbon in rivers ever published. This study presents long-term records of organic matter as indicated by water colour that were constructed for three catchments in Northern England for as far back as 1962. Observations show that there have been large increases in DOC concentrations over the period of study with in one case a doubling of the concentration over a period of 29 years. However, in one of the catchments no significant change was observed over a 31-year period. All catchments show common inter-annual control on carbon release in response to droughts, but no step increases in DOC concentrations were observed in response to such perturbations with pre-drought levels being restored within a period 3-4 years. Observed increasing trends do not correlate with changes in river discharge, pH, alkalinity or rainfall, but do coincide with increasing average summer temperatures in the region. The times series of DOC concentration over the period of the record appears stationary, but the distribution of daily values suggests a change in sources of colour over the increasing trend. The evidence supports a view that increases in carbon release are in equilibrium with temperature increases accentuated by land-use factors.
1469448|Although Sphagnum (moss)-dominated, northern peatland ecosystems harbor methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)-producing microorganisms (methanogens) and are a significant source of atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub>, rates of CH<sub>4</sub> production vary widely among different systems. Very little work has been done to examine whether concentrations of cations and metal elements may account for the variability. We examined rates of CH<sub>4</sub> production in peat from five geographically and functionally disparate Sphagnum-dominated peatlands by incubating peat samples in vitro with and without additions of trace metals (Fe, Ni, Co) and base cations (Ca, Li, Na). In peat from the most mineral poor sites, the addition of metals and Na enhanced CH<sub>4</sub> production beyond that observed in controls. The same treatments in mineral rich sites yielded no effect or an inhibition of CH<sub>4</sub> production. None of the treatments affected anaerobic respiration, measured as CO<sub>2</sub> production, in the in vitro incubations of peat except added citrate, suggesting that methanogens, and not the entire anaerobic community, can be limited by the availability of metal elements and cations.
1468815| Seasonal dynamics of S, Ca and N were examined at the Huntington Forest, a northern hardwood ecosystem in the central Adirondacks of New York for a period of 34 months (1985-1988). Solute concentrations and fluxes in bulk precipitation, throughfall (TF) and leachates from the forest floor, E horizon and B horizon were quantified. Both above and below-ground elemental fluxes mediated by vegetation (e.g. uptake, litter inputs, and fine roots production) were also determined. The roles of abiotic and biotic processes were ascertained based on both changes in solute concentrations through the strata of the ecosystem as well as differences between dormant and growing seasons. Concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> were greater in TF than precipitation. Forest floor leachates had greater concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>+NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (9, 6 and 77 eq L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) than TF. There were differences in concentrations of ions in leachates from the forest floor between the dormant and growing seasons presumably due to vegetation uptake and microbial immobilization. Concentrations and fluxes of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were greatest in early spring followed by a rapid decline which coincided with a demand for N by vegetation in late spring. Vegetation uptake (44.7 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) could account for the low leaching rates of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Within the mineral soil, changes with soil depth and the absence of seasonal patterns suggest that cation exchange (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or anion sorption (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) are primarily responsible for regulating solute concentrations. The increase in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration after leachates passed through the mineral soil may be attributed to desorption of sulfate that was adsorbed during an earlier period when SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations would have been greater due to elevated S inputs. 
1469906|Axial profiles of dissolved carbon monoxide (CO) from four surveys of the Scheldt estuary confirmed that the estuary is a source of atmospheric CO, with an emission range of 4-404 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Surface water CO concentration and atmospheric emission were spatially variable, with an order of magnitude difference between the upper and lower estuary in spring, and seasonally variable with highest levels in spring and lowest in winter. Annual CO emission was estimated to be 700 (396-1032) 10<sup>3</sup> mol, equivalent to 0.02-0.05% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) input to the estuary. CO photoproduction rates were an order of magnitude greater in the upper estuary in spring and correlated with DOC concentration. Total CO production from DOC photodegradation was estimated to be 8.5-18 10<sup>3</sup> mol CO d<sup>-1</sup>, equivalent to 0.21-0.44% of riverine DOC input in spring. The deficit between production and emission suggests that microbial CO oxidation accounts for 68% of photoproduced CO, with highest oxidation rates at low salinities. The results indicate that suspended particulate material indirectly influences estuarine CO distribution and emission. Assuming that the Scheldt is representative, estuaries do not contribute significantly to the oceanic or global CO budgets.
4151466|This paper contrasts the natural and anthropogenic controls on the conversion of unreactive N
20456461|Growing concentrations of NO within the atmosphere have been accompanied by decreasing N values, provoking the hypothesis of a global decline in the rate of NO reduction relative to its production in soil. We estimate that the ratio of NO produced to NO reduced within the soil profile has declined by about 10-25% relative to its pre-industrial value. To a smaller extent, a reduction in the uptake of atmospheric NO at the soil surface relative to its emission could also have contributed to the reported isotopic signal. This calls for a greater consideration of the process of NO reduction in soil and its role in the global turnover of NO.
24715330|Long-lived soil organic matter (SOM) pools are critical for the global carbon (C) cycle, but challenges in isolating such pools have inhibited understanding of their dynamics. We physically isolated particulate (>53 m), silt-, and clay-sized organic matter from soils collected over two decades from a perennial C grassland established on long-term agricultural soil with a predominantly C isotopic signature. Silt- and clay-sized fractions were then subjected to a sequential chemical fractionation (acid hydrolysis followed by peroxide oxidation) to isolate long-lived C pools. We quantified C and the natural C isotopic label in the resulting fractions to identify and evaluate pools responsible for long-lived SOM. After removal of particulate organic matter ( 14% of bulk soil C) sequential chemical treatment removed 80% of mineral-associated C. In all mineral-associated fractions, at least 55% of C-derived C was retained 32 years after the switch to C inputs. However, CC increased substantially beginning 25 years after the switch. Radiocarbon-based turnover times ranged from roughly 12003000 years for chemically resistant mineral-associated pools, although some pools turned over faster under C grassland than in a reference agricultural field, indicating that new material had entered some pools as early as 14 years after the vegetation switch. These findings provide further evidence that SOM chemistry does not always reflect SOM longevity and resistance to microbial decomposition. Even measureable SOM fractions that have extremely long mean turnover times (>1500 years) can have a substantial component that is dynamic over much shorter timescales.
24715361|Recent studies have shown that small mountainous rivers (SMRs) may act as sources of aged and/or refractory carbon (C) to the coastal ocean, which may increase organic C burial at sea and subsidize coastal food webs and heterotrophy. However, the characteristics and spatial and temporal variability of C and organic matter (OM) exported from tropical SMR systems remain poorly constrained. To address this, the abundance and isotopic character (C and C) of the three major C pools were measured in two Puerto Rico SMRs with catchments dominated by different land uses (agricultural vs. non-agricultural recovering forest). The abundance and character of C pools in associated estuaries and adjacent coastal waters were also examined. Riverine dissolved and particulate organic C (DOC and POC, respectively) concentrations were highly variable with respect to land use and sampling month, while dissolved inorganic C (DIC) was significantly higher at all times in the agricultural catchment. In both systems, riverine DOC and POC ranged from modern to highly aged (2,340 years before present), while DIC was always modern. The agricultural river and irrigation canals contained very old DOC (1,184 and 2,340 years before present, respectively), which is consistent with findings in temperate SMRs and indicates that these tropical SMRs provide a source of aged DOC to the ocean. During months of high river discharge, OM in estuarine and coastal waters had C isotope signatures reflective of direct terrestrial input, indicating that relatively unaltered OM is transported to the coastal ocean at these times. This is also consistent with findings in temperate SMRs and indicates that C transported to the coastal ocean by SMRs may differ from that of larger rivers because it is exported from smaller catchments that have steeper terrains and fewer land-use types.
1468724|Wetland rice cultivation is one of the major sources of atmospheric methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Global rice production may increase by 65% between 1990 and 2025, causing an increase of methane emissions from a 92 Tg CH<sub>4</sub> y<sup>-1</sup> now to 131 Tg in 2025. Methane production depends strongly on the ratio oxidizing: reducing capacity of the soil. It can be influenced by e.g. addition of sulphate, which inhibits methanogenesis. The type and application mode of mineral fertilizers may also affect methane emissions. Addition of organic matter in the form of compost or straw causes an increase of methane emissions, but methane production is lower for materials with a low C/N ratio. High percolation rates in wetland rice soils and occasional drying up of the soil during the cultivation period depresses methane release. Water management practices aimed at reducing emissions are only feasible during specific periods in the rice growing season in flat lowland irrigated areas with high security of water availability and good control of the water supply. Intermittent drying of soils may not be possible on terraced rice lands. Assuming a 10 to 30% reduction in emission rates per unit harvested area, the global emission may amount to 92 Tg CH<sub>4</sub> y<sup>-1</sup> in 2025. A reduction of global emissions seems very difficult. To develop techniques for reducing CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from wetland rice fields, research is required concerning interactions between soil chemical and physical properties, and soil, water and crop management and methanogenesis. Such techniques should not adversely affect rice yields.
1469827|During the last 60 years, pollution of the groundwater with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> has greatly increased in many parts of Europe, as a consequence of excessive use of manure and synthetic fertilisers. Monitoring of groundwater-fed wetlands indicated that sediments with high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations had the lowest Fe and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> concentrations in the pore water. A comparison of two restored open water fens, differing in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supply via the groundwater, indicated that the redox potential and the sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) reduction rate were lower when the groundwater contained not only SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> but also high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations. The lower SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction rates in the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-rich open water fen were associated with lower PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> concentrations and the presence of plant species characteristic of clear water. In contrast, the higher SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction rates in the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-poor open water fen were associated with very high PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> concentrations and massive development of plant species characteristic of eutrophic environments. Investigations at NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-rich seepage sites in black alder carrs, showed that high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in the pore water caused chlorosis in the alder carr vegetation, due to lower availability of Fe in the pore water and less Fe uptake by the plants. Experimental desiccation of sediments proved that the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-rich seepage sites contained no oxidisable FeS<sub>x</sub>, contrary to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-poor locations, which became acidified and mobilised extremely high amounts of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> due to FeS<sub>x</sub> oxidation. A laboratory experiment showed that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> addition to sediments led to reduced release of Fe and S<sup>2-</sup> and increased release of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, very likely due to the oxidation of reduced Fe and S compounds. Overall, the results confirmed that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is an energetically more favourable electron acceptor in anaerobic sediments than Fe and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and that high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> loads function as a redox buffer, preventing reduction of Fe and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Limited SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction prevents S<sup>2-</sup>-mediated mobilisation of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> from Fe - PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> complexes. At a higher redox potential, reduced Fe, including FeS<sub>x</sub>, was oxidised, increasing the content of Fe(III) capable of binding PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. This prevented increased PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> availability and the concomitant massive development of plant species characteristic of eutrophic environments.
1468690|Nitrate concentration and microbial nitrogen transformations in ground-water-affected sediments of Great South Bay, NY were examined over several annual cycles. Nitrate concentrations are typically higher at 40 cm depth than at the surface, while salinity generally decreases with depth. Denitrification occurs through the sediment core and is organic substrate limited at depth while being nitrate limited near the sediment-water interface. Denitrification accounts for about 50% of the biological NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> decrease between 40 and 15 cm depth interval. Higher than average annual rainfall during 1983 and 1984 was reflected in an elevated water table as well as lower Bay salinities. Conversely, extremely low rainfall occurred in 1985 and 1986, and the water table reached an extreme low in Sep. 1986. Interestingly, the amounts of nitrate in the sediment column of our primary station varied directly with water table height and, presumably, the discharge rate of nitrate enriched groundwater. We suggest that this may be a result of the more efficient removal of advected nitrate by denitrification during low flow conditions.
24716801|Industrial emissions of SO and NO, resulting in the formation and deposition of sulfuric and nitric acids, affect the health of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Since the mid-late 20th century, legislation to control acid rain precursors in both Europe and the US has led to significant declines in both SOS and H in precipitation and streams. However, several authors noted that declines in streamwater SOS did not result in stoichiometric reductions in stream H, and suggested that observed reductions in base cation inputs in precipitation could lessen the effect of air pollution control on improving stream pH. We examined long-term precipitation chemistry (19782010) from nearly 30 sites in the US and Europe that are variably affected by acid deposition and that have a variety of industrial and land-use histories to (1) quantify trends in SOS, H, NHN, Ca, and NON, (2) assess stoichiometry between H and SOS before and after 1990, and (3) examine regional synchrony of trends. We expected that although the overall efforts of developed countries to reduce air pollution and acid rain by the mid-late 20th century would tend to synchronize precipitation chemistry among regions, geographically varied patterns of fossil fuel use and pollution control measures would produce important asynchronies among European countries and the United States. We also expected that control of particulate versus gaseous emission, along with trends in NH emissions, would be the two most significant factors affecting the stoichiometry between SOS and H Relationships among H, SOS, NHN, and cations differed markedly between the US and Europe. Controlling for SOS levels, H in precipitation was significantly lower in Europe than in the US, because (1) alkaline dust loading from the Sahara/Sahel was greater in Europe than the US, and (2) emission of NH, which neutralizes acidity upon conversion to NH, is generally significantly higher in Europe than in the US. Trends in SOS and H in precipitation were close to stoichometric in the US throughout the period of record, but not in Europe, especially eastern Europe. Ca in precipitation declined significantly before, but not after 1990 in most of the US, but Ca declined in eastern Europe even after 1990. SOS in precipitation was only weakly related to fossil fuel consumption. The stoichiometry of SOS and H may be explained in part by emission controls, which varied over time and among regions. Control of particulate emissions reduces alkaline particles that neutralize acid precursors as well as S-containing particulates, reducing SOS and Ca more steeply than H, consistent with trends in the northeastern US and Europe before 1990. In contrast, control of gaseous SO emissions results in a stoichiometric relationship between SOS and H, consistent with trends in the US and many western European countries, especially after 1991. However, in many European countries, declining NH emissions contributed to the lack of stoichiometry between SOS and H. Recent reductions in NO emissions have also contributed to declines in H in precipitation. Future changes in precipitation acidity are likely to depend on multiple factors including trends in NO and NH emission controls, naturally occurring dust, and fossil fuel use, with significant implications for the health of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
23359743|Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions were measured over a period of 3 years at the sub-alpine Swiss CARBOMONT site Rigi Seebodenalp. Here we show, that winter respiration contributes larger than expected to the annual CO 2 budget at this high altitude, rich in belowground organic carbon grassland (715% C by mass). Furthermore the contribution of winter emissions to the annual CO 2 budget is highly dependent on the definition of "winter" itself. Cumulative winter respiration determined over a 6 month period from 15th of October until 15th of April contributed 23.3  2.4 and 6.0  0.3% to the annual respiration during the years under observation, respectively. The insulation effect of snow and a lowering of the freezing point caused by high concentrations of soil organic solutes prevented the soil from freezing. These conditions favored higher soil temperatures resulting in relatively high respiratory losses. The duration of snow cover and micrometeorological conditions determining the photosynthetic activity of the vegetation during snow-free periods influenced the size and the variability of the winter CO 2 fluxes. Seasonal values are strongly influenced by the days at the end and the beginning of the defined winter period, caused by large variations in length of periods with air temperatures below freezing. Losses of CO 2 from the snow-covered soil were highest in winter 2003/2004. These high losses were partially explained by higher temperatures in the topsoil, caused by higher air temperatures just before snowfall. Thus, losses are not a consequence of higher soil temperatures registered during the summer heat wave 2003. However, water stress in summer 2003 might have caused an increment in dead organic matter in the soil providing additional substrate for microbial respiration in the following winter. Although considerable day-to-day fluctuations in snow effluxes were recorded, no conclusive and generally valid relationship could be found between CO 2 losses from the snow pack and snow depth, rate of snow melt, wind speed or air pressure. This suggests that time lags and hysteresis effects may be more important for understanding winter respiration than concurrent environmental conditions in most ecosystems of comparable type.
1469395|Contents of fifteen rare earth elements (REEs) in the seeds of sixty breeds of wheat collected from a seed bank were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The distribution patterns of contents of REEs in wheat seeds (n = 58) were observed and compared with their average level in soils (n = 364). Differences among regions and between spring and winter wheat were tested. Comparison with literature data was also made. The results show that the content of REEs in wheat seed ranges between 10<sup>-11</sup> g g<sup>-1</sup> and 10<sup>-8</sup> g g<sup>-1</sup> 3-4 order of magnitudes lower than that in soils. The distribution patterns are that light REEs enriched and the Eu-anomaly is weak, similar to the soil case. No obvious differences were found among different regions and breeds. The data obtained in this study represent the contents of the fifteen REEs in wheat seeds.
24715359|Soil warming studies have generally demonstrated an ephemeral response of soil respiration to warming suggesting acclimatization to increased temperatures. Many of these studies depict acclimatization as an empirical temperature-respiration model with data collected from late spring through early autumn. We examined the apparent temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in chronically warmed soils over three different timescales: annually, during the growing season, and seasonally during winter, spring, summer, and fall. Temperature sensitivity was evaluated by fitting exponential and flexible temperature functions as mixed effects models. From model coefficients, we estimated annual, growing season, and season-specific Q values, and assessed the ability of model coefficients to predict daily soil respiration rates over a two-year period. We found that respiration in warmed soils can exhibit characteristics of acclimatized temperature sensitivity depending on the timeframe and the function (exponential or flexible) used. Models using growing season data suggested acclimatization while models using data collected in winter or spring indicated enhanced temperature sensitivity with 5 C of warming. Differences in temperature sensitivity affected predicted daily soil respiration rates, particularly in winter and spring. Models constructed over longer timescales overestimated daily respiration rates by as much 1040 % whereas season-specific predictions were generally within 2 % of actual values. Failure to use season-specific models to depict changes in temperature dependence may over- or under-estimate carbon losses due to climate warming, especially during the colder months of the year.
23359735|Over the past decades, the tropical mountain rainforest of southern Ecuador has been threatened by conversion to cattle pastures. Frequently, these pastures are invaded by bracken fern and abandoned when bracken becomes dominant. Changes in land-use (forestpastureabandoned pasture) can affect soil microorganisms and their physiological responses with respect to soil carbon and nutrient cycling. In situ investigations on litter decomposition and soil respiration as well as biogeochemical characterization of the soil were carried out to identify the driving factors behind. The conversion of forest to pasture induced a pronounced increase in CO 2 C effluxes to 12.2 Mg ha -1 a -1 which did not decrease after abandonment. Soil microbial activity and biomass showed a different pattern with lowest values at forest and abandoned pasture sites. With 3445 mg kg -1 (05 cm) microbial biomass carbon (MBC by CFE-method), the active pasture had a more than three times higher value than forest and abandoned pasture, which was among the highest in tropical pasture soils. A shift in the microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acid, PLFA) was also induced by the establishment of pasture land; the relative abundance of fungi and Gram-negative bacteria increased. PLFA fingerprints of the forest organic layer were more similar to pasture than to forest mineral soil. Chemical properties (pH value, exchangeable cations) were the main factors influencing the respective microbial structure. Bracken-invasion resulted in a decrease in the quantity and quality of above- and belowground biomass. The lower organic substance and nutrient availability induced a significant decline in microbial biomass and activity. After pasture abandonment, these differences in soil microbial function were not accompanied by pronounced shifts in the community structure and in soil pH as was shown for the conversion to pasture. A disconnection between microbial structure and function was identified. Similar soil CO 2 C effluxes between active and abandoned pasture sites might be explained by an underestimation of the effluxes from the active pasture site. All measurements were carried out between grass tussocks where fine-root density was about 2.6 times lower than below tussocks. Thus, lower proportions of root respiration were expected than below tussocks. Overall, soil microorganisms responded differently to changes in land-use from forest to pasture and from pasture to abandoned pasture resulting in pronounced changes of carbon and nutrient cycling and hence of ecosystem functioning.
1469986|Mangrove forests are characterized by distinctive tree-height gradients that reflect complex spatial, within-stand differences in environmental factors, including nutrient dynamics, salinity, and tidal inundation, across narrow gradients. To determine patterns of nutrient limitation and the effects of nutrient availability on plant growth and within-stand nutrient dynamics, we used a factorial experiment with three nutrient treatment levels (control, N, P) and three zones along a tree-height gradient (fringe, transition, dwarf) on offshore islands in Belize. Transects were laid out perpendicular to the shoreline across a mangrove forest from a fringe stand along the seaward edge, through a stand of intermediate height, into a dwarf stand in the interior of the island. At three sites, three trees were fertilized per zone for 2 yr. Although there was spatial variability in response, growth by R. mangle was generally nitrogen (N) -limited in the fringe zone; phosphorus (P) -limited in the dwarf zone; and, N- and/or P-limited in the transition zone. Phosphorus-resorption efficiency decreased in all three zones, and N-resorption efficiency increased in the dwarf zone in response to P enrichment. The addition of N had no effect on either P or N resorption efficiencies. Belowground decomposition was increased by P enrichment in all zones, whereas N enrichment had no effect. This study demonstrated that essential nutrients are not uniformly distributed within mangrove ecosystems; that soil fertility can switch from conditions of N to P limitation across narrow ecotonal gradients; and, that not all ecological processes respond similarly to, or are limited by, the same nutrient.
1469982| A time-series analysis of airborne photographs and Landsat thematic mapper (TM and ETM+) images and hydrochemical data were used to examine the effects of land-use change from 1930 to 2001 on solute inputs to Lake Calado, a floodplain lake in the central Amazon. Deforestation from slash-and-burn agricultural activities has dramatically decreased the amount of primary growth upland and flooded forests in the basin. The increasing area that is converted to agricultural plots and pasture in the Lake Calado basin has increased solute loading to the lake from upland tributaries (storm and base flow), bank seepage and overland flow, and decreased throughfall inputs. Whereas solute concentrations in stream water were generally higher in 1992 than 1930, Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations were also considerably higher in 2001 than 1992, likely because of an increase in the number of humans and cattle in the watershed. Estimates of solute inputs to Lake Calado via throughfall indicate that the mass transfer of some major solutes in the throughfall of undisturbed flooded forests can be larger than that from a combination of all other sources in areas that do not have a strong influence from the Solimes River. Chemical gains in rain as it passed through the forest canopy occurred for most major ions and relatively large gains were observed for PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Although often neglected in studies of tropical forest ecosystems, throughfall can be an important source of solutes to relatively undisturbed lake environments in the central Amazon. 
1468774| Measurements of suspended matter, particulate organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon were made over a three year period at stations spanning  150 km of the tidal freshwater Hudson River. Suspended matter concentrations varied from year-to-year and were not related to freshwater discharge. The increase in suspended matter with depth in vertical profiles suggests that, during medium to low flow conditions, resuspension of bottom sediments was as important a source of sediment as loadings from tributaries. Particulate organic carbon showed significant variability among stations, and both autochthonous primary production and detrital organic matter are contributing to POC standing stocks. Dissolved organic carbon represented over half of the total organic carbon in the water column and showed little variation among stations. Examining downstream changes in transport showed that there was significant production of both suspended matter and POC within the study reach during the ice-free season. Tributary loadings within the study reach do not appear to be the cause of these increases in downstream transport. Dissolved organic carbon behaved conservatively in that there was no evidence for net production or net consumption within the river. The spatial/temporal patterns and analyses of transport suggest that suspended matter and POC, but not DOC, were controlled to a significant extent by processes occurring within the river and were not simply related to loadings from outside. 
1468890|The distribution of soil P among inorganic and organic forms was examined in prairie and boreal forest soil profiles from Saskatchewan, Canada. A sequential extraction procedure was employed to separate P into labile and stable inorganic (P<sub>i</sub>) and organic (P<sub>o</sub>) fractions. Profile depth, climate, vegetation, and cultivation all had a major influence on the distribution of P which is attributed to differing intensities of pedogenic processes such as weathering and leaching, and their relationship to P transformations in the soil environment.
1468514|Arsenic speciation data are presented for pore waters squeezed from some native and anthropogenically influenced sediments. Ten stations were sampled with a box corer (to 20 cm) at two British Columbia coastal sites that are influenced by mine-tailings discharges. These are Rupert Inlet and Alice Arm as well as their associated systems of Quatsino Sound/Holberg Inlet and Hastings Arm respectively. Total dissolved arsenic concentrations ( As<sub>D</sub>) usually exhibited subsurface maxima at 5-10 cm and were generally related to solid phase arsenic (As<sub>p</sub>) levels, but there was also a dependence on the nature of the substrate. Tailings exhibited both the lowest (Rupert Inlet) and the highest (Alice Arm)  As<sub>D</sub> values. Inorganic arsenicals, arsenate (AsV) and arsenite (AsIII) constituted the majority (> 90%) of the dissolved species but every sample contained organoarsenicals. This is the first report of mono-, di- and tri-methylated arsenic species in marine interstitial water. A strong positive correlation between the sum of the methylarsenic compounds ( MeAs) and the total dissolved arsenic ( As<sub>D</sub>) was found, indicating in situ microbial methylation similar to that observed in non-aquatic systems. Flux values for arsenic at the sediment-water interface suggest that, at present, there is no significant mobilization of arsenic from these mine-derived sediments into the water column.
24715099|Soil microorganisms play a pivotal role in soil organic matter (SOM) turn-over and their diversity is discussed as a key to the function of soil ecosystems. However, the extent to which SOM dynamics may be linked to changes in soil microbial diversity remains largely unknown. We characterized SOM degradation along a microbial diversity gradient in a two month incubation experiment under controlled laboratory conditions. A microbial diversity gradient was created by diluting soil suspension of a silty grassland soil. Microcosms containing the same sterilized soil were re-inoculated with one of the created microbial diversities, and were amended with C labeled wheat in order to assess whether SOM decomposition is linked to soil microbial diversity or not. Structural composition of wheat was assessed by solid-state C nuclear magnetic resonance, sugar and lignin content was quantified and labeled wheat contribution was determined by C compound specific analyses. Results showed decreased wheat O-alkyl-C with increasing microbial diversity. Total non-cellulosic sugar-C derived from wheat was not significantly influenced by microbial diversity. Carbon from wheat sugars (arabinose-C and xylose-C), however, was highest when microbial diversity was low, indicating reduced wheat sugar decomposition at low microbial diversity. Xylose-C was significantly correlated with the Shannon diversity index of the bacterial community. Soil lignin-C decreased irrespective of microbial diversity. At low microbial diversity the oxidation state of vanillyllignin units was significantly reduced. We conclude that microbial diversity alters bulk chemical structure, the decomposition of plant litter sugars and influences the microbial oxidation of total vanillyllignins, thus changing SOM composition.
20456398|We explored the influence of small-scale spatial variation in soil moisture on CO fluxes in the high Arctic. Of five sites forming a hydrological gradient, CO was emitted from the three driest sites and only the wettest site was a net sink of CO. Soil moisture was a good predictor of net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Higher gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) was linked to higher bryophyte biomass and activity in response to the moisture conditions. Ecosystem respiration (
1469950| Anthropogenic N inputs and riverine export were determined for a meso-scale river basin in one of the most developed and economically important regions of South America. The Piracicaba River basin is located in southeastern Brazil and drains into a tributary of the Paran River. The basin supports over 3 million people (about 2% of the population of Brazil) with intensive agricultural and industrial activities. During two years from 1995 to 1997, biweekly samples were collected at 10 stations along the Piracicaba River and its tributaries for analyses of dissolved and particulate N. The average annual flux of dissolved inorganic N and total N increased by a factor of 15 and 20 times, respectively, from the headwaters to the lower reaches of the main channel, whereas discharge increased by only 7 times. On a per area basis, the export of TN varied according to land use and was significantly correlated to the net input of anthropogenic N. Among 10 sub-catchments composing the basin, areas mostly covered by pasture and forest had the lowest export, whereas more agricultural and urban areas had higher export. The amount of N exported from each sub-catchment varied widely, but inputs were consistently higher than fluvial outputs. Losses and retention of N occurred throughout the basin but were especially high in the sub-catchment with a main-stem reservoir, suggesting that aquatic processing plays an important role in controlling riverine N export. Total net anthropogenic input to the Piracicaba River basin was 4,500 ( 900) kg N km<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of which about 40% was exported via fluvial outputs. 
1469937|Water and dissolved nitrogen flows through the hyporheic zone of a 3rd-order mountain stream in Hokkaido, northern Japan were measured during a small storm in August 1997. A network of wells was established to measure water table elevations and to collect water samples to analyze dissolved nitrogen concentrations. Hydraulic conductivity and the depth to bedrock were surveyed. We parameterized the groundwater flow model, MODFLOW, to quantify subsurface flows of both stream water and soil water through the hyporheic zone. MODFLOW simulations suggest that soil water inflow from the adjacent hill slope increased by 1.7-fold during a small storm. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) in soil water from the hill slope were the dominant nitrogen inputs to the riparian zone. DON was consumed via mineralization to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the hyporheic zone. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was the dominant nitrogen species in the subsurface, and showed a net release during both base and storm flow. Nitrate appeared to be lost to denitrification or immobilized by microorganisms and/or vegetation in the riparian zone. Our results indicated that the riparian and hyporheic system was a net source of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to the stream.
1469560|The importance of heterotrophic nitrification was studied in soil from a mixed-conifer forest. Three sites in the forest were sampled: a clear cut area, a young stand and a mature stand. In the mature stand, the mineral soil (0-10 cm) and the organic layer were sampled separately. Gross rates of N mineralization and nitrification were measured by <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> isotopic pool dilution, respectively. The rates of autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrification were distinguished by use of acetylene as a specific inhibitor of autotrophic nitrification. In samples supplemented with <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and treated with acetylene, no <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was detectable showing that the acetylene treatment effectively blocked the autotrophic nitrification, and that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was not a substrate for heterotrophic nitrification. In the clear cut area, autotrophic nitrification was the most important NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> generating process with total nitrification (45 ug N kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) accounting for about one-third of gross N mineralization (140 ug N kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). In the young and mature forested sites, gross nitrification rates were largely unaffected by acetylene treatment indicating that heterotrophic nitrification dominated the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> generating process in these areas. In the mature forest mineral and organic soil, nitrification (heterotrophic) was equal to only about 5% of gross mineralization (gross mineralization rates of 90 ug N kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> mineral; 550 ug N kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> organic). The gross nitrification rate decreased from the clear cut area to the young forest area to the mineral soil of the mature forest (45; 17; 4.5 ug kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> respectively). The <sup>15</sup>N isotope pool dilution method, combined with acetylene as an inhibitor of autotrophic nitrification provided an effective technique for assessing the importance of heterotrophic nitrification in the N-cycle of this mixed-conifer ecosystem.
20456444|Equilibrium carbon stock is the result of a balance between inputs and outflows to the pool. Changes in land-use are likely to alter such balance, resulting in different carbon stores under different land-use types in addition to the impacts of global climate change. In an agro-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, northern China, we investigated productivity and belowground carbon and nitrogen stores under six different types of land-uses, namely free grazing (FG), grazing exclusion (GE), mowing (MW), corn plantation (CP), fallow (FL), and alfalfa pasture (AP), and their impacts on litter and fine roots in semiarid grassland ecosystems. We found that there were great variations in aboveground net primary production (ANPP) across the six land-use types, with CP having markedly high ANPP; the FG had significantly reduced soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen stores (SON) to 100 cm depth compared with all other types of land uses, while very little litter accumulation was found on sites of the FG and CP. The top 20 cm of soils accounted for about 80% of the root carbon and nitrogen, with very little roots being found below 50 cm. About 60% of SOC and SON were stored in the top 30 cm layer. Land-use change altered the inputs of organic matters, thus affecting SOC and SON stores accordingly; the MW and GE sites had 59 and 56% more SOC and 61% more SON than the FG. Our estimation suggested that restoring severely degraded and overgrazed grass-lands could potentially increase SOC and SON stores by more than 55%; conversion from the native grasses to alfalfa could potentially double the aboveground biomass production, and further increase SOC and SON stores by more than 20%. Our study demonstrated significant carbon and nitrogen storage potential of the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China through land-use changes and improved management in the context of mitigating global climate change.
1469870|Dissolved and particulate, organic and inorganic N, P and Si were measured in the main stream and 15 major tributaries of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) in April-May 1997. The nutrient concentrations are related to water discharge, suspended particulate matter, anthropogenic activities etc. The nutrient levels were quite low in the upper reaches, and significantly increased in the main stream in a region of 2000-3000 km inland from the river mouth. The northern tributaries contribute more nutrients to the Changjiang than the southern tributaries. Based on atomic ratios of N, P and Si, the limiting nutrient in the Changjiang drainage basin was P. The nutrient yields in the Changjiang and its major tributaries indicated high rates of transport of nutrients within the watersheds. Concentrations of nitrate in the Changjiang have increased, but there have been no systematic trends for phosphate and silicic acid since 1980. The DIN/P ratios and DIN/Si ratios increased. The DIN/P and DIN/Si ratios may be expected to continue to increase after construction of the "Three Gorges Dam", which will exercise a great deal of influence on the ecological environment of the Changjiang estuary and its adjacent sea.
1469853|Organic carbon storage and turnover were altered in soils formed from volcanic ash (Andisols) as a result of conversion of tropical forest to pasture and sugarcane cropland. Changes in soil carbon storage after approximately a century of each land use were estimated using stable carbon isotope values and carbon contents. Total organic carbon stored in soils varied as a result of management, with pasture soils showing net carbon gain and sugarcane soils showing net carbon loss. In pasture soils, increases in carbon at depth (40 to 80 cm) are below the rooting zone of the introduced (C4) vegetation, and have stable carbon isotopic values indicative of forest (C3) plants. Within the pasture rooting zone (0-40 cm) the isotopic data reveals that additions of pasture (C4) organic matter have been offset by losses of C3 carbon. The concentration of Fe/Al oxides (soil minerals that bind with organic matter to form oxide-humus complexes) appear to control the quantity of carbon stored in soils, as well as the difference in the depth and magnitude of carbon storage changes that occur with each type of land use change. Sugarcane land use appears to induce dissociation of Fe/Al oxide-humus complexes and loss of oxide-associated organic matter from the profile. In pastures, Fe/Al oxide-humus complexes are translocated to deeper horizons in the soils, resulting in greater profile carbon storage and longer apparent turnover time of carbon stored below 50 cm depth. In this high precipitation region, carbon losses from the soil appear to occur via downward transport, either as colloids or in solution, in addition to the generally assumed pathway of flux to the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub>.
20456504|In acid forest soils nitrate (<tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math>) from anthropogenic nitrogen deposition is retained at levels beyond what can be explained by known biological mechanisms. A number of researchers have hypothesized that abiotic <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> incorporation into soil organic matter might be responsible for this phenomenon, however studies have been limited to a few temperate forest sites. The goal of this study was to determine if abiotic <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> incorporation is important across a wide range of soil types. We collected 44 soils from a number of different ecosystem types in North and South America and measured the extent of abiotic <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> incorporation. Significant abiotic nitrate incorporation did not occur in any of the soils examined. We show that the apparent abiotic incorporation observed in previous studies is likely the result of iron interference with <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> measurements. Our results suggest that abiotic <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> incorporation is not a likely explanation for the high rates of <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> retention observed in some ecosystems.
20456529|After vegetation fires considerable amounts of severely or partly charred necromass (referred to here as char) are incorporated into the soil, with long-term consequences for soil C and N dynamics and thus N availability for primary production and C and N transport within the soil column. Considering results reported in the pyrolysis literature in combination with those obtained from controlled charring of plant material and soil organic matter (SOM), it has become clear that common models claiming char as a graphite-like material composed mainly of highly condensed polyaromatic clusters may be oversimplified. Instead, I suggest a concept in which char is a heterogeneous mixture of heat-altered biopolymers with domains of relatively small polyaromatic clusters, but considerable substitution with N, O and S functional groups. Such a concept allows fast oxidation facilitating both microbial attack and dissolution. Although, char is commonly believed to degrade more slowly than litter, over the long term and under oxic conditions, char may degrade to an extent that it becomes indistinguishable from naturally formed SOM. Oxygen depletion or environments with low microbial activity may be necessary for char to survive without major chemical alteration and in considerable amounts for millennia or longer.
1469735| Large increases in nitrogen (N) inputs to terrestrial ecosystems typically have small effects on immediate N outputs because most N is sequestered in soil organic matter. We hypothesized that soil organic N storage and the asynchrony between N inputs and outputs result from rapid accumulation of N in stable soil organic pools. We used a successional sequence on floodplains of the Tanana River near Fairbanks, Alaska to assess rates of stable N accumulation in soils ranging from 1 to 500+ years old. One-year laboratory incubations with repeated leaching separated total soil N into labile (defined as inorganic N leached) and stable (defined as total minus labile N) pools. Stable N pools increased faster (2 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) than labile N (0.4 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) pools during the first 50 years of primary succession; labile N then plateaued while stable and total N continued to increase. Soil C pools showed similar trends, and stable N was correlated with stable C (r<sup>2</sup>=0.95). From 84 to 95% of soil N was stable during our incubations. Over successional time, the labile N pool declined as a proportion of total N, but remained large on an aerial basis (up to 38 g N m<sup>-2</sup>). The stoichiometry of stable soil N changed over successional time; C:N ratios increased from 10 to 22 over 275 years (r<sup>2</sup>=0.69). A laboratory <sup>15</sup>N addition experiment showed that soils had the capacity to retain much more N than accumulated naturally during succession. Our results suggest that most soil N is retained in a stable organic pool that can accumulate rapidly but is not readily accessible to microbial mineralization. Because stable soil organic matter and total ecosystem organic matter have flexible stoichiometry, net ecosystem production may be a poor predictor of N retention on annual time scales. 
1469426|Sedimentation patterns in nine lake basins were examined where catchments were either clearcut, burned in recent history, or where there has been no recorded disturbance and the catchments consist of mature forests. Pronounced declines in sedimentation rates were observed in eight of eleven cores after 1980, in reference, clearcut, and burn lakes. The degree of change was positively correlated with the drainage ratio (catchment area: lake area), but was unrelated to land use history. The decline in sedimentation rates after 1980 coincide with a 60% decrease in catchment runoff and precipitation measured over the same time interval at the nearby Experimental Lakes Area. These results indicate that climatic changes over the past 20 years have had a greater effect on catchment erosion than either clearcutting or fire.
1469444| The influence of site fertility on soil microbial biomass and activity is not well understood but is likely to be complex because of interactions with plant responses to nutrient availability. We examined the effects of long-term (8 yr) fertilization and litter removal on forest floor microbial biomass and N and C transformations to test the hypothesis that higher soil resource availability stimulates microbial activity. Microbial biomass and respiration decreased by 20-30% in response to fertilization. Microbial C averaged 3.8 mg C/g soil in fertilized, 5.8 mg C/g in control, and 5.5 mg C/g in litter removal plots. Microbial respiration was 200 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in fertilized plots, compared to 270 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in controls. Gross N mineralization and N immobilization did not differ among treatments, despite higher litter nutrient concentrations in fertilized plots and the removal of substantial quantities of C and N in litter removal plots. Net N mineralization was significantly reduced by fertilization. Gross nitrification and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> immobilization both were increased by fertilization. Nitrate thus became a more important part of microbial N cycling in fertilized plots even though NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> availability was not stimulated by fertilization. Soil microorganisms did not mineralize more C or N in response to fertilization and higher litter quality; instead, results suggest a difference in the physiological status of microbial biomass in fertilized plots that influenced N transformations. Respiration quotients (qCO<sub>2</sub>, respiration per unit biomass) were higher in fertilized plots (56 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C mg C<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) than control (48 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C mg C<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) or litter removal (45 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C mg C<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>), corresponding to higher microbial growth efficiency, higher proportions of gross mineralization immobilized, and lower net N mineralization in fertilized plots. While microbial biomass is an important labile nutrient pool, patterns of microbial growth and turnover were distinct from this pool and were more important to microbial function in nitrogen cycling. 
1469644|Nitrogen is often a limiting factor to net primary productivity (NPP) and other processes in terrestrial ecosystems. In most temperate freshwater ecosystems, when nitrogen becomes limiting to NPP, populations of N-fixing cyanobacteria experience a competitive advantage, and begin to grow and fix nitrogen until the next most limiting resource is encountered; typically phosphorus or light. Why is it that N-fixing plants do not generally function to overcome N limitation in terrestrial ecosystems in the same way that cyanobacteria function in aquatic ecosystems? To address this question in a particular ecosystem, one must first know whether the flora includes a potential set of nitrogen fixers. I suggest that the presence or absence of N-fixing plant symbioses is foremost an evolutionary consideration, determined to a large extent by constraints on the geographical radiation of woody members of the family Fabaceae. Ecological factors such as competition, nutrient deficiencies, grazing and fire are useful to explain the success of N-fixing plants only when considered against the geographical distribution of potential N-fixers.
24715340|Senesced vegetation is exposed to a wide range of salt concentrations in surface waters resulting from human activities which include deicing salts and irrigation water chemistry. Both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and salt concentrations are rising in northern hemisphere watersheds, yet there has been little investigation of sodium as a potential mechanism for DOC increases. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of solution sodicity and salinity on DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) leaching from five types of senesced and cut vegetation. Vegetation was soaked for 24 h in a series of sodium chloride (NaCl)calcium chloride (CaCl) solutions with sodium adsorption ratios (SAR) of 2, 10, or 30 and electrical conductivities of 0.1 dS m through 3.0 dS m. Vegetation was also soaked in a sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO) solution at SAR = 30 and stream water from local watersheds with a range of sodicity and salinity. The mass of both DOC and DON released increased as SAR increased in the NaCl solutions, but the total salinity had inconsistent effects on DOC and DON release. NaHCO leached similar amounts of DOC and DON as NaCl. The SAR of the stream water solutions was able to explain 88 % of the variability in DOC leached from vegetation (p < 0.05). The results indicated that sodicity, quantified by SAR, had a significant impact on DOC and DON leaching from senesced vegetation and could be a potential mechanism to explain the observed increases in surface water DOC.
1468506|Two adjacent catchments in the Otway Ranges of Victoria, Australia (Redwater and Clearwater) produce water with markedly different concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during summer. Water from Redwater Creek had a DOC concentration of 32 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, while water from Clearwater Creek had a DOC concentration of 3.8 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. Examination of the catchments revealed that while climate, topography, vegetation and land use were similar, the soils were different. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the concentration and chemical composition of DOC in stream waters and the nature of soils in the two catchments. Soil mapping determined that clayey soils formed on Cretaceous sediments (Cretaceous soils) occurred throughout both catchments, but that Redwater Catchment also contained a large area (39%) of sandy soils formed on Tertiary sediments (Tertiary soils). The concentration of DOC in forest floor leachate was high in both the Tertiary and Cretaceous areas; however, the concentration of DOC in water draining areas dominated by Tertiary soils was greater than that in water draining areas dominated by Cretaceous soils. Laboratory experiments showed that the Cretaceous soils had higher adsorption capacities for forest floor leachate DOC than the Tertiary soils. The difference in DOC concentrations of the streams was therefore attributed to the difference in adsorption capacity of catchment soils for DOC. Adsorption capacities of the soils were found to be a function of their clay contents and specific surface areas. Solid-state <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and pyrolysis-mass spectrometry were used to determine the chemical structure of DOC found in streams and forest floor leachate samples and that remaining in solution after interaction with soil. Chemistry of DOC in forest floor leachate was similar before and after interaction with soil, indicating no preferential adsorption of a particular type of carbon. Thus, differences between the chemical structure of stream DOC and forest floor leachate DOC could be attributed to microbial modifications during its movement through soils and into the streams, rather than losses by adsorption.
24715125|Micro-organisms are vital for the functioning of all food webs and are the major drivers of the global biogeochemical cycles. The microbial community compositions and physicochemical conditions of the different water masses in the North Sea, a biologically productive sea on the northwestern European continental shelf, were studied during two summer cruises, in order to provide detailed baseline data for this region and examine its microbial biogeography. For each cruise the stations were clustered according to their physicochemical characteristics and their microbial community composition. The largest cluster, which covered most of the central and northern North Sea, consisted of stations that were characterized by a thermally stratified water column and had low chlorophyll a autofluorescence and generally low microbial abundeances. The second main cluster contained stations that were dominated by picoeukaryotes and showed the influence of influxes of North Atlantic water via the English Channel and south of the Shetland Islands. The third main cluster was formed by stations that were dominated by cyanobacteria and nanoeukaryotes in the reduced salinity Norwegian Coastal and Skagerrak waters, while the fourth cluster represented the German Bight, a region with strong reverine input, high nutrient concentrations, and consequently high heterotrophic bacterial and viral abundances. Despite the complex and dynamic hydrographic nature of the North Sea, the consistent distinctions in microbiology between these different hydrographic regions during both cruises illustrate the strong links between the microbial community and its environment, as well as the possibility to use microorganisms for long-term monitoring of environmental change.
1468788|A static chamber technique was used weekly from spring thaw to winter freezing to measure methane emissions from 10 sites representing subarctic fens and temperate swamps and bogs. Rates of < 200 mg CH<sub>4</sub>m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> were recorded in subarctic fens: within-site emissions were primarily controlled by the evolution of the peat thermal regime, though significant releases during spring thaw were recorded at some sites. Between subarctic fens, topography and water table elevation were important controls on methane emissions, with the general sequence: pool = horizontal fen > string. Emission rates from the 2 swamp sites were lower (<20 mg CH<sub>4</sub>m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>), except during the spring thaw and when the sites were saturated. The low water table (< 80 cm depth) in abnormally dry years reduced emission rates; rates were also low from a swamp site which had been drained and cleared of vegetation for horticulture. Methane emission rates were also low (<5 mg CH<sub>4</sub>m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>) from 2 ombrotrophic bog sites. Laboratory measurements of rates of methane production under anaerobic conditions and methane consumption under aerobic conditions revealed that production rates were generally highest in the surface layers (0 to 25 cm depth); production was high in the fens and very low in the bogs. The swamp samples were able to produce methane under anaerobic conditions, but were also able to consume methane under aerobic conditions. Annual methane emission rates are estimated to be 1 to 10 g CH<sub>4</sub>m<sup>-2</sup> from the fens, 1 to 4 g CH<sub>4</sub>m<sup>-2</sup> from the swamps and <0.2 g CH<sub>4</sub>m<sup>-2</sup> from the bogs and drained swamp.
1469428| Contamination of surface- and groundwaters as a result of anthropogenic nitrate loading is of concern in regions subjected to intense agricultural activities. The capacity of watersheds to absorb, process or release nitrate to outflow drainage waters, however, is poorly constrained. An investigation of in-stream denitrification was conducted in a small stream draining a heavily fertilized agricultural watershed by analyzing natural isotopic abundances of nitrate-nitrogen. Using  <sup>15</sup>N isotopic signatures, we show that denitrification plays a large role in reducing nitrate levels during stream transport over a relatively short distance. We found in-situ nitrate losses of up to 50% and a corresponding shift in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>- <sup>15</sup>N values of 10 over a 600 m distance downstream consistent with denitrification. Our results suggest that in-stream nitrate losses must be considered when examining nitrate cycling and contamination in watersheds. Not only should attempts to identify nitrate contamination sources using NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>- <sup>15</sup>N signatures be carried out with caution (as nitrate-N isotopic values can be altered during stream transport such that they no longer reflect the original nitrate source), but in-stream measures of nitrate concentrations aimed at monitoring contamination levels may underestimate nitrate inputs to surface waters due to denitrification during transport. 
1468602|Relationships between surface-water discharge, water chemistry, and watershed geology were investigated to evaluate factors affecting the sensitivity of drainage waters in the Adirondack region of New York to acidification by atmospheric deposition. Instantaneous discharge per unit area was derived from relationships between flow and staff-gage readings at 10 drainage basins throughout the region. The average chemical composition of the waters was assessed from monthly samples collected from July 1982 through July 1984. The ratio of flow at the 50-percent exceedence level to the flow at the 95-percent exceedence level of flow duration was negatively correlated with mean values of alkalinity or acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC), sum of basic cations (SBC), and dissolved silica, for basins containing predominantly aluminosilicate minerals and little or no carbonate-bearing minerals. Low ratios are indicative of systems in which flow is predominately derived from surface- and ground-water storage, whereas high ratios are characteristic of watersheds with variable flow that is largely derived from surface runoff. In an evaluation of two representative surface-water sites, concentrations of ANC, SBC, and dissolved silica, derived primarily from soil mineral weathering reactions decreased with increasing flow. Furthermore, the ANC was highest at low flow when the percentage of streamflow derived from ground water was maximum. As flow increased, the ANC decreased because the contribution of dilute surface runoff and lateral flow through the shallow acidic soil horizons to total flow increased. Basins having relatively high ground-water contributions to total flow, in general, have large deposits of thick till or stratified drift. A major factor controlling the sensitivity of these streams and lakes to acidification is the relative contribution of ground water to total discharge.
1468865| The formation of organic sulfur from inorganic sulfate was investigated in hardwood forest floor and mineral horizons. All samples converted sulfate-sulfur into a non-salt extractable form which was recoverable only under conditions which release organic matter. This conversion was inhibited by azide, and depending upon the horizon, by erythromycin, candicidin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. The form of sulfur generated in the O2 forest floor layer and in Al-horizon soil was characterized after isolation by pyrophosphate extraction at pH 8. The organosulfur extracts exhibited an average C:N:S ratio of 103:6:1. The ester sulfate content of the O2 extract was 61% by hydriodic acid (HI) reduction and 62% by hydrolysis in 3N HCl at 121 C. However, compared to hydrolysis, reduction yielded lower estimates of ester sulfate for two of the three soil extracts analyzed. In view of the electrophoretic heterogeneity of all extracts, it is suggested that some may contain stable ester linkages that hydrolyze only after prolonged treatment and that the standard procedure for HI-reduction may provide conditions of temperature and contact time with the acid which are insufficient for the release of sulfate from these esters. 
20519823|Anthropogenic actions are altering fluxes of nitrogen (N) in the biosphere at unprecedented rates. Efforts to study these impacts have concentrated in the Northern hemisphere, where experimental data are available. In tropical developing countries, however, experimental studies are lacking. This paper summarizes available data and assesses the impacts of human activities on N fluxes in Puerto Rico, a densely populated Caribbean island that has experienced drastic landscape transformations over the last century associated with rapid socioeconomic changes. N yield calculations conducted in several watersheds of different anthropogenic influences revealed that disturbed watersheds export more N per unit area than undisturbed forested watersheds. Export of N from urban watersheds ranged from 4.8 kg ha year in the Ro Bayamn watershed to 32.9 kg ha year in the highly urbanized Ro Piedras watershed and 33.3 kg ha year in the rural-agricultural Ro Grande de Aasco watershed. Along with land use, mean annual runoff explained most of the variance in fluvial N yield. Wastewater generated in the San Juan Metropolitan Area receives primary treatment before it is discharged into the Atlantic Ocean. These discharges are N-rich and export large amounts of N to the ocean at a rate of about 140 kg ha year. Data on wet deposition of inorganic N
1469411| Weatherable minerals in all podzol surface soils and shallow granitic rock under European coniferous forests studied hitherto are criss-crossed by numerous open, tubular pores, 3-10 m in width. We hypothesize that these pores were formed by complex-forming, low-molecular weight organic acids exuded by or formed in association with mycorrhizal fungi. It is well known that ectomycorrhizal mycelium represents a greatly extended, and better distributed, surface area for the absorption of nutrients. However, there have been few investigations of how the whereabouts of individual hypha affect nutrient uptake. The results presented here provide direct evidence that the mycelium is able to penetrate, and most probably create, microsites which are inaccessible to plant roots and isolated from bulk soil solution phenomena. Dissolved products could be translocated to the host plant roots, bypassing the soil solution with often toxic concentration of Al<sup>3+</sup> from acid rain, and bypassing competition for nutrient uptake by other organisms. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that "rock-eating" mycorrhizal fungi play a role in the formation of podzol E horizons. The partly speculative interpretations presented here challenge conventional ideas about (1) the importance of nutrient uptake from the bulk soil solution (2) criteria for critical loads of acid atmospheric deposition for forests, and (3) the process of podzolization. 
20456437|Analysis of new data and reinterpretation of published information for clay minerals found in temperate climate soil profiles indicates that there is often a gradient of "illite-like" clay minerals with depth. We used the term "illite-like" because these observations are based on X-Ray Diffractogram patterns and not on layer charge measurements which allow to define properly illite. It appears that "illite-like" layers are concentrated in the upper, organic - rich portion of the soil profile both under grassland and forest vegetation. "Illite-like" layer quantity seems directly related to soil potassium status. Indeed, intensive agriculture practises without potassium fertilization reduce "illite-like" content in surface soils, whereas several years of potassic fertilization without plant growth can increase "illite-like" content. The potassic soil clay mineral, illite, is particularly important in that it can be the major source of readily available potassium for plants. Spatial and temporal dynamics of clay minerals should be related to the potassium cycle. We propose that the frequently observed general trend of increasing exchangeable potassium in the top soil can be correlated with an increase in "illite-like" in the clays and that the decrease of potassium caused by intensive agricultural practices leads to "illite-like" layer destabilization. This vision of "illite-like" layer as a potassium reservoir refueled by plants and emptied by intensive cropping renews the concept of potassium availability and indicates a need to be discussed as well in natural ecosystems as in cultivated ecosystems.
23359749|Soil heterotrophic respiration fluxes at field scale may exhibit a substantial spatial variability. The aim of this study was (1) to elucidate the role of soil temperature and different carbon fractions on heterotrophic soil respiration and (2) to test by which of three different statistical approaches (multiple regression, external drift kriging and simulated annealing) such influences may be best represented. Chamber-based measurements of respiration fluxes were carried out within a 180  40 m bare soil plot. Soil temperature was measured simultaneously to the flux measurements. Further, we recorded total soil organic carbon content, apparent electrical conductivity as well as mid-infrared spectroscopy-based carbon fractions as co-variates in addition to basic soil properties like stone content and texture. A stepwise multiple linear regression procedure was used to spatially predict bare soil respiration from the co-variates. The results showed that the particulate organic matter (POM) fraction and terrain elevation were able to explain the spatial pattern of heterotrophic soil respiration (R 2 = 0.45). In a second step we applied external drift kriging to determine the improvement of using co-variates in an estimation procedure in comparison to ordinary kriging. The maximum relative improvement using the co-variates in terms of the root mean square error was 16%. In a third step we applied simulated annealing to perform stochastic simulations conditioned with external drift kriging to generate more realistic spatial patterns of heterotrophic respiration at plot scale. The conditional stochastic simulations revealed a significantly improved reproduction of the probability density function, the G-statistics value increased from 0.36 to 0.92. Further, the error in the reproduction of the semivariogram of the original point data decreased by more than one order of magnitude. All this confirmed that the mapping of soil respiration patterns may be significantly improved when considering terrain elevation and spatial heterogeneity of POM in combination with a conditional stochastic simulation.
1469881| The direct discharge of groundwater into the coastal zone has received increased attention in the last few years as it is now recognized that this process represents an important pathway for material transport. Assessing these material fluxes is difficult, as there is no simple means to gauge the water flux. We estimated the changing flux of groundwater discharge into a coastal area in the northeast Gulf of Mexico (Florida) based on continuous measurements of radon concentrations over a several day period. Changing radon inventories were converted to fluxes after accounting for losses due to atmospheric evasion and mixing. Radon fluxes are then converted to groundwater inflow rates by estimating the radon concentration of the fluids discharging into the study domain. Groundwater flow was also assessed via seepage meters, radium isotopes, and modeling during this period as part of an "intercomparison" study. The radon results suggest that the flow is: (1) highly variable with flows ranging from 5 to 50 cm/day; and (2) strongly influenced by the tides, with spikes in the flow every 12 hours. The discharge estimates and pattern of flow derived from the radon model matches the automated seepage meter records very closely. 
1469206|For confidently estimating the amount of carbon stored in boreal forest soil, better knowledge of smaller regions is needed. In order to estimate the amount of soil C in forests on mineral soil in Finland, i.e. excluding peatland forests, and illustrate the regional patterns of the storage, statistical models were first made for the C densities of the organic and 0-1 m mineral soil layers. A forest type, which indicated site productivity, and the effective temperature sum were used as explanatory variables of the models. In addition, a constant C density was applied for the soil layer below the depth of 1 m on sorted sediments. Using these models the C densities were calculated for a total of 46673 sites of the National Forest Inventory (NFI). The amount of the soil C was then calculated in two ways: 1) weighting the C densities of the NFI sites by the land area represented by these sites and 2) interpolating the C densities of the NFI sites for 4 ha blocks to cover the whole land area of Finland and summing up the blocks on forested mineral soil. The soil C storage totalled 1109 Tg and 1315 Tg, when calculated by the areal weighting and the interpolated blocks, respectively. Of that storage, 28% was in the organic layer, 68% in the 0-1 m mineral soil layer and 4% in the layer below 1 m. The total soil C equals more than two times the amount of C in tree biomass and 20% of the amount of C in peat in Finland. Soil C maps made using the interpolated blocks indicated that the largest soil C reserves are located in central parts of southern Finland. The C storage of the organic layer was assessed to be overestimated at largest by 13% and that of the 0-1 m mineral soil layer by 29%. The largest error in the organic layer estimate is associated with the effects of forest harvesting and in the mineral soil estimate with the stone content of the soil.
1469787| We tested the hypothesis that the diurnal patterns of variation in lacunal gas concentrations and isotopic fractionation previously reported in a single plant genera (Typha) typified the patterns of all through-flow convective plants by extending our observations to Phragmites australis Cav. In daylight, Phragmites CH<sub>4</sub> transport is driven by internal pressurization which results in gas flow down young green culms and its exit from one year old dead brown culms. Flow rates of 10.4  4.0 mL min<sup>-1</sup> were measured in this study. At night, CH<sub>4</sub> is transported from the sediments to the atmosphere via the lacunal plant spaces by molecular diffusion. Within green culms, lacunal CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations varied by a factor of 1000, from 3% (parts by volume) pre-dawn to lows of 25 ppmv during midday. Methane in brown culms varied by a factor of 10 diurnally, from 5% pre-dawn to 0.3% at midday. Lacunal CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations varied similarly. Concentrations of both gases varied inversely with lacunal pressure. In green culms, large isotopic fractionations were observed in CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> in the morning and evening during transitions in gas transport mode and were associated with slight downward flows counter to the upward diffusion of these gases. Methane  <sup>13</sup>C as depleted as -100 was observed. In daylight, lacunal CH<sub>4</sub> was similar to or <sup>13</sup>C depleted relative to sedimentary and emitted CH<sub>4</sub> isotopic values, but at night lacunal CH<sub>4</sub> was <sup>13</sup>C enriched relative to sedimentary methane. Overall, the diurnal variations of CH<sub>4</sub> concentration and  <sup>13</sup>C value in Phragmites were similar to those observed in Typha and indicate that these patterns should be consistent in other convective-flow plants. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the large isotopic fractionations found in aquatic plants can result solely from isotopic fractionation associated with gas transport. 
40800601|Free amino acids (FAA) constitute a significant fraction of dissolved organic nitrogen (N) in forest soils and play an important role in the N cycle of these ecosystems. However, comparatively little attention has been given to their role as labile carbon (C) substrates that might influence the metabolic status of resident microbial populations. We hypothesized that the residence time of simple C substrates, such as FAA, are mechanistically linked to the turnover of endogenous soil C pools. We tested this hypothesis across a latitudinal gradient of forested ecosystems that differ sharply with regard to climate, overstory taxon, and edaphic properties. Using a combined laboratory and field approach, we compared the turnover of isotopically labeled glycine in situ to the turnover of mineralizable soil C (C min ) at each site. The turnover of glycine was rapid (residence times < 2 h) regardless of soil type. However, across all ecosystems glycine turnover rates were strongly correlated with indices of soil organic matter quality. For example, C:N ratios for the upper soil horizons explained ~ 80% of the variability observed in glycine turnover, and there was a strong positive correlation between in situ glycine-C turnover and C min measured in the laboratory. The turnover of glycine in situ was better explained by changes in soil C availability than cross-ecosystem variation in soil temperature or concentrations of dissolved inorganic N and FAA-N. This suggests the consumption of these low-molecular-weight substrates by soil microorganisms may be governed as much by the overall decomposability of soil C as by N limitation to microbial growth.
1469140|The partitioning of nitrogen deposition among soil, litter, below- and above-ground biomass of trees and understory vegetation was investigated in a 15-year-old Picea abies (L.) Karst. plantation in the Fichtelgebirge, Germany, by labeling with 62 mg of <sup>15</sup>N tracer per square meter in March 1991. Ammonium and nitrate depositions were simulated on five plots each, by labeling with either <sup>15</sup>N-NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or <sup>15</sup>N-NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and the <sup>15</sup>N pulse was followed during two successive growing seasons (1991 and 1992). Total recovery rates of the <sup>15</sup>N tracer in the entire stand ranged between 93 and 102% for both nitrogen forms in 1991, and 82% in June 1992.  <sup>15</sup>N ratios increased rapidly in all compartments of the ecosystem. Roots and soils (to 65 cm depth) showed significant <sup>15</sup>N enrichments for both <sup>15</sup>N-treatments compared to reference plots. Newly grown spruce tissues were more enriched than older ones, but the most enriched  <sup>15</sup>N values were found in the understory vegetation. Although spruce trees were a much larger pool (1860 g biomass/m<sup>2</sup>) than understory vegetation (Vaccinium myrtillus 333 g/m<sup>2</sup>, Calluna vulgaris 142 g/m<sup>2</sup>, Deschampsia flexuosa 22 g/m<sup>2</sup>), the ericaceous shrubs and the perennial grass were a much greater sink for the <sup>15</sup>N label. Eight months after labeling, 9% of the ammonium and 15% of the nitrate label were found in the understory. P.abies retained only 3% of the <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium and 7% of the <sup>15</sup>N-nitrate. The main sink for both <sup>15</sup>N tracers was the soil, where 87% of the ammonium and 79% of the nitrate tracer were found. The organic soil horizon (5-0 cm depth) contained 63% of the <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium and 46% of the <sup>15</sup>N-nitrate suggesting strong immobilization by microorganisms of both N forms. Eight months after tracer application, about 16% of both <sup>15</sup>N-tracers was found below 25 cm soil depth. This 16% corresponds well to a 20% decrease in the recovery of both <sup>15</sup>N tracers after 15 months and indicates a total loss out of the ecosystem. Highly enriched  <sup>15</sup>N values were found in fruit bodies of fungi growing in reference plots (no <sup>15</sup>N addition), although soils did not show increased  <sup>15</sup>N ratios. No transfer of <sup>15</sup>N-tracer between fungi and spruce or understory vegetation was apparent yet.
1469192| Benthic sulfate reduction and sediment pools of sulfur and iron were examined during January 1992 at 3 stations in the Ao Nam Bor mangrove, Phuket, Thailand. Patterns of sulfate reduction rates (0-53 cm) reflected differences in physical and biological conditions at the 3 stations, and highest rates were found at the vegetated site within the mangrove (Rhizophora apiculata) forest. Due to extended oxidation of mangrove sediments, a large portion of the added <sup>35</sup>S-label was recovered in the chromium reducible pools (FeS<sub>2</sub> and S<sup>0</sup>) (41-91% of the reduced sulfur). Pyrite was the most important inorganic sulfur component, attaining pool sizes 50-100 times higher than acid volatile pools (FeS). HCl-extractable (0.5 M HCl) iron pools, including Fe(II)<sub>HCl</sub> and Fe(III)<sub>Hcl</sub>, were generally low and Fe(III)<sub>HCl</sub> was only present in the upper surface layers (0-5 cm). Maximum concentrations of dissolved Fe<sup>2+</sup> (35-285 M) occurred just about the depth where dissolved  H<sub>2</sub>S accumulated. Furthermore Fe<sup>2+</sup> and  H<sub>2</sub>S coexisted only where concentrations of both were low. There was an accumulation of organic sulfur in the deep sediment at 2 stations in the inner part of the mangrove. The reoxidation of reduced sulfides was rapid, and storage of sulfur was minor in the upper sediment layers, where factors like bioturbation, the presence of roots, or tidal mixing enhance oxidation processes. 
24715145|To study the long-term fate of deposited ammonium (NH) in a Scots pine forest stand under high nitrogen (N) deposition in the Netherlands we re-sampled the plots of a N tracer experiment with high (i.e. ambient) and lowered N deposition in this stand 8 years after application of the tracer. The results were compared with results obtained 7 years earlier. In the 7 years between the samplings the N deltas of needles, twigs and upper organic soil layer had converged to similar values still above the natural N abundance, suggesting equilibration as a result of intensive cycling of N among these pools. Bark and wood had lower deltas than needles and twigs, but if the label found was attributed to tissue synthesized since the start of the labeling only, bark values were similar to needles and twigs, whereas wood values were higher indicating retranslocation of N into older wood. Mineral soil lost all N label it had accumulated after 1 year indicating that this label had not been strongly bound. The first year the low N treatment had retained more of the labeled NH deposition than the high N treatment, but in the seven subsequent years relatively more label was retained in the latter. This better retention after 7 years was ascribed to a larger fraction of label taken up by the vegetation in the high N treatment. This shows that the vegetation can affect the label dynamics despite the fact that only a relatively small amount of label was present in the aboveground vegetation.
41410573|The environmental impact of different forest harvesting scenarios on soil nutrient status and water chemistry under current and future (IPCC A2) climate was evaluated for a random sample of lake catchments (n = 1066) covering Finland. Biomass removal scenarios were derived from a managementoriented large-scale forest model based on data from national forest inventories. Forest ecosystem sustainability was assessed by evaluating soil base cation balances as well as temporal changes (2010-2050) in soil base saturation and lake water acid neutralising capacity, using a dynamic hydro-geochemical model. The harvesting scenarios had very different effects on biomass and element removal as well as soil and water quality; only harvesting of above-ground woody biomass (stem-only or stem-and-branches harvesting scenarios) was predicted to be sustainable, i.e. not depleting the soil base cation pools in the long term. The most intensive scenariowhole-tree harvesting (including the removal of stumps and roots)doubled the removal of biomass, tripled the removal of base cations from the catchment soils, and increased nitrogen removal fourfold. Climate change was predicted to have a positive impact by increasing the future supply of base cations from weathering, thus compensating their removal by biomass harvesting. However, additional inputs of nitrogen and potassium will be required to ensure sustained forest growth under intensive biomass harvesting. scenarios) was predicted to be sustainable, i.e. not depleting the soil base cation pools in the long term.

25652596|Soil mono- and disaccharides (SS) and total free amino acids (AA) can influence soil microbial activities, whether they are derived from decomposition of organic materials or from plant root exudates. To quantify the relative importance of aboveground plant litter input and belowground inputs of root exudates and root debris on SS and AA, we conducted litter removal, root trenching and tree girdling experiments in a subtropical moist forest of southwest China. We found that concentrations of SS and AA had pronounced seasonal fluctuations. Litter removal markedly reduced SS concentrations, but it had no effect on AA concentrations. Concentrations of SS were significantly correlated with litterfall that had occurred 2 months earlier in the control plots, but that correlation was not observed in the litter removal plots. Multiple-linear regressions of soil respiration and soil temperature on AA concentrations were significant in both control and litter removal plots, but not in the root trenching or tree girdling plots. These results suggest that SS levels are likely to be regulated by aboveground plant litter input, and concentrations of AA are affected by microbial activity that fluctuates with soil temperature and belowground carbon input.
41410563|The effects of the heat and drought of the summer 2003 on carbon (C) fluxes (soil CO efflux, dissolved organic carbon in soil, C from litterfall and C sequestration in tree) were investigated in three mature forests in Switzerland between 2001 and 2005. Measurements of the soil matric potential () indicated a gradient in drought intensity at the three sites (Vordemwald, Schanis, Beatenberg) with average  during the summer 2003 of -75, -41 and -5 kPa, respectively. In Vordemwald where the drought was the most severe, the hourly soil CO efflux declined by about 30% when  < -90 kPa. Estimated annual soil CO efflux in 2003 was about 10% smaller than effluxes in wetter years (2001, 2002 and 2004) but the differences were not significant. In Schanis and Beatenberg, no suppression of hourly soil CO efflux was observed during the summer 2003. The annual efflux in 2003 at both sites was 10-15% larger than the effluxes in the other years but the differences were not significant. DOC concentrations increased during the first rewetting events after the drought in Vordemwald and in Schanis. This was mainly due to a concentration effect due to the low soil water content. Because precipitation was lower in 2003, annual DOC fluxes substantially decreased at the three sites. Carbon sequestration in tree stems in Vordemwald declined by 32% in 2003 compared to the mean 2002-2005. In Beatenberg and Schanis, tree growth responded little to the extreme summer 2003. Litterfall at the three sites showed no marked reaction to the summer 2003. Estimate of annual net ecosystem production (NEP) suggested that the stands in Vordemwald and in Schanis remained a C sink between 2002 and 2005 but that the extreme summer 2003 caused a decrease in NEP. In Beatenberg, the impact on the NEP seemed to be limited in 2003. The annual NEP in 2003 decreased with increasing drought intensity over the three sites. the drought in Vordemwald and in Schanis.

40343576|The macrotidal estuary of Penz (Brittany, Western part of the Channel, France) has been subjected to recurrent annual toxic blooms of Alexandrium minutum since 1988. This study aims to specify the phosphorus dynamics and bioavailability in sediments in order to improve our understanding of Alexandrium occurrences. Sediment-P pools and diffusive phosphate fluxes were studied under similar hydrodynamic conditions, in the intermediate estuary in May, June and July 2003 and along the salinity gradient from August 2004 to June 2005. The results highlight a decrease in bioavailable phosphorus (iron and organic bound) from the inner part of the estuary seaward. The ratio of iron-bound phosphorus to ironoxyhydroxides is lower in the inner and intermediate estuaries (5-8) than in the outer site (15), suggesting a saturation of sorption sites and greater phosphorus bioavailability in this area. Pools of bioavailable phosphorus in surficial sediments are about eight times higher than the annual net-export of P (7 ton year). Phosphate releases from sediments are always lower than 5 mol m d in March. The highest supplies occur in June and August in the intermediate area (up to 400 mol m d) where they represent up to 50% of river loadings. These results further suggest that phosphate pulses coincide with occurrences of Alexandrium reported in June.
1469536| Soil organic carbon (SOC) was partitioned between unprotected and protected pools in six forests along an elevation gradient in the southern Appalachian Mountains using two physical methods: flotation in aqueous CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1.4 g/mL) and wet sieving through a 0.053 mm sieve. Both methods produced results that were qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Along the elevation gradient, 28 to 53% of the SOC was associated with an unprotected pool that included forest floor O-layers and other labile soil organic matter (SOM) in various stages of decomposition. Most (71 to 83%) of the C in the mineral soil at the six forest sites was identified as protected because of its association with a heavy soil fraction (> 1.4 g/mL) or a silt-clay soil fraction. Total inventories of SOC in the forests (to a depth of 30 cm) ranged from 384 to 1244 mg C/cm<sup>2</sup>. The turnover time of the unprotected SOC was negatively correlated (r = -0.95, p < 0.05) with mean annual air temperature (MAT) across the elevation gradient. Measured SOC inventories, annual C returns to the forest floor, and estimates of C turnover associated with the protected soil pool were used to parameterize a simple model of SOC dynamics. Steady-state predictions with the model indicated that, with no change in C inputs, the low- (235-335 m), mid- (940-1000 m), and high- (1650-1670 m) elevation forests under study might surrender  40 to 45% of their current SOC inventory following a 4 C increase in MAT. Substantial losses of unprotected SOM as a result of a warmer climate could have longterm impacts on hydrology, soil quality, and plant nutrition in forest ecosystems throughout the southern Appalachian Mountains. 
1469661|The contribution of deep tree roots to the nutrition of a tropical rainforest were studied along an edaphic transect in French Guyana. Soil types were mapped in relation to the texture of the upper horizons and the depth of occurrence of the loamy saprolite. The position of mature individuals of four common species, differing by they rooting depth, was identified and tree leaves were analysed for major nutrients and strontium (Sr) isotopic ratios. On average, the range of leaf isotopic ratio (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr = 0.714-0.716) was narrow compared to that of bulk soils (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr = 0.72-0.77). Steep gradients of increasing <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr in roots with soil depth were found in all investigated profiles, which indicated that the flux of Sr deposited in rain and leached from the litter layer was tightly retained in the upper soil layers. Over the whole of the site, as well as within each soil unit, tree <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios were very similar whatever the species, and close to litter and near-surface roots <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios, suggesting no or very little Sr contribution from deep tree roots. Variations of Ca and Sr concentrations in leaves were strongly correlated but not with leaf <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios. These results support the theory that Sr and Ca uptake and cycling are mostly superficial in tropical rainforests.
1468613|Salps, salp fecal pellets and other zooplankton species were analyzed for a suite of elements and natural radionuclides to assess their role in the biogeochemical cycling of nuclides in oceanic waters. The nuclide/Al ratios in organisms normalized to the same ratio in crustal rock indicated that Ca, Sr, Zn, Cu, U, <sup>210</sup>Po, and <sup>210</sup>Pb are enriched in the organisms. The concentrations of Fe, Al, Th isotopes and <sup>210</sup>Pb in salps and fecal pellets were about an order of magnitude higher than those in salps, whereas Ca, Cu, Zn, Mn and Po were higher by factors of about 2-5. Fluxes via salp defecation were higher than those which have been measured in crustacean zooplankton species, a result primarily due to the high defecation rates characteristic of salps. High nuclide levels in salp fecal pellets coupled with high defecation rates and presumed high salp biomass in many areas underscore the importance of these indiscriminate filter feeders in packaging and transporting to depth particulate-associated nuclides in surface waters.
25652594|The contribution of soil microbial residues to stable carbon pools may be of particular importance in the tropics where carbon residence times are short and any available carbon is rapidly utilized. In this study we investigated the vertical distribution of microbially-derived amino sugars in two tropical forests on contrasting meta-sedimentary and serpentinite parent materials in the lowlands of Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. Despite their similar climate, vegetative cover, and general microbial community structure, the two soils were chemically and physically distinct. We found that both parent material and depth significantly influenced the pool sizes of microbial residues in the two soils. In particular, the soil derived from sedimentary parent material had greater amino sugar contents, glucosamine to galactosamine ratios, and percentage of total soil carbon that is amino sugar derived, than the soil derived from serpentinite substrate. We speculate that residue stabilization was linked to soil iron oxide content, with significant difference in amino sugars contribution to total soil carbon at depth in the serpentinite-derived soil versus that derived from sedimentary parent material. Based on observed patterns of amino sugar content and relative abundance we suggest that near the surface of both soils vegetation and litter input determines the composition and quantity of microbial residues. With increasing depth the influence of vegetation declines and production and stabilization of microbial amino sugars becomes driven by soil matrix characteristics. These differences in stabilization mechanism and carbon dynamics with depth may be particularly critical in deep weathered tropical soils.
1468928|The isotopic composition of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in bulk precipitation, canopy throughfall, seepage water at three different soil depths, stream water, and groundwater was monitored in two forested catchments in the Black Forest (Germany) between November 1989 and February 1992. Isotope measurements on aqueous sulfate were complemented by  <sup>34</sup>S-analyses on SO<sub>2</sub> in the air, total sulfur and inorganic sulfate in the soil, and bedrock sulfur, in order to identify sources and biogeochemical processes affecting S cycling in catchments with base poor, siliceous bedrock. Stable S isotope data indicated that atmospheric deposition and not mineral weathering is the major source of S in both catchments since  <sup>34</sup>S-values for sulfate in the soil, in seepage water, and in stream water were generally found to be similar to the mean  <sup>34</sup>S-values of precipitation SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> (+2.1%). However,  <sup>18</sup>O-values of seepage water SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> at 30 cm and especially at 80 cm depth were depleted by several per mil with respect to those of the atmospheric deposition (+7.5 to +13.5%). This indicates that in both catchments a considerable proportion of the seepage water SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is derived from mineralization of carbon-bonded soil S and must therefore have cycled through the organic soil S pool.  <sup>34</sup>S-values for different S compounds in the solid soil were found to differ markedly depending on S fraction and soil depth. Since atmospheric S deposition with rather constant  <sup>34</sup>S-values was identified as the dominant S source in both catchments, this is interpreted as a result of in situ isotope fractionation rather than admixture of isotopically different S. The differences between the  <sup>34</sup>S-values of seepage water and soil sulfate and those of organic soil S compounds are consistent with a model in which SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> uptake by vegetation and soil microorganisms favours <sup>34</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> slightly, whereas during mineralization of organic soil S to aqueous SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, <sup>32</sup>S reacts preferentially. However, the data provide evidence for negligible isotope fractionation during physico-chemical S transformations such as adsorption/desorption in aerated forest soils.
41490412|The "critical zone" includes the coupled earth surface systems of vegetation, regolith and groundwater that are essential to sustaining life on the planet. The function of this zone is the result of complex interactions among physical, chemical and biological processes and understanding these interactions remains a major challenge to earth system sciences. Here we develop an integrated framework based on thermodynamic theory to characterize the critical zone as a system open to energy and mass fluxes that are forced by radiant, geochemical, and elevational gradients. We derive a statement that demonstrates the relative importance of solar radiation, water, carbon, and physical/chemical denudation mass fluxes to the critical zone energy balance. Within this framework we use rates of effective energy and mass transfer [EEMT; W m-] to quantify the relevant flux-gradient relations. Synthesis of existing data demonstrates that variation in energetics associated with primary production and effective precipitation explains substantial variance in critical zone structure and function. Furthermore, we observe threshold behavior in systems that transition to primary production predominance of the energy flux term. The proposed framework provides a first order approximation of non-linearity in critical zone processes that may be coupled with physical and numerical models to constrain landscape evolution.
1468830| Millions of hectares of tropical forest are cleared annually for agriculture, pasture, shifting cultivation and timber. One result of these changes in land use is the release of CO<sub>2</sub> from the cleared vegetation and soils. Although there is uncertainty as to the size of this release, it appears to be a major source of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, second only to the release from the combustion of fossil fuels. This study estimates the release of CO<sub>2</sub> from tropical soils using a computer model that simulates land use change in the tropics and data on (1) the carbon content of forest soils before clearing; (2) the changes in the carbon content under the various types of land use; and (3) the area of forest converted to each use. It appears that the clearing and use of tropical soils affects their carbon content to a depth of about 40 cm. Soils of tropical closed forests contain approximately 6.7 kg C  m<sup>-2</sup>; soils of tropical open forests contain approximately 5.2 kg C  m<sup>-2</sup> to this depth. The cultivation of tropical soils reduces their carbon content by 40% 5 yr after clearing; the use of these soils for pasture reduces it by about 20%. Logging in tropical forests appears to have little effect on soil carbon. The carbon content of soils used by shifting cultivators returns to the level found under primary forest about 35 yr after abandonment. The estimated net release of carbon from tropical soils due to land use change was 0.11-0.26  10<sup>15</sup> g in 1980. 
40647939|This study evaluated the sources, sinks, and factors controlling net export of nitrogen (N) from watersheds on the west coast of the US. We calculated input of new N to 22 watersheds for 1992 and 2002. 1992 inputs ranged from 541 to 11,644 kg N km year, with an overall area-weighted average of 1,870 kg N km year. In 2002, the range of inputs was 490-10,875 kg N km year averaging 2,158 kg N km year. Fertilizer was the most important source of new N, averaging 956 (1992) and 1,073 kg N km year (2002). Atmospheric deposition was the next most important input, averaging 833 (1992) and 717 kg N km year (2002), followed by biological N fixation in agricultural lands. Riverine N export, calculated based on measurements taken at the furthest downstream USGS water quality monitoring station, averaged 165 (1992) and 196 kg N km year (2002), although data were available for only 7 watersheds at the latter time point. Downstream riverine N export was correlated with variations in streamflow (export = 0.94 x streamflow - 5.65, R = 0.66), with N inputs explaining an additional 16% of the variance (export = 1.06 x streamflow + 0.06 x input - 227.78, R = 0.82). The percentage of N input that is exported averaged 12%. Percent export was also related to streamflow (%export = 0.05 x streamflow - 2.61, R = 0.60). The correlations with streamflow are likely a result of its large dynamic range in these systems. However, the processes that control watershed N export are not yet completely understood.
1468867|At Humingbird Cay, Exuma, Bahamas, distributions of both Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) and Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) are closely correlated with amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) in the soil. R. mangle is primarily distributed within large areas of low to moderate H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations (mean = 40 mg/l). H<sub>2</sub>S levels under A. germinans are lower (mean = 22 mg/l), but the area immediately beyond their root zone often has extremely high sulfide concentrations (mean = 120 mg/l). These results suggest that past attempts to explain mangrove distribution in terms of monotonic soil gradients, the dispersal characteristics of propagules, and interspecific competition are incomplete, and that it will be necessary to examine the link between soil sulfur chemistry and mangrove distribution more fully.
1469565|Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from soils, representing the consequence of CH<sub>4</sub> production, CH<sub>4</sub> consumption and CH<sub>4</sub> transport, are poorly characterised and show a large spatial variability. This study aimed to assess the determinants of field-scale spatial variability of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from wet grasslands on peat soil. Mean CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates of a three-year experiment at 18 plots distributed over three sites in the nature preserve "Nieuwkoopse Plassen" on peat soil in the Netherlands were related to CH<sub>4</sub> production and CH<sub>4</sub> consumption capacities of soil layers, and to soil and vegetation characteristics. Spatial variability of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions and possible determining factors was high. Annual CH<sub>4</sub> emissions ranged from 3 to 37 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Coefficients of variation (CV) of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were on average 37% among sites and 83% within sites. Most important determinants of spatial variability were CH<sub>4</sub> production capacity (average: 211 ng CH<sub>4</sub> g<sup>-1</sup> dry soil h<sup>-1</sup>; CV: 131%) and aboveground biomass of sedges (Carex spp.) (average: 0.45 g dm<sup>-2</sup>; CV: 127%) (P < 0.01). Sedges may affect CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by stimulating CH<sub>4</sub> transport from anaerobic layers to the surface via their vascular system and/or by serving as substrate for methanogens. For extrapolation of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions to larger areas, best results will be obtained by using factors that are easy to determine, like vegetation.
25652593|The landscapes colonized by invasive earthworms in the eastern U.S. are often patchworks of forest stands in various stages of successional development. We established six field sites in tulip poplar dominated forests in the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, MD, that span mid (5070 years-three plots) and late (120150 years-three plots) successional stages where younger sites had greater earthworm density and biomass than older sites and were dominated by nonnative lumbricid species. In particular Lumbricus rubellus, a litter-feeding species, was abundant in mid successional forests. Here, we separated particulate organic matter (POM) from the bulk soil by a combination of size and density fractionation and found that patterns in soil POM chemistry were similar to those found previously during litter decay: in younger forests with high abundance of earthworms, organic carbon normalized cutin- and suberin-derived substituted fatty acid (SFA) concentration was lower and lignin-derived phenols greater than in older forests where earthworms were less abundant. The chemistry of the dominant litter from mid versus late successional tree species did not fully explain the differences in POM chemistry between age classes. Instead, the differences in leaf body versus petiole and leaf versus root chemistry were the dominant drivers of POM chemistry in mid versus late successional stands, although aspects of stand age and tree species also impacted POM chemistry. Our results indicate that preferential ingestion of leaf body tissue by earthworms and the subsequent shifts in sources of plant biopolymers in soil influenced POM chemistry in mid successional forests. These results indicate that invasive earthworm activity in North American forests contributes to a shift in the aromatic and aliphatic composition of POM and thus potentially influences carbon stabilization in soil.
1469835|The effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on nutrient cycling and selected belowground processes in the closed-canopy sweetgum plantation were assessed as part of a free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment (FACE) experiment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. We hypothesized that nitrogen (N) constraints to growth response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> would be mitigated primarily by reduced tissue concentrations (resulting in increased biomass production per unit uptake) rather than increased uptake. Conversely, we hypothesized that the constraints of other nutrients to growth response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> would be mitigated primarily by increased uptake because of adequate soil supplies. The first hypothesis was not supported: although elevated CO<sub>2</sub> caused reduced foliar N concentrations, it also resulted in increased uptake and requirement of N, primarily because of greater root turnover. The additional N uptake with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> constituted between 10 and 40% of the estimated soil mineralizeable N pool. The second hypothesis was largely supported: elevated CO<sub>2</sub> had no significant effects on tissue concentrations of P, K, Ca, or Mg and caused significantly increased uptake and requirement of K, Ca, and Mg. Soil exchangeable pools of these nutrients are large and should pose no constraint to continued growth responses. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> also caused increased microbial biomass, reduced N leaching and increased P leaching from O horizons (measured by resin lysimeters), reduced soil solution NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and increased soil solution pH. There were no statistically significant treatment effects on soil nutrient availability as measured by resin capsules, resin stakes, or in situ incubations. Despite significantly lower litterfall N concentrations in the elevated CO<sub>2</sub> treatment, there were no significant treatment effects on translocation or forest floor biomass or nutrient contents. There were also no significant treatment effects on the rate of decomposition of fine roots. In general, the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on nutrient cycling in this study were not large; future constraints on growth responses imposed by N limitations will depend on changes in N demand, atmospheric N deposition, and soil mineralization rates.
25652591|The bioavailability and composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) were examined in 10 major sub-catchments of the Swan-Canning estuary, which bisects the city of Perth, in south-western Australia. Catchments contain a mix of forest, agriculture, and urban-dominated land-use, with the degree of development increasing near the city center. We incubated water samples from the 10 sub-catchments for 14 days at 25C, and measured changes in DOC and DON and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). A greater proportion of DON (444%) was decomposed compared to DOC (117%). Both agricultural and urban catchments had high proportions of bioavailable DOC and DON, but overall DOC and DON losses were greatest in urban catchments. Using resin isolation techniques, we found that DOC was concentrated in the hydrophobic (humic) fraction, whereas DON had both hydrophobic and hydrophilic (non-humic) fractions. Hydrophobic DOC content was positively related to DOC decomposition. In contrast, DON decomposition was highly correlated with hydrophilic DON content and inversely related to the hydrophilic DOC/DON ratio, indicating a labile fraction of DON from non-humic sources. Taken together, these relationships suggest that bioavailable DOC may be supplied in part from terrestrial plant material, but bioavailable DON is likely to be from highly labile sources, possibly autochthonous or anthropogenic. Overall, labile DON was greater than initial DIN concentration at seven of ten sites and was even dominant in highly developed catchments. This study highlights the importance of organic N in urbanizing coastal catchments that, in addition to DIN, may serve as a readily available source of N for in-stream and estuarine production.
1468570|A lower limit for nitrogen loss from desert ecosystems in the southwestern United States was estimated by comparing nitrogen inputs to the amount of nitrogen stored in desert soils and vegetation. Atmospheric input of nitrogen for the last 10 000 years was conservatively estimated to be 2.99 kg N/m<sup>2</sup>. The amount of nitrogen stored in desert soils was calculated to be 0.604 kg N/m<sup>3</sup> using extant data from 212 profiles located in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. The average amount of nitrogen stored in desert vegetation is approximately 0.036 kg N/m<sup>2</sup>. Desert conditions have existed in the southwestern United States throughout the last 10 000 years. Under such conditions, vertical leaching of nitrogen below a depth of 1 m is small (ca. 0.028 kg N/m<sup>2</sup> over 10 000 years) and streamflow losses of nitrogen from the desert landscape are negligible. Thus, the discrepancy found between nitrogen input and storage represents the amount of nitrogen lost to the atmosphere during the last 10 000 years. Loss of nitrogen to the atmosphere was calculated to be 2.32 kg N/m<sup>2</sup>, which is 77% of the atmospheric inputs. Processes resulting in nitrogen loss to the atmosphere from desert ecosystems include wind erosion, ammonia volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. Our analysis cannot assess the relative importance of these processes, but each is worthy of future research efforts.
20055227|Depletion of calcium from forest soils has important implications for forest productivity and health. Ca is available to fine feeder roots from a number of soil organic and mineral sources, but identifying the primary source or changes of sources in response to environmental change is problematic. We used strontium isotope and alkaline earth element concentration ratios of trees and soils to discern the record of Ca sources for red spruce at a base-poor, acid deposition-impacted watershed. We measured
24715335|Earthworm burrow-lining is a biophysical interface where the relationship between the spatial location of active soil microorganisms and the actual physical structure of the soil has a major influence on geochemical processes and nutrient cycling. Isotopic tracers and NanoSIMS were combined to highlight, at the nanometric scale, N and S transfers from earthworms to this non-destructured biophysical interface. Peat mesocosms were inoculated with double labelled earthworms (N and S; Lumbricus rubellus H.) and then sampled for NanoSIMS quantitative measurements. The maximum enrichments of N and S detected in peat after 24 days were 1.6 and 5.6 APE (Atom % excess), respectively. NanoSIMS analyses, performed along a transect in peat at increasing distances from contact between the epidermis of an earthworm and its burrow-lining, revealed rapid and brief transfers of biogenic N and S into peat with two contrasted distributions i.e., decreasing N and patchy S. The sphere of influence of L. rubellus was clearly delimited after 24 days at 1 mm around the burrow, thus specifying the functional traits of this epi-anecic earthworm. The observed N inputs into peat were probably derived from oxidation of the labile products of earthworm metabolism, such as urea and/or ammonium, as shown by the strong linkage of N with oxygen measured as O. The transfers of labile S products from earthworm to the surrounding soil are reported here for the first time and could be derived from mucoprotein secretion. The interesting spatially inverse relationship between N and S enriched-spots at increasing distances from the burrow-lining highlighted different fates of the biogenic N and S compounds excreted by earthworms and could reveal the activities of syntrophic partnerships in N and S cycling. The strategy of combining isotopic tracers with NanoSIMS demonstrated high potential for determining the fate of biogenic nutrient inputs occurring in a complex matrix such as soil. It opens up considerable opportunities to link the biological traits of specific soil engineers with geochemical processes operating at the microbial scale in the spatial structure created by earthworms.
1468782|The impact of hydrology (floods, seepage) on the chemistry of water and sediment in floodplain lakes was studied by a multivariate analysis (PCA) of physico-chemical parameters in 100 lakes within the floodplains in the lower reaches of the rivers Rhine and Meuse. In addition, seasonal fluctuations in water chemistry and chlorophyll-a development in the main channel of the Lower Rhine and five floodplain lakes along a flooding gradient were monitored. The species composition of the summer phytoplankton in these lakes was studied as well. At present very high levels of chloride, sodium, sulphate, phosphate and nitrate are found in the main channels of the rivers Rhine and Meuse, resulting from industrial, agricultural and domestic sewage. Together with the actual concentrations of major ions and nutrients in the main channel, the annual flood duration determines the physico-chemistry of the floodplain lakes. The river water influences the water chemistry of these lakes not only via inundations, but also via seepage. A comparison of recent and historical chemical data shows an increase over the years in the levels of chloride both in the main channel of the Lower Rhine and in seepage lakes along this river. Levels of alkalinity in floodplain lakes showed an inverse relationship with annual flood duration, because sulphur retention and alkalinization occurred in seepage waters and rarely-flooded lakes. The input of large quantities of nutrients (N, P) from the main channel has resulted, especially in frequently flooded lakes, in an increase in algal biomass and a shift in phytoplankton composition from a diatom dominated community towards a community dominated by chlorophytes and cyanobacteria.
1469487|Calcareous fens in Minnesota are spring-seepage peatlands with a distinctive flora of rare calciphilic species. Peat characteristics and groundwater geochemistry were determined for six calcareous fens in the Minnesota River Basin to better understand the physical structure and chemical processes associated with stands of rare vegetation. Onset of peat accumulation in three of the fens ranged from about 4,700 to 11,000 <sup>14</sup>C yrs BP and probably resulted from a combination of climate change and local hydrogeologic conditions. Most peat cores had a carbonate-bearing surface zone with greater than 10% carbonates (average 27%, dry wt basis), an underlying carbonate-depleted zone with 10% or less carbonates (average 4%), and a carbonate-bearing lower zone again with greater than 10% carbonates (average 42%). This carbonate zonation was hypothesized to result from the effect of water-table level on carbonate equilibria: carbonate precipitation occurs when the water table is above a critical level, and carbonate dissolution occurs when the water table is lower. Other processes that changed the major ion concentrations in upwelling groundwater include dilution by rain water, sulfate reduction or sulfide oxidation, and ion adsorption or exchange. Geochemical modeling indicated that average shallow water in the calcareous fens during the study period was groundwater mixed with about 6 to 13% rain water. Carbonate precipitation in the surface zone of calcareous fens could be decreased by a number of human activities, especially those that lower the water table. Such changes in shallow water geochemistry could alter the growing conditions that apparently sustain rare fen vegetation.
20519834|In this study, we use classical and geostatistical methods to identify characteristics of some selected soil properties including soil particle size distribution, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH and electrical conductivity and their spatial variation in a 5-year recovery degraded sandy grassland after two different grazing intensity disturbance: post-heavy-grazing restoration grassland (HGR) and post-moderately grazing restoration grassland (MGR), respectively, in Horqin steppe, Inner Mongolia, northern China. The objective was to examine effect of grazing intensity on spatial heterogeneity of soil properties. One hundred soil samples were taken from the soil layer 0-15 cm in depth of a grid of 10 m  10 m under each treatment. The results showed that soil fine fractions (very fine sand, 0.1-0.05 mm and silt + clay, &lt; 0.05 mm), soil organic carbon and total nitrogen concentrations were significant lower and their coefficients of variation significant higher under the HGR than under the MGR. Geostatistical analysis of soil heterogeneity revealed that soil particle size fractions, organic carbon and total nitrogen showed different degree of spatial dependence with exponential or spherical semivariograms on the scale measured under HGR and MGR. The spatial structured variance account for a large proportion of the sample variance in HGR plot ranging from 88% to 97% for soil particle fractions, organic C and total N, however, except for organic C (88.8%), the structured variance only account for 50% of the sample variance for soil particle fractions and total N in the MGR plot. The ranges of spatial autocor-relation for coarse-fine sand, very fine sand, silt + clay, organic C and total N were 13.7 m, 15.8 m, 15.2 m, 22.2 m and 21.9 m in HGR plot, respectively, and was smaller than in MGR plot with the corresponding distance of 350 m, 144.6 m, 45.7 m, 27.3 m and 30.3 m, respectively. This suggested that overgrazing resulted in an increase in soil heterogeneity. Soil organic C and total N were associated closely with soil particle fractions, and the kriging-interpolated maps showed that the spatial distribution of soil organic C and total N corresponded to the distribution patterns of soil particle fractions, indicating that high degree of spatial heterogeneity in soil properties was linked to the distribution of vegetative and bare sand patches. The results suggested that the degree of soil heterogeneity at field scale can be used as an index for indicating the extent of grassland desertification. Also, the changes in soil heterogeneity may in turn influence vegetative succession and restoration process of degraded sandy grassland ecosystem.
24715088|Producing food, transportation, and energy for seven billion people has led to large and widespread increases in the use of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers and fossil fuel combustion, resulting in a leakage of N into the environment as various forms of air and water pollution. The global N cycle is more severely altered by human activity than the global carbon (C) cycle, and reactive N dynamics affect all aspects of climate change considerations, including mitigation, adaptation, and impacts. In this special issue of Biogeochemistry, we present a review of the climatenitrogen interactions based on a technical report for the United States National Climate Assessment presented as individual papers for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, agriculture and human health within the US. We provide a brief overview of each of the paper's main points and conclusions is presented in this foreword summary.
1468566|A model of boreal forest dynamics was adapted to examine the factors controlling carbon and nitrogen cycling in the boreal forests of interior Alaska. Empirical relationships were used to simulate decomposition and nitrogen availability as a function of either substrate quality, the soil thermal regime, or their interactive effects. Test comparisons included black spruce forests growing on permafrost soils and black spruce, birch, and white spruce forests growing on permafrost-free soils. For each forest, simulated above-ground tree biomass, basal area, density, litterfall, moss biomass, and forest floor mass, turnover, thickness, and nitrogen concentration were compared to observed data. No one decay equation simulated forests entirely consistent with observed data, but over the range of upland forest types in interior Alaska, the equation that combined the effects of litter quality and the soil thermal regime simulated forests that were most consistent with observed data. For black spruce growing on permafrost soils, long-term simulated forest dynamics in the absence of fire resulted in unproductive forests with a thick forest floor and low nitrogen mineralization. Fires were an important means to interrupt this sequence and to restart forest succession.
41410593|The effects of elevated ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on methane dynamics was studied in a natural fen in Northern Finland for three growing seasons (2003-2005). This is the first in situ study on the effects of elevated UV-B radiation on methane dynamics in a natural fen. The experimental setup consisted of 30 study plots (120 x 120 cm) that were randomly divided into three treatments: ambient control, UV-A control and elevated UV-B. The UV-B enhancements were 63, 37 and 21% above ambient during the growing seasons 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Elevated UV-B did not affect net methane emission. Stable isotope composition of methane indicated that methane was produced by the acetate fermentation. Under elevated UV-B there was a slight increase in the concentrations of acetate and propionate but decrease in the oxalate concentration suggesting UV-B-induced changes in the belowground processes. The results emphasize the need for long-term field studies under moderately enhanced exposures to estimate whether the function and feedbacks of mire ecosystems change under increased UV-B radiation.
1469269|Woods Lake, in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, was the site of the Experimental Watershed Liming Study (EWLS) in which base addition was investigated as a method for mitigation of lake acidity. In an effort to predict the duration of effects, the treatment was simulated using the Integrated Lake-Watershed Acidification Study (ILWAS) model. To simulate terrestrial liming, calcite was applied to treated subcatchments as a rapidly weathering mineral in the upper horizon. Soil solution and lake outlet chemistry showed a response to calcite addition within four months of the start of the simulation. Calcium concentrations, acid neutralizing capacities (ANC), and pH increased in the upper soil layer and aluminum concentrations decreased in the upper three soil layers (0-70 cm). The response of ANC was delayed in lower soil layers due to proton production associated with aluminum hydrolysis. Moreover, soil water pH in the third soil layer decreased in response to calcite treatment due to the displacement of hydrogen ions by calcium added to the exchange complex. Calcium concentrations, ANC and pH increased and aluminum concentrations decreased in the simulated lake outlet. The modeled effects of calcite treatment on the soil and lake outlet chemistry were not as great as field observations. This was, in part, attributed to the model representation of the watershed, which did not include streams, ponds, or wetlands located in the treated subcatchments. Calcite applied to these saturated areas in the field readily dissolved, supplying ANC to lake water. Additionally, incorporation of calcite into a thick organic layer in the model diminished the possibility of dissolution by contact with overland flow. Observed concentrations of calcium, ANC, and pH in the outlet decreased after high values in the two years after treatment. Although the model failed to match observed short-term data, it may simulate the long-term response as calcium is transported through the soil. A long-term simulation of the model suggests that effects of base treatment will persist for at least 50 years.
1469753|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and dissolved organic matter (DOM) character were investigated in soil water (15 and 40 cm) and streams at eleven sites in Olympic National Park. In addition, the effect of added nitrogen on soil water DOM concentration and composition was tested. Forested plots covering a gradient of precipitation, climate, slope, and aspect in Olympic National Park were fertilized with the addition of 20, 10 and zero (control) kg urea-N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>. Seven sites had the two different fertilizer treatments and control plots, while the additional four sites had no fertilizer treatments. Soil water DOC concentrations ranged from 0.5 mg C/L to 54.1 mg C/L, with an average value of 14.1 mg C/L. Streams had low DOC concentrations ranging from 0.2 mg C/L to 4.4 mg C/L, with an average value of 1.2 mg C/L. DOM composition was examined with regard to molar ratios, H:C, O:C and N:C, index of unsaturation, average carbon oxidation state, and specific absorbance. Fertilizer had no consistent effect on either DOM concentration or composition across the study sites. Soil depth influenced both DOM concentration and composition. Shallow soil water DOM had greater concentrations, higher specific absorbance, a higher degree of unsaturation, and had lower molar ratios compared to deep soil water samples. Overall, changes in DOM stoichiometry and specific absorbance as a function of soil depth were consistent despite the diversity of the forested study sites sampled.
24715347|Wetland ecosystems have a high carbon storage potential as a result of high primary productivity and low decomposition rates dictated by water saturation. In the herbaceous wetlands of the Paran River Delta, drainage and afforestation with poplars represents one of the dominant land uses. We explored the effects of these interventions on the volume and carbon storage of the young sedimentary soils of the region. At three sites we identified paired stands occupying similar landscape positions and soil types but subject to natural flooding and covered by natural herbaceous communities or drainage and flood control by dikes and covered by poplar plantations established 12, 17 and 19 years ago. Soil sampling at these sites revealed a reduction of the litter compartment (86 %) and decreasing volume and porosity of its underlying mineral layer (010 cm in the wetland reduced to 04 cm in the plantation). Our comparisons of carbon storage accounted for these volumetric shifts by using accumulated mineral mass rather than depth as a reference, showing that tree plantations gained in the mineral soil (22 Mg C ha) almost as much as what they lost in the litter. These gains were particularly large at intermediate depths (443 cm in the plantations) were soil porosity remained unaffected and C was raised by 64 % explained by (1) the pulse of inputs from overlaying litter and organic layers subject to rapid decomposition and mobilization after drainage and (2) root colonization, since tree plantations had 75 % of their fine root biomass at these intermediate soil depths, whereas roots in the wetlands did not explore the mineral soil profile and were completely confined to the organic layer. A neutral C balance following wetland drainage and afforestation resulted from the opposing effects of aeration, favoring decomposition in the organic layer, root colonization and organic matter stabilization, favoring its accumulation in the mineral soil.
1469919| The effect of microorganisms on the fate of Cd introduced into the soil as cadmium oxide (CdO) was investigated. Cadmium oxide (875 g Cd per gram of soil) was added to -irradiated (sterile) and non-sterile soils. The soils were incubated for 90 days at 18 C under aerobic conditions with moisture kept at 60% of water-holding capacity. Half of the samples in each treatment were supplemented with starch (0.5%, w/w) in order to stimulate microbial growth in the non-sterile soil. After various time intervals (7- or 10-day), soil samples from each treatment were extracted with deionized distilled water (ratio 1:40) or 0.25 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (ratio 1:5). The results indicated that during the incubation period the amount of Cd extracted from the non-sterile soil with either solvent was markedly lower than that extracted from the -irradiated sterile control. The addition of starch to the non-sterile soil reduced the concentration of Cd in the 0.25 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> extracts without affecting the Cd-content in the water extracts. Short-term experiments in which Cd was added to the soil as a solution of Cd(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> indicated that irradiation did not affect the sorption of Cd to the soil. The addition of bacterial mass (1 mg of dry weight g<sup>-1</sup> soil) decreased the amount of Cd extracted with water as well as that extracted with 0.25 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Under sterile conditions the solubility of CdO in soil extracts was higher than in the other extractants. The addition of glucose (0.5%, w/w) or a glucose/starch mixture (0.5%, w/w of each) to the sterile soil increased the amount of extractable Cd after a short incubation (18 h at 18 C). The obtained results suggest that primarily physicochemical reactions are involved in dissolving CdO in the soil but that microbial activity may be responsible for the immobilization of the released metal. 
1469004|Direct groundwater inputs are receiving increasing attention as a potential source of nutrients and other dissolved constituents to the coastal ocean. Seepage into St. George Sound, Florida was measured extensively from 1992 to 1994 using seepage meters. Spatial and temporal variations were documented along a 7-km stretch of coastline and up to 1 km from shore. Measurements were made at 3 transects perpendicular to shore and 1 transect parallel to shore. The general results indicated that seepage decreased with distance from shore (2 of 3 transects), and substantial temporal and spatial variability was observed in seepage flow from nearshore sediments. In addition, trends in mean monthly integrated seepage rates were similar to precipitation patterns measured at a nearby coastal weather station. Based on these measurements, we estimate that the magnitude of groundwater seepage into the study area is substantial, representing from 0.23 to 4.4 m<sup>3</sup> sec<sup>-1</sup> of flow through the sediments, approximately equivalent to a first magnitude spring. Although it is unknown how representative this region is with respect to global groundwater discharge, it demonstrates that groundwater flow can be as important as riverine and spring discharge in some cases. Our subsurface discharge rates suggest groundwater is an important hydrologic source term for this region and may be important to the coastal biogeochemistry as well.
24715136|We investigated the depositional trends of total particles, carbon and nitrogen in a newly created, 600-km hydroelectric reservoir in Northern Qubec, and compared the results with those observed in lakes of the surrounding region. We show that particulate fluxes exhibit a large degree of spatial heterogeneity in both the reservoir (68548 mg POC m d and 533 mg PN m d) and the natural lakes (30150 mg POC m d and 312 mg PN m d) and that on average, settling fluxes of the reservoir (211  46 mg POC m d and 14  3 mg PN m d) exceeded lake deposition (79  13 mg POC m d and 7  1 mg PN m d) by approximately two-fold. Our results also show that the nature of the organic matter reaching the sediments was significantly different between lakes and the reservoir, which can have consequences for benthic metabolism and the long-term storage. We found that sinking fluxes in the reservoir were mostly regulated by local morphological and hydrological conditions, with higher fluxes along or in the vicinity of the old riverbed (average 400  73 mg POC m d and 24  5 mg PN m d) and lower fluxes in calmer zones such as side bays (average 106  10 mg POC m d and 8  1 mg PN m d). In lakes, where settling fluxes were not linked to the trophy, or dissolved organic carbon, the actual nature of the sedimenting organic material was influenced by lake morphometry and the relative contribution of algal versus terrestrial sources. We conclude that re-suspension and erosion play a major role in shaping the reservoir sinking fluxes which explain both, the higher reservoir deposition and also some of the qualitative differences between the two systems. Despite all these differences, sinking particulate organic carbon fluxes were small and surprisingly similar relative to the surface carbon dioxide emissions in both the reservoir and lakes, representing approximately 1617 % of the carbon efflux estimated for these same systems in 2008.
1469039|Processes operating at the terrestrial-lotic interface may significantly alter dissolved nitrogen concentrations in groundwater as a result of shifting redox conditions and microbial communities. We monitored concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, O<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> for 10 months along two transects tracing groundwater flow from an upland (terra firme) forest, beneath the riparian forest, and into the stream channel of a small Central Amazonian catchment. Our aim was to examine the role of near-stream processes in regulating groundwater transfers of dissolved nitrogen from terrestrial to lotic ecosystems in the Central Amazon. We found pronounced compositional differences in inorganic nitrogen chemistry between upland, riparian, and stream hydrologic compartments. Nitrate dominated (average 89% of total inorganic nitrogen; TIN) the inorganic nitrogen chemistry of oxygenated upland groundwater but decreased markedly upon crossing the upland-riparian margin. Conversely, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> dominated (average 93% of TIN) the inorganic chemistry of apparently anoxic riparian groundwater; NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and TIN concentrations decreased markedly across the riparian-stream channel margin. In the oxygenated streamwater, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> again dominated (average 82% of TIN) inorganic nitrogen chemistry. Denitrification followed by continued ammonification is hypothesized to effect the shift in speciation observed at the upland-riparian margin, while a combination of several processes may control the shift in speciation and loss of TIN observed at the riparian-stream margin. Dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations did not vary significantly between upland and riparian groundwater, but decreased across the riparian-stream margin. Our data suggest that extensive transformation reactions focused at the upland and stream margins of the riparian zone strongly regulate and diminish transfers of inorganic nitrogen from groundwater to streamwater in the catchment. This suggestion questions the veracity of attempts in the literature to link stream nitrogen chemistry with nutrient status in adjacent forests of similar catchments in the Central Amazon. It also complicates efforts to model nitrogen transfers across terrestrial-lotic interfaces in response to deforestation and changing climate.
40343585|Total emissions of NO from drained organic forest soils in Sweden were estimated using an equation linking the C: N ratio of the soil to NO emissions. Information on soil C:N ratios was derived from a national database. It was estimated that the emissions from Histosols amount to 2,820 tonnes NO a. This is almost five times the value calculated for the same soils using the method suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: 580 tonnes NO a. The higher value in the present study can mainly be explained by improved accuracy of estimates of NO emissions from nutrient-rich soils, including former agricultural soils. In Sweden, in addition to 0.94 Mha of drained Histosols, there are 0.55 Mha of other types of drained organic soils. The annual emissions from these soils were estimated to amount to 1,890 tonnes of NO. The total emission value calculated for drained organic forest soils was thus 4,700 tonnes NO a, which, if added, would increase the current estimate of the Swedish anthropogenic NO source strength by 18%. Of these emissions, 88% occur from sites with C:N ratios lower than 25. The exponential relationship between C:N ratio and NO emissions, in combination with a scarcity of data, resulted in large confidence intervals around the estimates. However, by using the C:N ratio-based method, NO emission estimates can be calculated from a variable that is readily available in databases. Also, the recent findings that there are exceptionally large emissions of NO from the most nitrogen-rich drained organic forest soils are taken into account.
1468976| Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, Thiobacillus thiooxidans, were found in a highly acidic (pH = 11.5) crater lake, Yugama, seasonally flowing streams and soil in the catchment area of the crater. Thiobacillus ferrooxidans was also found in some of the streams but not in the lake itself. The lake water contains aqueous carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, polythionates and elemental sulfur in suspension which are the substrates for the growth of the sulfur-oxidizing bacteria as no organic compounds except for the microorganisms themselves were detected. The bacteria isolated from the Yugama water preferred polythionates in the following order: <latex>$\text{S}_{4}\text{O}_{6}^{2-}>\text{S}_{5}\text{O}_{6}^{2-}>\text{S}_{6}\text{O}_{6}^{2-}$</latex>. On the other hand, H<sub>2</sub>S was more rapidly consumed by the bacteria than polythionates which were followed by elemental sulfur. In the case of test-tube incubation, the optimum pH of the solution for growth of the bacteria was between 1.0 and 1.5, and for cultivation in growth medium plates between 2.5 and 3.5. The bacteria hardly proliferated at pH 0.5 or below. In accordance with these characteristics of the bacteria, numbers of the bacteria in the surface Yugama crater lake water were at minimum (<a few cells/mL) in February and at maximum (10<sup>6</sup> cell/mL) in August. The bacterial activity changed in accordance with the surface lake water temperature, but not necessarily with the variations in H<sub>2</sub>S and polythionates concentrations of the lake water. Based on the variation in sulfur isotope ratios of sulfate and experimentally determined rate of oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>S in the lake water, the sulfate production rate by the bacteria in the catchment area and the lake were estimated to 9.5 and 8.4 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day, respectively, during the period from 1988 to 1990 when the volcanic activity at Yugama was at minimum. Also stream, hydrothermal, H<sub>2</sub>S-oxidated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> inputs and outputs by seepage and precipitation have been calculated as 4.1, 32, 0.56, 36, and 1.2 ton/day, respectively. 
1469089| Spatial trends in pre-industrial biomass burning emissions for eastern North America were reconstructed from sediment charcoal data. Petrographic thin sections were prepared from varved lake sediments along a transect of sites extending from NW Minnesota eastward to NE Maine. Results showed an exponential decline in charcoal abundance with distance east from the prairie/forest border. This result quantifies burning along the broad climate/vegetation gradient from xeric woodland to mesic eastern deciduous forest. Post-settlement charcoal accumulation showed no such geographic pattern, varying from site-to-site, likely reflecting local variability in land use and combustion sources. Results suggest the total emissions of large (> 10 m diameter) charcoal particles decreased by a factor of three during the twentieth century. 
24715191|Using mass budget and hydrological models, we quantified the contribution of major diffuse nitrogen (N) sources to surface water loading in a large heterogeneous catchment (upper Vltava river, Czech Republic, about 13,000 km) over the last 52 years. The catchment reflects the typical development in central and eastern European countries, which witnessed socio-economic shifts from a market to a planned economy in the 1950s and back to a market economy in the 1990s. The former shift was accompanied by increasing N inputs to agricultural and forest areas with ranges for the 19501980s of 60160 and 1430 kg ha year, respectively, and with intensive draining of waterlogged farmland. The shift in the 1990s resulted in ~40 and ~50 % reduction of N inputs to agricultural areas and forests, respectively, and farmland draining ceased. The N exports from agricultural land (EAL) and from forests (EFO) varied within 345 and 1.67.1 kg ha year, respectively (with maxima in the 1980s). The EAL and EFO fluxes exhibited several similar patterns, being dominated by NON, increasing with N inputs, and having similar inter-annual variability related to hydrology. The N losses from forests were stable (19 % of N input on average), while those from agricultural land increased from ~ 10 % in the 1960s up to 32 % in the 2000s, due probably to the previous extensive drainage and tillage of waterlogged fields and pastures. These land use changes reduced the water residence time in agricultural land and induced mineralization of soil organic matter. Continuing mineralization of soil organic N pools thus was the most probable reason for the remaining high EAL fluxes despite a ~40 % reduction in N inputs to agricultural land, while the EFO fluxes decreased proportionally to the decreasing N deposition during 19902010.
1468837| Microbial biomass nitrogen was measured in unamended (dry) and wetted soils in ten shrubland and grassland communities of the Chihuahuan desert, southern New Mexico, by the fumigation-extraction method. Microbial biomass-N in dry soils was undetectable. Average microbial biomass-N in wetted soils among all plant communities was 15.3 g g<sup>-1</sup> soil. Highest values were found in the communities with the lowest topographic positions, and the minimum values were detected in the spaces between shrubs. Microbial biomass was positively and significantly correlated to soil organic carbon and extractable nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). In a stepwise multiple regression, organic carbon and extractable nitrogen accounted for 40.9 and 5.6%, respectively, of the variance in microbial biomass-N among all the samples. Among communities, the soil microbial biomass was affected by the ratio of carbon to extractable nitrogen. Our results suggest a succession in the control of microbial biomass from nitrogen to carbon when the ratio of carbon to nitrogen decreases during desertification. 
1469556|Crop-based agriculture occupies 1.7 billion hectares, globally, with a soil C stock of about 170 Pg. Of the past anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> additions to the atmosphere, about 50 Pg C came from the loss of soil organic matter (SOM) in cultivated soils. Improved management practices, however, can rebuild C stocks in agricultural soils and help mitigate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Increasing soil C stocks requires increasing C inputs and/or reducing soil heterotrophic respiration. Management options that contribute to reduced soil respiration include reduced tillage practices (especially no-till) and increased cropping intensity. Physical disturbance associated with intensive soil tillage increases the turnover of soil aggregates and accelerates the decomposition of aggregate-associated SOM. No-till increases aggregate stability and promotes the formation of recalcitrant SOM fractions within stabilized micro- and macro- aggregate structures. Experiments using <sup>13</sup>C natural abundance show up to a two-fold increase in mean residence time of SOM under no-till vs intensive tillage. Greater cropping intensity, i.e., by reducing the frequency of bare fallow in crop rotations and increasing the use of perennial vegetation, can increase water and nutrient use efficiency by plants, thereby increasing C inputs to soil and reducing organic matter decomposition rates. Management and policies to sequester C in soils need to consider that: soils have a finite capacity to store C, gains in soil C can be reversed if proper management is not maintained, and fossil fuel inputs for different management practices need to be factored into a total agricultural CO<sub>2</sub> balance.
24715150|Permeable sediments comprise the majority of shelf sediments, yet the rates of denitrification remain highly uncertain in these environments. Computational models are increasingly being used to understand the dynamics of denitrification in permeable sediments, which are complex environments to study experimentally. The realistic implementation of such models requires reliable experimentally derived data on the kinetics of denitrification. Here we undertook measurements of denitrification kinetics as a function of nitrate concentration in carefully controlled flow through reactor experiments on sediments taken from six shallow coastal sites in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia. The results showed that denitrification commenced rapidly (within 30 min) after the onset of anoxia and the kinetics could be well described by MichaelisMenten kinetics with half saturation constants (apparent Km) ranging between 1.5 and 19.8 M, and maximum denitrification rate (Vmax) were in the range of 0.97.5 nmol mL h. The production of N through anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) was generally found to be less than 10 % of denitrification. Vmax were in the same range as previously reported in cohesive sediments despite organic carbon contents one order of magnitude lower for the sediments studied here. The ratio of sediment O consumption to Vmax was in the range of 0.020.09, and was on average much lower than the theoretical ratio of 0.8. As a consequence, models implemented with the theoretical ratio of 0.8 are likely to overestimate denitrification by a factor of 3. The most likely explanation for this is that the microbial community is not able to instantaneously shift or optimally use a particular electron acceptor in the highly dynamic redox environment experienced in permeable sediments. In contrast to previous studies, we did not observe any significant rates of oxic denitrification.
24715147|In strongly weathered soils, leaf litter not only returns phosphorus (P) to the soil environment, it may also modify soil properties and soil solution chemistry, with the potential to decrease phosphate sorption and increase plant available P. Using a radioactive phosphate tracer (P) and 1 h laboratory incubations we investigated the effect of litter inputs on phosphate sorption over two time scales: (1) long-term field litter manipulations (litter addition, control and litter removal) and (2) pulses of litter leachate (i.e. water extracts of leaf litter) from five species. Leachate pulse effects were compared to a simulated throughfall, which served as a control solution. Soil receiving long-term doubling of leaf litter maintained five-fold more phosphate in solution than the litter removal soil. In addition to the quantity of phosphate sorbed, the field litter addition treatment decreased the strength of phosphate sorption, as evaluated through extraction of sorbed P using a weakly acidic ammonium fluoride solution (Bray 1). In litter removal soil, leachate pulses significantly reduced phosphate sorption in comparison to the throughfall control for all five species evaluated. However, the ability of leachate pulses to reduce phosphate sorption decreased when soil had received field litter inputs. Across soils the effect of leachate pulses on phosphate sorption increased with net sorption of dissolved organic C, with the exception of leachate from one species that had a higher index of aromatic C concentration. These results demonstrate that litter inputs, as both long-term inputs and short-term leachate pulses, can decrease the quantity and strength of phosphate sorption, which may increase the biological availability of this key nutrient.
20456469|Despite numerous investigations, the number and role of morphotypes involved in the life cycle of Phaeocystis species remain under debate. This is partly due to the application of different methodologies such as light, transmission, scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry on specific samples. This heterogeneity of approaches results in the incomplete morphometric description of the different cell types existing within one species according to relevant criteria and the indetermination of the ploidy level of each observed stage. We review here the different morphotypes observed within each of the six Phaeocystis species recognized up to now. Four different cell types have been observed. In common to all six species is the occurrence of a scaly flagellate producing star-forming filaments (all species except P. jahnii) or not (P. globosa and P. jahnii). In three colony-forming species, P. globosa, P. pouchetii and P. antarctica, three morphotypes are observed: a flagellate with scales and filaments, a colonial cell, and a flagellate devoid of scales and filaments. In the non-colony-forming species, P. scrobiculata and P. cordata, only flagellates with scales and filaments have been observed. While suspected in P. pouchetii and P. antarctica, a haploid-diploid life cycle has only been evidenced for P. globosa. The two main prominent features of this cycle are that sexuality is prevalent in colony bloom formation and termination and that two types of vegetative reproduction exist. The ecological relevance of alternating haploid and diploid stages is not clearly apparent on the basis of existing ecological studies.
20519800|The hydroxyl radical (OH) plays an important role in the environmental chemistry and biogeochemistry of surface waters. OH acts as a strong oxidant within the irradiated water column, and affects the bioavailability, cycling, and mineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), the speciation and redox state of important trace metals e.g., iron and copper, and the fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The generation of this species from irradiated DOM may be especially important in Arctic surface waters during the boreal summer, which contains high levels of DOM and experiences continual solar irradiance. Here, we investigate the OH produced from laser irradiated Arctic DOM isolated from Toolik Lake, AK (6838 N, 14943 W). We measured the wavelength dependence of OH production for aqueous solutions of DOM and report that the greatest OH production occurs at wavelengths less than 360 nm. OH production rates ranged from 1.7 (0.1)10 M h to 6.4 (0.2)10 M h, with the rate depending on both irradiation wavelength and to a lesser degree the method used to isolate the DOM matrix. These findings lead to a better understanding of the potentially important photo-oxidation processes that may impact DOM cycling in the Arctic.
1469459|In a laboratory experiment, different iron salts (FeCl<sub>2</sub>, FeCl<sub>3</sub>, FeSO<sub>4</sub>) and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> were added to a phosphate enriched silty loam sediment in order to study their effect on phosphate mobilisation. Phosphate concentrations in sediment pore water were not reduced by the addition of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Addition of both iron chlorides, however, resulted in a strong decrease of phosphate levels in sediment pore water. A similar but less pronounced effect was caused by the addition of iron as iron(II) sulphate. Sulphate appears to counteract the immobilisation of phosphate brought about by iron(II). Phosphate release from the sediment appeared to be determined by the iron/phosphate ratio in the sediment pore water. The addition of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> barely affected the phosphate release from the sediment whereas the addition of iron salts was effective in preventing phosphate release. Increased amounts of iron added to the sediment resulted in a decreased phosphate release.
1469896|Although dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from the forest floor plays a crucial role in transporting carbon and major nutrients through the soil profile, its formation and responses to changing litter inputs are only partially understood. To gain insights into the controlling mechanisms of DOM release from the forest floor, we investigated responses of the concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) in forest floor leachates to manipulations of throughfall (TF) flow and aboveground litter inputs (litter removal, litter addition, and glucose addition) at a hardwood stand in Bavaria, Germany. Over the two-year study period, litter manipulations resulted in significant changes in C and N stocks of the uppermost organic horizon (Oi). DOC and DON losses via forest floor leaching represented 8 and 11% of annual litterfall C and N inputs at the control, respectively. The exclusion of aboveground litter inputs caused a slight decrease in DOC release from the Oi horizon but no change in the overall leaching losses of DOC and DON in forest floor leachates. In contrast, the addition of litter or glucose increased the release of DOC and DON either from the Oi or from the lower horizons (Oe + Oa). Net releases of DOC from the Oe + Oa horizons over the entire manipulation period were not related to changes in microbial activity (measured as rates of basal and substrate-induced respiration) but to the original forest floor depths prior to manipulation, pointing to the flux control by the size of source pools rather than a straightforward relationship between microbial activity and DOM production. In response to doubled TF fluxes, net increases in DOM fluxes occurred in the lower forest floor, indicating the presence of substantial pools of potentially soluble organic matter in the Oe + Oa horizons. In contrast to the general assumption of DOM as a leaching product from recent litter, our results suggest that DOM in forest floor leachates is derived from both newly added litter and older organic horizons through complex interactions between microbial production and consumption and hydrologic transport.
40343752|The extent to which in-stream processes alter or remove nutrient loads in agriculturally impacted streams is critically important to watershed function and the delivery of those loads to coastal waters. In this study, patch-scale rates of in-stream benthic processes were determined using large volume, open-bottom benthic incubation chambers in a nitrate-rich, first to third order stream draining an area dominated by tile-drained row-crop fields. The chambers were fitted with sampling/mixing ports, a volume compensation bladder, and porewater samplers. Incubations were conducted with added tracers (NaBr and either N[NO], or N[NO N[NH]) for 24-44 h intervals and reaction rates were determined from changes in concentrations and isotopic compositions of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and nitrogen gas. Overall, nitrate loss rates (220-3,560 mol N m h) greatly exceeded corresponding denitrification rates (34-212mol N m h) and both of these rates were correlated with nitrate concentrations (90-1,330 M), which could be readily manipulated with addition experiments. Chamber estimates closely matched whole-stream rates of denitrification and nitrate loss using N. Chamber incubations with acetylene indicated that coupled nitrification/denitrification was not a major source of N production at ambient nitrate concentrations (175M), but acetylene was not effective for assessing denitrification at higher nitrate concentrations (1,330 M). Ammonium uptake rates greatly exceeded nitrification rates, which were relatively low even with added ammonium (3.5 mol N m h), though incubations with nitrite demonstrated that oxidation to nitrate exceeded reduction to nitrogen gas in the surface sediments by fivefold to tenfold. The chamber results confirmed earlier studies that denitrification was a substantial nitrate sink in this stream, but they also indicated that dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) turnover rates greatly exceeded the rates of permanent nitrogen removal via denitrification.
41410555|This study investigates the influence of organic matter (OM) on the historical variations of Hg in sediments from two closely-situated Canadian Arctic lakes, prior to the advent of Hg pollution inputs. Because of variable landscape evolution in the Mackenzie River Delta over the past 1-3 millennia, the lakes provide distinctly different histories of OM sources, types, and degree of aquatic productivity (i.e., depositional environments). They also differ significantly in their pre-1900 Hg concentration profiles. When labile, kerogen-like carbon ("S2") from aquatic sources (diatoms and other unicellular algae) increased between 750 and 1900 A.D. in the more productive lake (Nesbitt), Hg concentrations also increased by ca. 50%. In contrast, S2 carbon concentrations in the nearby organic-poor lake (Big Lake) were several-times lower than in Nesbitt and decreased over the past millennium, while Hg concentrations showed no trend probably reflecting the stable input of clastic material from tundra soils. The contrast between lakes suggests that OM derived from unicellular algae is more effective at scavenging Hg than OM from terrestrial plants or aquatic macrophytes, possibly because of a higher content of labile, sulphur-rich compounds, high particle surface area and its dispersion throughout the water column. The results indicate that, in the absence of anthropogenic Hg inputs, increasing phytoplankton productivity and Hg scavenging alone can lead to significant increases in the Hg content of lake sediments. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that increasing lake productivity because of climate warming during the twentieth century has confounded the interpretation of recently increasing Hg levels in northern lake sediments as being unequivocally due to anthropogenic Hg deposition. This study also suggests that sedimentary TOC by itself is a poor and sometimes misleading indicator of possible changes in the source and quality of OM in aquatic systems, which can have a major impact on Hg concentrations in sediments. more productive lake (Nesbitt), Hg concentrations also increased by ca. 50%.

41490494|The transfer of carbon (C) from Amazon forests to aquatic ecosystems as CO supersaturated in groundwater that outgases to the atmosphere after it reaches small streams has been postulated to be an important component of terrestrial ecosystem and methane (CH) flux, direct CO and CH fluxes from the stream surface and fluvial export of dissolved inorganic (DIC), dissolved organic cycle from a 1,319-ha forested Amazon perennial first-order headwater watershed at Tanguro Ranch in the southern Amazon state of Mato Grosso. Stream pCO concentrations ranged from 6,491 to 14,976 uatm and directly-measured stream CO outgassing flux was 5,994  677 g Cm y of stream surface. Stream pCH concentrations ranged from 291 to 438 atm and measured stream CH outgassing flux was 987  221 g C m y Despite high flux rates from the stream surface, the small area of stream itself (970 m , or 0.007% of watershed area) led to small directly-measured annual fluxes of CO (0.44  0.05 g C m y) and CH (0.07  0.02 g C m y) per unit watershed land area. Measured fluvial export of DIC (0.78  0.04 g C m y), DOC (0.16  0.03 C m y) and coarse plus fine particulate C (0.001  0.001 g C m y) per unit watershed land area were also small. However, stream discharge accounted for only 12% of the modeled annual watershed water output because deep groundwater flows dominated total runoff from the watershed. When C in this bypassing groundwater was included, total watershed export was 10.83 g C m y as CO outgassing, 11.29 g C m y as fluvial DIC and 0.64 g C m y as fluvial DOC. Outgassing fluxes were somewhat lower than the 40-50 g C m y reported from other Amazon watersheds and may result in part from lower annual rainfall at Tanguro. Total stream-associated gaseous C losses were two orders of magnitude less than soil respiration (696  147 g C m y), but total losses of transported by water comprised up to about 20% of the  150 g C m ( 1.5 Mg C ha) that is exchanged annually across Amazon tropical forest canopies.
40800611|Atmospheric CO and CH exchange in peatlands is controlled by water table levels and soil moisture, but impacts of short periods of dryness and rainfall are poorly known. We conducted dryingrewetting experiments with mesocosms from an ombrotrophic northern bog and an alpine, minerotrophic fen. Efflux of CO and CH was measured using static chambers and turnover and diffusion rates were calculated from depth profiles of gas concentrations. Due to a much lower macroporosity in the fen compared to the bog peat, water table fluctuated more strongly when irrigation was stopped and resumed, about 11 cm in the fen and 5 cm in the bog peat. Small changes in air filled porosity caused CO and CH concentrations in the fen peat to be insensitive to changes in water table position. CO emission was by a factor of 5 higher in the fen than in the bog mesocosms and changed little with water table position in both peats. This was probably caused by the importance of the uppermost, permanently unsaturated zone for autoand heterotrophic CO production, and a decoupling of air filled porosity from water table position. CH emission was < 0.4 mmol m day in the bog peat, and up to > 12.6 mmol m day in the fen peat, where it was lowered by water table fluctuations. CH production was limited to the saturated zone in the bog peat but proceeded in the capillary fringe of the fen peat. Water table drawdown partly led to inhibition of methanogenesis in the newly unsaturated zone, but CH production appeared to continue after irrigation without time-lag. The identified effects of irrigation on soil moisture and respiration highlight the importance of peat physical properties for respiratory dynamics; but the atmospheric carbon exchange was fairly insensitive to the small-scale fluctuations induced.
1468871|A method was developed to evaluate the cumulative effect of wetland mosaics in the landscape on stream water quality and quantity in the nine-county region surrounding Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to record and measure 33 watershed variables derived from historical aerial photos. These watershed variables were then reduced to eight principal components which explained 86% of the variance. Relationships between stream water quality variables and the three wetland-related principal components were explored through stepwise multiple regression analysis. The proximity of wetlands to the sampling station was related to principal component two, which was associated with decreased annual concentrations of inorganic suspended solids, fecal coliform, nitrates, specific conductivity, flow-weighted NH<sub>4</sub>, flow-weighted total P, and a decreased proportion of phosphorus in dissolved form (p < 0.05). Wetland extent was related to decreased specific conductivity, chloride, and lead concentrations. The wetland-related principal components were also associated with the seasonal export of organic matter, organic nitrogen, and orthophosphate. Relationships between water quality and wetlands components were different for time-weighted averages as compared to flow-weighted averages. This suggests that wetlands were more effective in removing suspended solids, total phosphorus, and ammonia during high flow periods but were more effective in removing nitrates during low flow periods.
1468765|Sulfur is an important element in the metabolism of salt marshes and subtidal, coastal marine sediments because of its role as an electron acceptor, carrier, and donor. Sulfate is the major electron acceptor for respiration in anoxic marine sediments. Anoxic respiration becomes increasingly important in sediments as total respiration increases, and so sulfate reduction accounts for a higher percentage of total sediment respiration in sediments where total respiration is greater. Thus, sulfate accounts for 25% of total sediment respiration in nearshore sediments (200 m water depth or less) where total respiration rates are 0.1 to 0.3 g Cm<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>, for 50% to 70% in nearshore sediments with higher rates of total respiration (0.3 to 3 g C m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>), and for 70% to 90% in salt marsh sediments where total sediment respiration rates are 2.5 to 5.5 g C m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>. During sulfate reduction, large amounts of energy from the respired organic matter are conserved in inorganic reduced sulfur compounds such as soluble sulfides, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, iron monosulfides, and pyrite. Only a small percentage of the reduced sulfur formed during sulfate reduction is accreted in marine sediments and salt marshes. When these reduced sulfur compounds are oxidized, energy is released. Chemolithoautotrophic bacteria which catalyze these oxidations can use the energy of oxidation with efficiencies (the ratio of energy fixed in organic biomass to energy released in sulfur oxidation) of up to 21-37% to fix CO<sub>2</sub> and produce new organic biomass. Chemolithoautotrophic bacterial production may represent a significant new formation of organic matter in some marine sediments. In some sediments, chemolithoautotrophic bacterial production may even equal or exceed organoheterotrophic bacterial production. The combined cycle of anaerobic decomposition through sulfate reduction, energy conservation as reduced sulfur compounds, and chemolithoautotrophic production of new organic carbon serves to take relatively low-quality organic matter from throughout the sediments and concentrate the energy as living biomass in a discrete zone near the sediment surface where it can be readily grazed by animals.
20456413|Abundance of D isomers of amino acids has been used in studies of organic matter diagenesis to determine the contribution of bacterial biomass to the organic matter, especially in marine sediments. However, fluxes of D amino acids in pelagic waters are poorly known. Here we present seasonal changes (March-September) in concentrations of dominant D amino acids in the pool of dissolved free and combined (hydrolysable) amino acids (DFAA and DCAA) in the shallow Roskilde Fjord, Denmark. The amino acid dynamics are related to pelagic bacterial density and activity and abundance of viruses. D isomers made up 3.6 and 7.9% of the DFAA and DCAA (average values), respectively, and had similar seasonal variations in concentrations. In batch cultures (0.7- and 0.2-m filtered water in a 1:9 mixture) microbial activity reduced L+D DCAA concentrations in seven of ten sampling dates, while DCAA were released at the remaining three sampling times.
41490444|Under arid and semiarid conditions, pedogenic (secondary) carbonates are formed in soil by precipitation of Ca from soil parent material with dissolved CO originating from root and rhizomicrobial respiration. C values of secondary CaCO record the photosynthetic pathway of former vegetation and is therefore used as a tool for paleoenvironmental studies. The time scale of pedogenic carbonate formation as well as the influence of several environmental factors are crucial, yet poorly known. We estimated the recrystallization rate of pedogenic carbonate by the C isotopic exchange method. CO was assimilated by plants, respired into the rhizosphere and subsequently incorporated into secondary carbonate by recrystallization of primary loess carbonate. With ascending number of CO pulses, the amount of rhizosphere C recovered in loess CaCO increased linearly, leading to recrystallization rates of 3.2 x 10 and 2.8 x 10 day for wheat and ryegrass, respectively. In loess close to roots, recrystallization rates more than twice as high were obtained. Extrapolating these rates we showed that several hundred years are necessary for complete recrystallization of primary loess CaCO in root-free substrate, assuming that both primary and secondary carbonate is recrystallized several times. In contrast, the process probably takes only decades in rhizosphere loess if carbonaceous encrustations form around the root, impeding repeated recrystallization. This indicates the importance of rhizosphere processes (e.g. respiration of roots and microorganisms, exudation) for secondary carbonate formation.
1468965| We investigated the effects of sulfate concentration on sulfate reduction and net S storage in lake sediments using <sup>34</sup>S as a tracer. The water overlying intact sediment cores from the hypolimnion of Mares Pond, MA, was replaced with two Na<sub>2</sub><sup>34</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> solutions at either ambient (70 M) or elevated (260 M) sulfate concentrations. The  <sup>34</sup>S of the added sulfate was 4974 . Over two months, the net sulfate reduction rate in the ambient sulfate treatment was zero, while the net rate for the high sulfate treatment was 140  moles/m<sup>2</sup>/d. The water overlying the cores was kept under oxic conditions and the sediment received no fresh carbon inputs, thus the net rate reported may underestimate the in situ rate. Gross sulfate reduction rates calculated by isotope dilution were approximately 350  moles/m<sup>2</sup>/d for both treatments. While the calculation of gross sulfate reduction rates in intact sediment cores can be complicated by differential diffusion of <sup>34</sup>S and <sup>32</sup>S, isotopic fractionation, and the possible formation of ester sulfates, we believe these effects to be small. The results suggest that sulfate reduction is not strongly sulfate-limited in Mares Pond. The difference in net sulfate reduction rates between treatments resulted from a decrease in sulfide oxidation and suggests the importance of reoxidation in controlling net S storage in lake sediments. In both treatments the CRS and organic S fractions were measurably labelled in <sup>34</sup>S. Below the sediment surface, the CRS fraction was the more heavily labelled storage product for reduced sulfides. 
41490460|There are few records of long-term trends in C soil and N in grazed pasture systems but recent measurements have demonstrated unexplained losses on New Zealand lowlands. To determine whether losses were also occurring in hill country pastures, we analyzed archived soil samples collected between 1983 and 2006 from two slope classes (steep and easy) at the Whatawhata Research Centre. Soils were Ultic Hapludand and Typic Haplohumult on the easy slopes (10-20) , and Typic Haplohumult on the steeper slopes (30-40). Soil samples (0-75 mm) had been collected from paddocks that were fertilized with six different loading rates of P (ranging from 0 to 100 kg P ha -year since 1985). This range of P loadings allowed us to determine whether P inputs would regulate trends in soil C and N. While there were significant temporal trends in and N (P < 0.05), these were not unidirectional and trends were not dependent on P loading rate. On average, soil C initially increased during the first 6 years of the trial at 0.270% C year (1.56 t ha year) and 0.156% year (1.06 t ha year) on easy and steep slopes, respectively. Subsequently, there was no significant trend in soil C on the easy slopes but soil declined at -0.066% year (0.45 t ha year) on the steep slopes. Similarly, soil N increased between 1983 and 1989 at 0.025% N year (144 kg ha year) and 0.012% N year (82 kg ha year) on easy and steep slopes, respectively. Post-1989, small but significant losses of total N were measured on the steep slopes of 0.004% year (27 kg N ha year) (P < 0.05) with no trend on the easy slopes. Two potential causal factors for these decadal-scale patterns were identified, operating via changes in primary productivity. These were lower S inputs from 1989 due to a change in fertilizer type, and a series of relatively dry summers during the 1990s. These significant inter-annual trends in soil C and N complicate attempts to measure long-term changes in soil organic matter associated with land use change and management practices. This study has demonstrated the potential error associated with infrequent soil sampling to determine long-term trends in soil C and N; large gains or losses could have been detected at Whatawhata depending on when sampling started and finished. Understanding these long-term trends in soil organic matter dynamics and driving factors requires more long-term sampling trials.
20055282|Rates of soil respiration (CO effluxes), subsurface pore gas CO/O concentrations, soil temperature and soil water content were measured for 15 months in two temperate and contrasting Danish forest ecosystems: beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.). Soil CO effluxes showed a distinct seasonal trend in the range of 0.48-3.3 mol CO
1469505| Nitrogen additions as NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> corresponding to 0 (N0), 1 (N1), 3 (N3) and 10(N10) g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> were made to Sphagnum magellanicum cores at two-week intervals in situ at four sites across Europe, i.e. Lakkasuo (Finland), Mnnikjrve (Estonia), Moidach More (UK) and Cte de Braveix (France). The same treatments were applied in a glasshouse experiment in Neuchtel (Switzerland) in which the water table depth was artificially maintained at 7, 17 and 37 cm below the moss surface. In the field, N assimilation in excess of values in wet deposition occurred in the absence of growth, but varied widely between sites, being absent in Lakkasuo (moss N:P ratio 68) and greatest in Moidach More (N:P 21). In the glasshouse, growth was reduced by lowering the water table without any apparent effect on N assimilation. Total N content of the moss in field sites increased as the mean depth of water table increased indicating growth limitation leading to increased N concentrations which could reduce the capacity for N retention. Greater contents of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the underlying peat at 30 cm depth, both in response to NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> addition and in the unamended cores confirmed poor retention of inorganic N by the moss at Lakkasuo. Nitrate contents in the profiles at Lakkasuo, Moidach More, and Cte de Braveix were extremely low, even in the N10 treatment, but in Mnnikjrve, where the mean depth of water table was greatest and retention absent, appreciable amounts of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were detected in all cores. It is concluded that peatland drainage would reduce the capture of inorganic N in atmospheric deposition by Sphagnum mosses. 
1468760|Vertical profiles of total dissolved arsenic, manganese and iron, pH, Eh and rates of sulfate reduction were determined in a freshly-collected box core from a 335m depth station in the Laurentian Trough. The relationships observed between the profiles were further examined in the laboratory by measuring these same parameters with time in surficial sediment slurries as the Eh decreased in response to biological activity or chemical alteration. Both field and laboratory observations have shown that arsenic is released predominantly as As(III) into reducing sediment porewaters. This occurs after the dissolution of manganese oxides and at the same time as the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides and the onset of sulfate reduction. Laboratory experiments indicated that sulfate reduction and the production of sulfide ions are not solely responsible for the release of arsenic to the porewaters, although this process is necessary to create and maintain a highly reducing environment conducive to rapid iron dissolution. The diagenesis of arsenic in Laurentain Trough sediments involves the simultaneous release of arsenic and iron at a subsurface depth, followed by its removal from porewaters by precipitation and adsorption reactions after migration by diffusion along concentration gradients. A qualitative model is presented to describe the behavior of arsenic in coastal marine sediments.

24715189|In Prince Edward Island, Canada, widespread intensive potato productin has contributed to elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater and streams, and eutrophic or anoxic conditions occur regularly in several estuarine systems. In this research, the stable isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen in nitrate in intertidal groundwater discharge and stream water were used, in conjunction with water quality and quantity data and land use information, to better understand the characteristics of nitrate delivered to two small estuaries with contrasting land use in their contributory catchments. Most of the water samples collected during the two-year study had isotopic signatures that fell in the range expected for nitrate derived from ammonium-based fertilizers (26.5 % of the samples) or in the overlapping range formed between ammonium-based fertilizers and nitrate derived from soil (64 % of the samples). Overall, isotopic signatures spanned over relatively narrow ranges, and correlations with other water quality parameters, or catchment characteristics, were weak. Nitrate in groundwater discharge and surface water in the Trout River catchment exhibited significantly different isotopic signatures only for the nitrogen isotope, while in the McIntyre Creek catchment groundwater discharge and surface water had similar isotopic signatures. When the isotopic results for the waters from the two catchments were compared, the surface waters were found to be similar, while the isotopic signatures of nitrate in groundwater were distinct only for the nitrogen isotope. Denitrification in the two study catchments was not evident based on the isotopic results for nitrate; however, in the case of the Trout River catchment, where a small freshwater pond exists, an average nitrate load reduction of 14 % was inferred based on a comparison of nitrate loads entering and leaving the pond. Overall, it appears that natural attenuation processes, occurring either in the streams or groundwater flow systems, do not significantly reduce nitrate loading to these estuaries.
41410589|Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are thought to be important in the fertility of arid lands as gateways for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Studies on the Colorado Plateau have shown that an incomplete internal N cycle operates in BSCs that results in significant exports of dissolved organic N, ammonia and nitrate into the bulk soil through percolating water, thus mechanistically explaining their role as a N gateway. It is not known if this pattern is found in other arid regions. To examine this, we measured rates of major biogeochemical N-transformations in a variety of BSCs collected from the Colorado Plateau and the Mojave, Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Dinitrogen fixation and aerobic ammonia oxidation were prominent transformations at all sites. We found anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) rates to be below the detection limit in all cases, and at least 50-fold smaller than rates of N-fixation, making it an irrelevant process for these BSCs. Heterotrophic denitrification was also of little consequence for the flow of N, with rates at least an order of magnitude smaller than those of N-fixation. Thus we could confirm that despite the demonstrable differences in microbial community composition and soil material, BSCs from major biogeographic regions in arid North America displayed a remarkably consistent pattern of internal N cycling. The implications for arid land fertility drawn from previous studies in the Colorado Plateau appear applicable to BSCs across other arid regions of the Southwestern United States.
1468491|Seasonal patterns and annual rates of N inputs, outputs, and internal cycling were determined for an old-growth mixed-conifer forest floor in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Rates of net N mineralization within the forest floor, and plant N-uptake and leaching of inorganic N from the forest floor were 13, 10, and 9 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The Mediterranean-type climate appeared to have a significant effect on N cycling within this forest, such that all N-process and flow rates showed distrinct seasonal patterns. We estimated the forest floor supplies less than one-third of the total aboveground plant N-uptake in this forest. The rate of net nitrification within the forest floor was always low (<latex>$<1\ \text{kg-NO}_{3}^{-}\text{-N ha}^{-1}\ 30\text{d}^{-1}$</latex>). Mean residence times for organic matter and N in the forest floor were 13 and 34 years, respectively, suggesting that this forest floor layer is a site of net N immobilization within this ecosystem. We examined the influence of the forest floor on mineral soil N dynamics by injecting small amounts of <sup>15</sup>N-enriched (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solutions into the surface mineral soil with the forest floor present (+FF) or removed (-FF). K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> extractable NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, total inorganic-N, and total-N pool sizes in the mineral soil were initially increased after forest floor removal (after 4 months), but NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N and total inorganic-N were not significantly different thereafter. Microbial biomass-N and K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-extractable total-N pool sizes were also found to be larger in mineral soils without a forest floor after 1 and 1.3 years, respectively. Total <sup>15</sup>N-recovery was greater in the +FF treatment compared to the -FF treatment after 1-year (about 50% and 35%, respectively) but did not differ after 1.3 years (both about 35%), suggesting that the forest floor delays but does not prevent the N-loss from the surface mineral soil of this forest. We estimated using our <sup>15</sup>N data that fungal translocation from the mineral soil to the forest floor may be as large as 9 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (similar in magnitude to other N flows in this forest), and may account for all of the observed absolute increase of N in litter during the early stages of decomposition at this site. Our results suggest that the forest floor acts both as a source and sink for N in the mineral soil.
1469606|The elemental composition and spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids isolated from different sampling media (topsoil, ground and surface water) of a natural fen area (high portion of organic soils) were examined to reveal the effects of land use history. These effects need to be known if dissolved humic substances are to be a major factor in identifying the impact of present and future changes in land use. Dissolved fulvic acids (topsoil, groundwater) from highly degraded peatlands (due to a long-term agricultural use) exhibit lower C/N ratios, higher absorption in the UV spectra, and higher absorption at 1,620 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the FTIR spectra compared with fulvic acids from relatively intact peatlands. These properties illustrate that long-term agricultural use with high inputs results in increased aromatic structures and a further humification of dissolved fulvic acids due to very strong peat decomposition compared with relatively intact peatlands. Synchronous fluorescence spectra also indicate the higher level of aromatic structures within fulvic acids isolated from sites with long-term agricultural use (high peat decomposition) compared with a land use history resulting in a lower peat decomposition. The different sources of fulvic acids in surface water (precipitation, runoff, interflow, groundwater) are the main reason for these effects not being detected in fulvic acids isolated from surface water. Short-term changes in land use characterized by a transition from crop farming to an unimproved grassland were found not to affect the spectroscopic properties of dissolved fulvic acids. A humification index deduced from the synchronous fluorescence spectra is proposed. We have strong evidence that dissolved humic substances indicate changes in the environmental conditions (both anthropogenic and natural) of wetlands with a high proportion of organic soils.
20055257|Nitrogen (N) pollution is a problem in many large temperate zone rivers, and N retention in river channels is often small in these systems. To determine the potential for floodplains to act as N sinks during overbank flooding, we combined monitoring, denitrification assays, and experimental nitrate (NO-N) additions to determine how the amount and form of N changed during flooding and the processes responsible for these changes in the Wisconsin River floodplain (USA). Spring flooding increased N concentrations in the floodplain to levels equal to the river. As discharge declined and connectivity between the river and floodplain was disrupted, total dissolved N decreased over 75% from 1.41
4151473|Recent studies have suggested that the residence time of Pb in the forest floor may not be as long as previously thought, and there is concern that the large pulse of atmospheric Pb deposited in the 1960s and early 1970s may move rapidly through mineral soils and eventually contaminate groundwater.

20456546|Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations in large pristine rivers of East Asia (370 samples) are reported and the relationship to lithology (phosphorites, igneous apatite-bearing deposits), relief, climate (precipitation, temperature), and population density are investigated. The DRP concentration and yield of 93% of our samples were distinctly low (&lt;0.06-0.89 M DRP and &lt;0.0008-800 mol DRP/km/year). The samples with relatively high DRP (7% of our samples) were most likely from point sources of human sewage rather than P-rich lithology. The principal component analyses using DRP, dissolved major elements, pH, Sr, and Sr/Sr found DRP best grouped with dissolved Si and K. However, the correlation between DRP and dissolved Si is still not strong enough to justify using Si as a proxy of DRP export by chemical weathering. The large rivers draining the eastern Tibetan Plateau--the headwaters of the Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow--together supplied 3.0  10 mol DRP/year, 7%, 3%, and 17% of those at mouths, respectively, and were not dominant source regions of DRP. The mouth values of the East Siberian rivers were especially low and this was due to multiple factors, e.g., low precipitation and sparse population. Stepwise regression of various parameters like precipitation, temperature, runoff, population density and relief indicated that the concentrations were not affected by any single factor, but precipitation and secondarily population density explained up to 44% of the variability in the DRP yield of the East Asian rivers.
41490463|A combination of field measurements, laboratory experiments and model simulations were used to characterize the groundwater biogeochemical dynamics along a shallow monitoring well transect on a coastal hammock. A switch in the redox status of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) pool in the well at the upland/saltmarsh interface occurred over the spring-neap tidal transition: the DIN pool was dominated by nitrate during spring tide and by ammonium during neap tide. A density-dependent reaction-transport model was used to investigate the relative importance of individual processes to the observed N redox-switch. The observed N redox-switch was evaluated with regard to the roles of nitrification, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), ammonium adsorption, and variations in inflowing water geochemistry between spring and neap tides. Transport was driven by measured pressure heads and process parameterizations were derived from field observations, targeted laboratory experiments, and the literature. Modeling results suggest that the variation in inflow water chemistry was the dominant driver of DIN dynamics and highlight the importance of spring-neap tide variations in the high marsh, which influences groundwater biogeochemistry at the marsh-upland transition.
1469157|As part of an experimental study of air pollution effects on tree growth and health, we combined process studies with an ecosystem approach to evaluate the effects of acidic deposition on soil acidification, nutrient cycling and proton fluxes in miniature red spruce ecosystems. Ninety red spruce saplings were transplanted into 1-m diameter pots containing reconstructed soil profiles and exposed to simulated acid rain treatments of pH 3.1, 4.1 and 5.1 for four consecutive growing seasons. All the principal fluxes of the major elements were measured. During the first year of treatments, the disturbance associated with the transplanting of the experimental trees masked any treatment effects by stimulating N mineralization rates and consequent high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, cation, and H<sup>+</sup> flux through the soil profile. In subsequent years, leaching of base cations and labile Al was accelerated in the most intensive acid treatment and corresponding declines in soil pH and exchangeable pools of Ca and Mg and increases in exchangeable Al concentrations were observed in the organic horizon. Leaching of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> also was significantly higher in the pH 4.1 than in the pH 5.1 treatment. Flux of Ca from foliage and soil was increased in response to strong acid loading and root uptake increased to compensate for foliar Ca losses. In contrast, K cycling was dominated by root uptake and internal cycling and was relatively insensitive to strong acid inputs. Cation leaching induced by acidic deposition was responsible for the majority of H<sup>+</sup> flux in the pH 3.1 treatment in the organic soil horizon whereas root uptake accounted for most of the H<sup>+</sup> flux in the pH 4.1 and 5.1 treatments. Although no measurable effects on tree nutrition or health were observed, base cation leaching was significantly accelerated by acidic deposition, even at levels below that observed in the eastern U.S., warranting continued concern about acid deposition effects on the soil base status of forested ecosystems.
41410545|UV-B radiation activates the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from water and oxygen in many protein kinds, which having been discovered initially in antibodies, has been so far applied to explore new mechanisms in relation to immune defence. As shown here, the natural association of this common photocatalysis and catalase transforms UV-B photons into heat in a cyclic reaction that represents in biology a basic defence mechanism against UV-B radiation and cold, the activity of which drives the buoyancy and production of planktonic microorganisms in cold oceans. Moreover, given that UV-B radiation reaching the Earth's surface depends mainly on changes in the ozone layer, that defence mechanism over-activated by ozone depletion in microorganisms gathered at the top layer of the water column during seasonal production could result in accelerated sea ice melting, surface warming and ecosystem changes, such as is happening at high latitudes. Thus, one concludes that UV-B-driven photoproduction and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in plankton can be a new, hidden biogeochemical process under control of the ozone layer with important effects on the ecosystem and climate.
1469707|The Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York State have among the highest rates of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the United States. Some streams draining Catskill catchments have shown dramatic increases in nitrate concentrations while others have maintained low nitrate concentrations. Streams in which exchange occurs between surface and subsurface (i.e. hyporheic) waters are thought to be conducive to nitrate removal via microbial assimilation and/or denitrification. Hyporheic exchange was documented in the Neversink River in the southern Catskill Mountains, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) losses along hyporheic flowpaths were negligible. In this study, Neversink River water was amended with natural, bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) (leaf leachate) in a series of experimental mesocosms that simulated hyporheic flowpaths. DOC and N dynamics were examined before and throughout a three week BDOC amendment. In addition, bacterial production, dissolved oxygen demand, denitrification, and six extracellular enzyme activities were measured to arrive at a mechanistic understanding of potential DOC and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal along hyporheic flowpaths. There were marked declines in DOC and complete removal of nitrate in the BDOC amended mesocosms. Independent approaches were used to partition NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> loss into two fractions: denitrification and assimilation. Microbial assimilation appears to be the predominant process explaining N loss. These results suggest that variability in BDOC may contribute to temporal differences in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> export from streams in the Catskill Mountains.
1469088|The relative scavenging abilities of suspended particulate oxides (SPOX), and organic matter (SPOM) for Cd, Zn and Cu were evaluated in a small, anthropogenically influenced river. In addition, the factor most important in influencing the sorption density (A<sub>d</sub>: metal concentration associated with a given phase divided by the concentration of that geochemical phase in the suspended particulate pool) of each metal to SPOX and SPOM were identified through multiple linear regression analyses from the suite of: pH, temperature, dissolved metal concentration, and the concentration of the other particulate fraction. Results indicate that SPOX-SPOM interactions do occur in trace metal complexation reactions; and interactions are both phase and cation specific. Fe oxides are able to outcompete discrete organic binding sites for Cu and Zn as a relative decrease in the amount of these two cations sorbed to organic matter was observed with increasing particulate Fe oxides. SPOM concentration was identified as being most important in influencing Cu sorption densities associated with the SPOX fraction. Organic matter -- oxide complexes are postulated to occur that enhance oxide sorption of Cu such that relatively more Cu is sorbed to particulate oxides with increasing particulate organic matter concentrations. Dissolved concentrations of Cd and Zn were found to be most important in influencing the sorption densities for these two metals associated with the oxides fraction. The sorption behaviour appears to follow Freundlich isotherm behaviour where the amount sorbed is a function of the dissolved concentration.
1469480|This study examined the accumulation of organic carbon (C) and fractions of soil phosphorus (P) in soils developing in volcanic ash deposited in the 1883 eruption of Krakatau. Organic C has accumulated at rates of 45 to 127 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr during 110 years of soil development, resulting in profiles with as much as 14 kgC/m<sup>2</sup>. Most soil P is found in the HCl-extractable forms, representing apatite. A loss of HCl-extractable P from the surface horizons is associated with a marked accumulation of NaOH-extractable organic P bound to Al. A bioassay with hill rice suggests that P is limiting to plant growth in these soils, perhaps as a result of the rapid accumulation of P in organic forms.
20456567|Four-fold variation in leaf-litter Ca concentration among 14 tree species growing in a common garden in central Poland was linked to variation in soil pH, exchangeable Ca, soil base saturation, forest floor turnover rates, and earthworm abundance. Given the potential importance of tissue Ca to biogeochemical processes, in this study we investigated potential controls on leaf Ca concentrations using studies of both laboratory seedlings and 30-year-old trees in the field. We first assessed whether species differences in Ca concentration of green leaves and leaf litter were due to differences in Ca uptake, plant growth, or Ca translocation to different organs, by measuring seedlings of 6 of the 14 species grown under controlled conditions of varying Ca supply. We also investigated whether trees species with high Ca concentrations in green leaves and leaf litter access soil Ca to a greater extent than low-Ca species by growing more fine roots in high-Ca soil horizons. Root distribution in the field was determined in all 14 tree species by profile wall mapping and soil sampling of excavated pits. There was no correlation between horizon root count density (number of roots m) and exchangeable soil Ca, nor was there a correlation of stand-level leaf litter Ca with density of roots 45-100 cm deep in the soil, suggesting that a deeper root distribution does not result in greater Ca acquisition among these species. Variation among species in leaf Ca concentration of greenhouse seedlings was positively correlated with leaf Ca concentrations of mature trees, indicating that the same ranking in leaf Ca among species existed under controlled Ca supply. Species also differed in seedling growth response to Ca supply. Tilia, the species with the highest leaf Ca in the field, generated only 10% as much biomass and height at low relative to high Ca supply, whereas the other species exhibited no significant differences. Species exhibited differences in (i) partitioning of whole plant Ca and biomass to leaf, stem and root organs and (ii) the pattern of such partitioning between high and low Ca treatments. Our data support the hypothesis that although soil Ca supply can contribute to variation among trees in leaf and litter Ca concentration, innate physiological differences among species also can be a major cause for species variation.

1468753| The relative importance of nitrogen inputs from atmospheric deposition and biological fixation is reviewed in a number of diverse, non-agricultural terrestrial ecosystems. Bulk precipitation inputs of N (1-12 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup>) are the same order of magnitude as, or frequently larger than, the usual range of inputs from nonsymbiotic fixation (< 1 - 5 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup>), especially in areas influenced by industrial activity. Bulk precipitation measurements may underestimate total atmospheric deposition by 30-40% because they generally do not include all forms of wet and dry deposition. Symbiotic fixation generally ranges from  10-160 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup> in ecosystems where N-fixing species are present during early successional stages, and may exceed the range under unusual conditions. Rates of both symbiotic and nonsymbiotic fixation appear to be greater during early successional stages of forest development, where they have major impacts on nitrogen dynamics and ecosystem productivity. Fates and impacts of these nitrogen inputs are important considerations that are inadequately understood. These input processes are highly variable in space and time, and few sites have adequate comparative information on both nitrogen deposition and fixation. The existing information on N inputs is deficient in several areas: - more intensive studies of total atmospheric deposition, especially of dry deposition, are needed over a wide range of ecosystems; - additional studies of symbiotic fixation are needed that carefully quantify variation over space and time, examine more factors regulating fixation, and focus upon the availability of N and its effects upon productivity and other nutrient cycling processes; - process-level studies of associative N-fixation should be conducted over a range of ecosystems to determine the universal importance of rhizosphere fixation; - further examination of the role of free-living fixation in wood decomposition and soil organic matter genesis is needed, with attention upon spatial and temporal variation; and - investigations of long-term biogeochemical impacts of these inputs must be integrated with process-level studies using modern modelling techniques. 
4151504|Long-term, weekly measurements of streamwater nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the West Fork of Walker Branch, a 1st order forested stream in eastern Tennessee, were used to assess the importance of in-stream processes for controlling stream concentrations and watershed exports. Over the period from 1991 to 2002, there was a slight declining trend in watershed export of dissolved inorganic N via streamflow, despite relatively high and constant wet N deposition rates (5 kg/ha/y). The watershed retains > 90% of N deposition inputs. Concentrations of
41410556|Surface and subsurface litter fulfil many functions in the biogeochemical cycling of C and N in terrestrial ecosystems. These were explored using a microcosm study by monitoring dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (NH-N + NO-N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and fluxes in drainage water under ambient outdoor temperatures. Subsurface litter remarkably reduced the DIN concentrations in winter, probably by microbial N uptake associated with higher C:N ratio of added litter compared with soil at 10-25 cm depth. Fluxes of DIN were generally dominated by NO-N; but NH-N strongly dominated DIN fluxes during freeze-thaw events. Appreciable concentrations of NH-N were observed in the drainage from the acid grassland soils throughout the experiment, indicating NH-N mobility and export in drainage water especially during freeze-thaw. Litter contributed substantially to DOC and DON production and they were correlated positively (p < 0.01) for all treatments. DOC and DON concentrations correlated with temperature for the control (p < 0.01) and surface litter (p < 0.001) treatments and they were higher in late summer. The subsurface litter treatment, however, moderated the effect of temperature on DOC and DON dynamics. Cumulative N species fluxes confirmed the dominance of litter as the source of DON and DOC in the drainage water. DON constituted 42,46 and 62% of cumulative TDN flux for control, surface litter and subsurface litter treatments respectively.
1469001|A new model for simulating nitrogen leaching from forested ecosystems has been applied to data from an experimentally manipulated 30-year-old Sitka spruce stand. The manipulation experiment (at Aber, in north-western Wales, UK) was part of the European NITREX project and involved five years of additions of inorganic nitrogen to the spruce stand. The model (MERLIN) is a catchment-scale, mass-balance model that simulates both biotic and abiotic processes affecting nitrogen in ecosystems. The structure of MERLIN includes representations of the inorganic soil, one plant compartment and two soil organic compartments. Fluxes in and out of the simulated ecosystem and transfers between compartments are regulated by atmospheric deposition, hydrological discharge and biological processes such as plant uptake, litter production, immobilization, mineralization, nitrification and denitrification. Rates of nitrogen uptake, cycling and release among pools are regulated by carbon productivity, inorganic nitrogen availability and the C:N ratios of the organic pools. Inputs to the model are temporal sequences of carbon fluxes and pools, hydrological discharge and external sources of nitrogen. The NITREX experiment at Aber began in 1990 with weekly additions of ammonium nitrate (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) at a rate of 35 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Data were collected from both control and treatment plots within the stand. The site-intensive data from the control plots at Aber were augmented by data taken from a chronosequence of 20 Sitka spruce stands and data from a survey of 5 moorland catchments in the same region to provide calibration data for the model. The data were used to establish current conditions at the Aber site and to reconstruct historical sequences of carbon fluxes and pools from 1900 to the present day with which to drive the model. The reconstructed sequences included an increase in nitrogen deposition and a vegetation change from moorland to plantation forest in 1960. The calibrated model was then used to predict the effects of the experimental nitrogen additions begun in 1990. MERLIN successfully reproduced the observed increase in NO<sub>3</sub> leaching from aging spruce stands that results from forest maturation and increased nitrogen deposition (as inferred from the chronosequence and forest survey data in the region). MERLIN also correctly predicted the increases in soilwater NO<sub>3</sub> concentrations, the changes in nitrogen content of tree and soil organic matter pools, and the changes in nitrogen fluxes that occur in spruce stands in response to increased nitrogen inputs (as observed in the nitrogen addition experiment).
1469582|Bacterial reduction of Fe- and Mn-oxides was studied in a surface horizon of a New-Caledonian Ferralsol in batch experiments. Two treatments were imposed containing different sources of organic matter (soil organic matter with or without glucose addition) to link organic matter biodegradation with reduction process. The concomitant solubilization of Ni and Co was also studied. Results showed that anaerobic Fe- and Mn-reducing bacterial activity was responsible for Fe- and Mn-oxide solubilization by anaerobic respiration or fermentation. When C was more available, oxide reduction was enhanced. Mn-oxide appeared as the major reducible phase and metal source rather than goethite. Co and Ni were solubilized with Fe and Mn but their amounts in solution decreased at the end of experiment. The bioavailability of heavy metals in this soil was increased by biological reduction but was limited by adsorption or precipitation phenomena.
41490461|Rates of organic carbon accumulation and changes in C:N ratio are reported for 10 New Zealand soils converted to pastures from scrub. The data were derived from archive papers originally published in 1964, but which did not report on changes in the C contents of the soils. The soils had been sampled to 0-7.5, 7.5-15, and 15-30 cm depths and chronosequences of up to 66 years obtained by selecting sites with differing times since pasture establishment. We calculated changes in the mass of c and N in the 0-7.5 cm depth and compared that to the mass in the 0-30 cm depth of soil. The shortest time over which organic matter change was assessed was 18 years and the longest was 66 years. Nine of the ten soils showed increases in the C contents of the 0-7.5 cm depth soil, and a natural logarithmic curve generally gave a better fit to the time course data than a linear fit. However, when the full 0-30 cm depth was considered, only two soils showed a significant increase in total C, changes in the C contents of other soils were non-significant, and two soils showed a decline in total C. The rates of change in the C contents were averaged over 0-5 years, 5-25 years and 25-50 years. Across all 10 soils, the mean rates of accumulation of C in the 0-7.5 cm depth were 1.07 (between 0 and 5 years), 0.27 (between 5 and 25 years) and 0.09 Mg C ha year (between 25 and 50 years) and significantly (P < 0.05) greater than zero. Very similar rates were obtained for the 0-30 cm depth of soil with mean rates across all soils 1.01 (0-5 years), 0.25 (5-25 years) and 0.09 Mg ha year (25-50 years), respectively. In the 0-7.5 cm depth of soil, total Kjeldahl N (TKN) increased significantly in seven of the 10 soils. When expressed for the 0-30 cm depth of soil, only five soils still showed significant increases in TKN contents over time. Using the data for the 0-7.5 cm depth, the predicted time (mean and standard error) for the soils to reach a C:N ratio of < 10 was 46  17 years. The soils were originally sampled over 44 years ago, suggesting that currently (2009), very few of them could be expected to have capacity for further N storage in organic matter in the surface soil unless there was an increase in soil C. Changes in soil C and N in the shallow upper soil layers are easily masked by the relatively small changes in C and N contents and much greater masses of soil at lower depths.
1469528| In natural ecosystems, differences often exist in the relative abundance of stable S isotopes ( <sup>34</sup>S) that can provide clues as to the source, nature, and cycling of S. Values of  <sup>34</sup>S in precipitation, throughfall, soils, soil solution, and stream waters were measured at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire. Values of  <sup>34</sup>S in precipitation and throughfall were similar to each other but differed seasonally. Precipitation  <sup>34</sup>S values were higher in the dormant season [ <sup>34</sup>S = 5.90.6 (17)] [Mean+SE(N)] than in the growing season [ <sup>34</sup>S = 5.00.6 (40)] but throughfall growing-season values were higher [ <sup>34</sup>S = 5.60.6 (68)] than for the dormant season [ <sup>34</sup>S = 4.90.7 (9)]. Different tree species did not affect throughfall  <sup>34</sup>S values. In soil solution,  <sup>34</sup>S values were higher in the growing season ( <sup>34</sup>S = 8.92.8; 8.81.7; and 4.00.6 for Oa, Bh, and Bs horizons, respectively) than in the dormant season ( <sup>34</sup>S = 5.61.5; 3.72.4; and 3.41.2 for Oa, Bh, and Bs horizons, respectively). These seasonal differences in  <sup>34</sup>S were probably caused by biological isotopic fractionation. The  <sup>34</sup>S values in streams were generally 2 lower and more variable than those in precipitation and throughfall, suggesting fractionation and/or different isotopic sources in the soil. 
40343606|For soil carbon to be effectively sequestered beyond a timescale of a few decades, this carbon must become incorporated into passive reservoirs or greater depths, yet the actual mechanisms by which this occurs is at best poorly known. In this study, we quantified the magnitude of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching and subsequent retention in soils of a coniferous forest and a coastal prairie ecosystem. Despite small annual losses of DOC relative to respiratory losses, DOC leaching plays a significant role in transporting C from surface horizons and stabilizing it within the mineral soil. We found that DOC movement into the mineral soil constitutes 22% of the annual C inputs below 40 cm in a coniferous forest, whereas only 2% of the C inputs below 20 cm in a prairie soil could be accounted for by this process. In line with these C input estimates, we calculated advective transport velocities of 1.05 and 0.45 mm year for the forested and prairie sites, respectively. Radiocarbon measurements of field-collected DOC interpreted with a basic transport-turnover model indicated that DOC which was transported and subsequently absorbed had a mean residence time of 90-150 years. Given these residence times, the process of DOC movement and retention is responsible for 20% of the total mineral soil C stock to 1 m in the forest soil and 9% in the prairie soil. These results provide quantitative data confirming differences in C cycles in forests and grasslands, and suggest the need for incorporating a better mechanistic understanding of soil C transport, storage and turnover processes into both local and regional C cycle models.
1469451|Methane oxidation associated with submersed vascular plants and its effects on diffusive CH<sub>4</sub> release from plants were examined through a series of laboratory and field incubation experiments. In laboratory analyses, measured rates of epiphytic oxidation (i.e., oxidation associated with aboveground tissues) ranged from 0.3 to 32.9 pmol mm<sup>-2</sup> plant tissue h<sup>-1</sup> with significant CH<sub>4</sub> consumption associated with basal (i.e., near sediment) leaves and stems for all six species tested. Basal stem tissue also showed greater oxidation activity than basal leaves. Oxidation activity for washed roots of three submersed species ranged from 0.18 to 7.01  mol g<sup>-1</sup> root ash-free dry mass h<sup>-1</sup> with higher rates associated with two rhizomatous/stoloniferous species than with a non-rhizomatous one. In field incubations of a single species (Myriophyllum exalbescens), intact plants showed net CH<sub>4</sub> consumption during the day and net release at night. When a specific inhibitor of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation was applied (methyl fluoride - MF), net daytime release from plants was observed and nighttime flux increased, indicating that diffusive CH<sub>4</sub> release from submersed plants is significantly curtailed by the activity of epiphytic methanotrophs.
1469204|We investigated the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and soil nutrient availability during growth on the subsequent decomposition and nitrogen (N) release from litter of four annual grasses that differ in resource requirements and native habitat. Vulpia microstachys is a native grass found on California serpentine soils, whereas Avena fatua, Bromus hordaceus, and Lolium multiflorum are introduced grasses restricted to more fertile sandstone soils (Hobbs & Mooney 1991). Growth in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> altered litter C:N ratio, decomposition, and N release, but the direction and magnitude of the changes differed among plant species and nutrient treatments. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> had relatively modest effects on C:N ratio of litter, increasing this ratio in Lolium roots (and shoots at high nutrients), but decreasing C:N ratio in Avena shoots. Growth of plants under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> decreased the decomposition rate of Vulpia litter, but increased decomposition of Avena litter from the high-nutrient treatment. The impact of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on N loss from litter also differed among species, with Vulpia litter from high-CO<sub>2</sub> plants releasing N more slowly than ambient-CO<sub>2</sub> litter, whereas growth under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> caused increased N loss from Avena litter. CO<sub>2</sub> effects on N release in Lolium and Bromus depended on the nutrient regime in which plants were grown. There was no overall relationship between litter C:N ratio and decomposition rate or N release across species and treatments. Based on our study and the literature, we conclude that the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on decomposition and N release from litter are highly species-specific. These results do not support the hypothesis that CO<sub>2</sub> effects on litter quality consistently lead to decreased nutrient availability in nutrient-limited ecosystems exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.
25652616|In mountain regions of Central Europe an increase of soil frost periods is predicted for this century due to reduced snow fall. To investigate the effects of freezing and thawing on soil NO fluxes in a mature Norway spruce forest in the mountainous Fichtelgebirge, Germany, the natural snow cover on three experimental plots was removed to induce soil frost. Three plots with natural snow cover served as controls. Soil NO fluxes were recorded in biweekly to monthly intervals during the frost and subsequent thawing period of the below-average cold winter in 2005/2006 and in the above-average warm winter in 2006/2007. In addition, NO concentrations and isotope signatures in soil air were measured along soil profiles in six different depths (from 6 to 70 cm). The soil of the snow removal plots was frozen down to 15 cm depth from January to April 2006 while the soil of control plots remained unfrozen under snow cover. Both soil freezing and thawing resulted in almost tenfold enhanced NO fluxes on snow removal plots contributing 84% to annual NO emissions. In the subsequent winter without soil frost no effects were observed. Vertical gradients of NO concentrations together with isotope abundance suggest that the subsoil of all plots was a probably weak, but continous NO source throughout the year. Isotope signatures and NO concentration gradients in the soil profile indicate that microbial NO production and reduction of NO to N did not or just marginally occur in frozen soil layers of the snow removal plots. Consequently, elevated NO fluxes in the late winter were attributed to the release of accumulated NO originating from the subsoil. At unfrozen soil, however, NO emissions were reduced due to a shift of the NO production-consumption ratio towards more consumption in the topsoil of both the control and snow removal plots. These findings contradict the general assumption that NO production in the organic layer is responsible for bursts of NO due to soil frost.
24716781|There is increasing evidence that forests and forest soil contribute to the signature of chlorine composition in water bodies. However, little is known about the potential effects of land management activities on chlorine biogeochemistry. This study examines the effects of previous nitrogen addition on chlorine chemistry in a Pinus sylvestris L. forest located in south-central Sweden (6000N, 1343E). Repeated addition of nitrogen to study plots over a 20-year period resulted in total additions of 0, 450 and 900 kg N ha. Soil samples were collected before harvesting, and soil solution and biomass were sampled following final felling. Contrary to previous findings, we found no clear evidence that previous addition of nitrogen had hampered the formation of organic chlorine in the organic soil layer. We suggest that the effects of nitrogen addition on chlorination processes are not seen in the surface soil, but are instead manifested in the migration of organic matter in the mineral soil. Soil organic matter from the E-horizon had a lower chlorination degree in the nitrogen-amended plots than in the control plots. In addition, we observed lower Cl levels in the seedling needles following high nitrogen fertilization (900 N) than in 450 N or control. These results add on the importance of studying chlorine dynamics with focus on what chlorinated soil organic matter can be resistant to degradation compared to average soil organic matter and what can be leached as a result of harvesting and available for vegetation.
1469217|Cultivation of previously untilled soils usually results in release of carbon from the soil to the atmosphere, which can affect both soil fertility locally and the atmospheric burden of CO<sub>2</sub> globally. Generalizations about the magnitude of this flux have been hampered by a lack of good quality comparative data on soil carbon stocks of cultivated and uncultivated soils. Using data from several recent studies, we have reexamined the conclusions of previous reviews of this subject. The data were divided into subsets according to whether the soils were sampled by genetic horizon or by fixed depths. Sampling by fixed depths appears to underestimate soil C losses, but both subsets of data support earlier conclusions that between 20% and 40% of the soil C is lost following cultivation. Our best estimate is a loss of about 30% from the entire soil solum. Our analysis also supports the conclusion that most of the loss of soil C occurs within the first few years (even within two years in some cases) following initial cultivation. Our analysis does not support an earlier conclusion that the fractional loss of soil carbon is positively correlated to the amount of carbon initially present in the uncultivated soil. We found no relation between carbon content of uncultivated soil and the percentage lost following cultivation.
20519863|Human activities have greatly increased the input of biologically available nitrogen (N) from land-based sources to aquatic ecosystems; yet few studies have examined how human actions influence N export in regions with a strong seasonality in water availability. In this study, we quantified N inputs and outputs for 23 California watersheds and examined how climate, hydrology, and land use practices influenced watershed N export. N inputs ranged from 581 to 11,234 kg N km year among watersheds, with 80% of total input for the region originating from agriculture (inorganic fertilizer, manure, and legumes). Of the potential N sources examined, mean annual concentrations of dissolved organic N and dissolved inorganic N in study rivers correlated most strongly with manure N input (r = 0.54 and 0.53, respectively). Seasonal N export varied by basin and was correlated with climate, anthropogenic N inputs, and reservoir releases. Fractional export of watershed N inputs by study rivers annually was small (median of 8%) and scaled exponentially with runoff (r = 0.66). Collectively, our results show that anthropogenic activities have altered both the magnitude and timing of watershed N export in California and suggest that targeted management in specific locations and times of the year could reduce N export to downstream systems in the region.
1469846|This study documented linkages between lakeshore seepage fluxes, pore water chemistry, and aquatic plants in several lakes of the Adirondack Mountains region of New York, USA. Three replicate stations were set up along each of four different lake shorelines. From June through September 1998 and from snowmelt in April through August 1999, seepage flux was measured with seepage meters. Throughout this time period, lake surface water and pore water chemistry were monitored weekly to biweekly. At each station, leaf tissue chemistry of the water lily Nuphar variegatum was measured once in each year. Sediment chemistry and plant abundance were also measured once in 1998. We found that pore water concentrations of base cations, iron, and zinc were related to the direction, magnitude, and variability of seepage fluxes. Concentrations of base cations, iron, and zinc were both highest and most variable where seepage was low (0 to 50 mL m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) in contrast to being more stable where seepage was highest and variable (-608 to 612 mL m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Leaf tissue chemistry and plant abundance were also related to seepage patterns. N. variegatum leaves had elevated zinc content at stations with low average discharge. Knowledge of seepage patterns helped to explain spatial patterns of elevated trace metal content in both pore water and plant tissues. Our work suggests that the hydrological process of lakeshore seepage exerts important controls on lakeshore biogeochemistry.
20456578|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) contributes to organic carbon either stored in mineral soil horizons or exported to the hydrosphere. However, the main controls of DOM dynamics are still under debate. We studied fresh leaf litter and more decomposed organic material as the main sources of DOM exported from the forest floor of a mixed beech/oak forest in Germany. In the field we doubled and excluded aboveground litter input and doubled the input of throughfall. From 1999 to 2005 we measured concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic C and N (DOC, DON) beneath the Oi and Oe/Oa horizon. DOM composition was traced by UV and fluorescence spectroscopy. In selected DOM samples we analyzed the concentrations of phenols, pentoses and hexoses, and lignin-derived phenols by CuO oxidation. DOC and DON concentrations and fluxes almost doubled instantaneously in both horizons of the forest floor by doubling the litter input and DOC concentrations averaged 82 mg C l in the Oe/Oa horizon. Properties of DOM did not suggest a change of the main DOM source towards fresh litter. In turn, increasing ratios of hexoses to pentoses and a larger content of lignin-derived phenols in the Oe/Oa horizon of the Double litter plots in comparison to the Control plots indicated a priming effect: Addition of fresh litter stimulated microbial activity resulting in increased microbial production of DOM from organic material already stored in Oe/Oa horizons. Exclusion of litter input resulted in an immediate decrease in DOC concentrations and fluxes in the thin Oi horizon. In the Oe/Oa horizon DOC concentrations started to decline in the third year and were significantly smaller than those in the Control after 5 years. Properties of DOM indicated an increased proportion of microbially and throughfall derived compounds after exclusion of litter inputs. Dissolved organic N did not decrease upon litter exclusion. We assume a microbial transformation of mineral N from throughfall and N mineralization to DON. Increased amounts of throughfall resulted in almost equivalently increased DOC fluxes in the Oe/Oa horizon. However, long-term additional throughfall inputs resulted in significantly declining DOC concentrations over time. We conclude that DOM leaving the forest floor derives mainly from decomposed organic material stored in Oe/Oa horizons. Leaching of organic matter from fresh litter is of less importance. Observed effects of litter manipulations strongly depend on time and the stocks of organic matter in forest floor horizons. Long-term experiments are particularly necessary in soils/horizons with large stocks of organic matter and in studies focusing on effects of declined substrate availability. The expected increased primary production upon climate change with subsequently enhanced litter input may result in an increased production of DOM from organic soil horizons.
1468712| The isotope exchange between <sup>35</sup>S-labeled sulfur compounds of sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), elemental sulfur (S<sup>0</sup>), polysulfide (S<sub>n</sub><sup>2-</sup>), hydrogen sulfide ( HS<sup>-</sup>: H<sub>2</sub>S+HS<sup>-</sup>+S<sup>2-</sup>), iron sulfide (FeS), and pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) was studied at pH 7.6 and 20C in anoxic, sterile seawater. Isotope exchange was observed between S<sup>0</sup>, S<sub>n</sub><sup>2-</sup>,  HS<sup>-</sup>, and FeS, but not between <sup>35</sup>S labeled SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> or FeS<sub>2</sub> and the other sulfur compounds. Polysulfide mediated the isotope exchange between S<sup>0</sup> and bisulfide (HS<sup>-</sup>). The isotope exchange between S<sup>0</sup> and S<sub>n</sub><sup>2-</sup> reached 50% of equilibrium within < 2 min while exchange between S<sub>n</sub><sup>2-</sup> and HS<sup>-</sup> approached equilibrium within 0.5-1 h. In all the experiments  HS<sup>-</sup> revealed a fraction exchange from 0.79 to 1.00. Isotope exchange between S<sup>0</sup> and FeS took place only via S<sub>n</sub><sup>2-</sup> and/or HS<sup>-</sup>. The isotope exchange between iron sulfide and the other sulfur compounds was not complete within 24 h as shown by a fraction exchange of 0.07-0.83. This lack of equilibrium (fraction exchange < 1) was due to the isotope exchange between dissolved compounds and surfaces of sulfur particles. The isotopic exchange reactions limit the usefulness of radiotracers in process studies of the inorganic sulfur species. Exchange reactions will also affect the stable isotope distribution among the sulfur species. The kinetics of the isotopic exchange reactions, however, depend on both pH and temperature. 
23359764|Rapid rainfall events can be responsible for a large proportion of annual nutrient and carbon loading from a watershed. The bioavailability of organic matter during these rapid loading events increases, suggesting that storms play a relevant role in the mobilization of potentially labile terrestrial carbon. A high correlation between river discharge rates and dissolved and particulate nutrient and carbon concentrations during autumn and winter storms was observed in several temperate Pacific Northwest rivers. Dissolved and particulate lignin concentrations also increased with river discharge; for example, in October 2009 dissolved lignin concentrations increased roughly 240% with a 200% increase in river discharge. During these storms a unique phenolic composition was observed for dissolved lignin that was rapidly mobilized from surface soils relative to the base flow of dissolved lignin. The observed increase in Ad/Al ratios with discharge indicates that rapidly mobilized dissolved lignin is more degraded than the base flow of dissolved lignin. Similarly, a marked increase in C/V ratios and decrease in the S/V ratio of dissolved lignin phenols with increasing river discharge was observed. These results may indicate a difference in source between mobilized and base flow pools, or, more likely, preferential degradation and mobilization/retention of specific lignin phenols. The cumulative results from this year-long data set indicate that a shallow nutrient-rich pool of particulate and dissolved organic matter accumulates in watersheds during periods of soil-saturation deficiency (summer). Autumn and winter storms mobilize this pool of accumulated nutrients from surface soils, which is exhausted with successive winter storms.
20456385|Understanding the effects of climate change including precipitation patterns has important implications for evaluating the biogeochemical responses of watersheds. We focused on four storms in late summer and early fall that occurred after an exceptionally dry period in 2002. We analyzed not only the influence of these storms on episodic chemistry and the role of different water sources in affecting surface water chemistry, but also the relative contributions of these storms to annual biogeochemical mass balances. The study site was a well studied 135-ha watershed in the Adirondack Park of New York State (USA). Our analyses integrated measurements on hydrology, solute chemistry and the isotopic composition of
1469816|Methyl bromide (CH<sub>3</sub>Br) and methyl chloride (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl) emission rates from southern California coastal salt marshes show large spatial and temporal variabilities that are strongly linked to biological and environmental factors. Here we discuss biogeochemical lines of evidence pointing to vegetation as the primary source of CH<sub>3</sub>Br and CH<sub>3</sub>Cl emissions from salt marshes. Sediments and macroalgae do not appear to be major producers of these compounds, based on observations that the highest fluxes are not inhibited by soil inundation; their emissions are not correlated with those of certain gases produced in soils; and emissions from mudflat- and macroalgae-dominated sites are relatively small. In contrast, the seasonal and spatial variabilities of methyl halide fluxes in these salt marshes are consistent with the production of these compounds by vascular plants, although the possibility of production by microflora or fungi associated with the salt marsh vegetation is not ruled out. Flux chamber measurements of emission rates are largely correlated to the overall plant biomass enclosed in the chamber, but appear also to be highly dependent on the predominant plant species. Emission rates follow a diurnal trend similar to the trends of ambient air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, but not surface soil temperature. Diurnal variabilities in the carbon isotope compositions of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and CH<sub>3</sub>Br and their relative ratios of emissions are consistent with simultaneously competing mechanisms of uptake and production.
1469720| An understanding of the mechanisms controlling nutrient availability and retention in and across ecosystems allows for a greater understanding of the role of nutrients in maintaining ecosystem structure and function. To examine the underlying mechanisms of phosphorus (P) cycling in northern peatlands, we compared the retention and movement of P across a natural hydrologic/pH gradient in nine peatlands by applying as a light rain an in situ tracer amount of <sup>32</sup>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-3</sup> to track changes in P pools (vegetation, soil, microbial) over 30 days. The <sup>31</sup>P concentrations of available P, microbial P, and the root P at 10-20 cm did not differ across the gradient, although total soil P and aboveground vegetation P content (g m<sup>-2</sup>) increased from bog to rich fen. Total retention of <sup>32</sup>P in the first 24 hours of application was greatest in the bogs and intermediate fens (90-100%) and was very low (20-50%) in the rich fens. Retention of P in the different pools was dependent on the type of peatland and changed with time. In the first 24 hours in the bogs and intermediate fens, the microbial pool contained the largest amount of <sup>32</sup>P, but by the seventh day, the aboveground vegetation contained the largest amount. In the rich fen, the recovered <sup>32</sup>P was almost equally divided between the aboveground vegetation and the litter layer with very little in other pools. Therefore, although bogs and intermediate fens have a small total P pool, they have similar P availability to rich fens because of rapid cycling and efficient retention of P. 
1469050|Ferruginous crusts and pisolites have chemical and mineralogical properties that differ from the surrounding soil due to Fe and Al enrichments which cause cementations that can harden irreversibly. In addition to, and possibly as a result of the Fe and Al accumulation, other ions, particularly phosphate are often also enriched by a factor of 2-20 relative to the surrounding soil. The P accumulated in ferruginous materials is normally bound to the Fe or Al in amorphous forms of low solubility. Distinct minerals have rarely been identified. We examined a section through a Venezuelan ferruginous crust, which contained portions with P contents >100 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, chemically, mineralogically and micromorphologically with the aim to show some of the mechanisms that cause such extreme P accumulation and segregation in a landscape that is otherwise very nutrient poor. Except for the cementation, manifested as an in-filling of pores by Fe, the morphology of the ferruginous crusts reflected that of the original soil. At approx. 30 cm below the crust's surface, goethite, strengite and leucophosphite (KFe<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>OH 2H<sub>2</sub>O) were identified along a downward sequence of pores nearer the surface to pores at greater depth to the matrix of the lower crust. While the lower crust contained highly soluble P, Fe oxides from outer pore spaces showed high P sorption. The element and mineral distribution across thin sections suggested that incoming Fe had interacted with a soil matrix that was exceptionally rich in K and P to form highly soluble leucophosphite, followed by less soluble strengite and finally Fe oxides that essentially occluded the more soluble minerals found in the lower crust. Associated organic C dated at 18,700 y b.p., suggesting that the occlusion process occurred around the last glacial maximum, when the region became more arid. Although extreme in its extent, the process of separation and occlusion of minerals demonstrated here, may be useful for interpreting similar processes in soils and soil cementations that affect the biogeochemical turnover of elements.
23359730|The effect of moorland management on the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from blanket peat is currently a topic of great interest in the UK. A recent paper by Chapman et al. (Biogeochemistry, doi:10.1007/s10533-010-9474-x, 2010) reports on changes in humic colour/DOC concentrations in surface waters draining 15 upland peat catchments in the North Pennines (UK) over two decades, and examines the possible underlying drivers of those changes. Chapman et al. identify significant variation in water colour between adjacent catchments and over time. One potential driver of changes in DOC is managed moorland burning, and Chapman et al. state that their study provides evidence that burning has no effect on colour in upland catchment drainage waters. This observation counters a recent series of papers showing strong links between new moorland burn management on blanket peat soils and colour/DOC in catchment drainage waters. We have reviewed the methodological approach and results presented by Chapman et al. that relate to the assessment of managed burning, and show significant errors in the data used in their analysis. This has resulted in conclusions being drawn about the role of managed burning in DOC release that are not supported by evidence.
40343516|Green alder (Alnus viridis ssp. fruticosa) is a dominant understory shrub during secondary successional development of upland forests throughout interior Alaska, where it contributes substantially to the nitrogen (N) economy through atmospheric N fixation. Across a replicated 200+ year old vegetation chronosequence, we tested the hypotheses that green alder has strong effects on soil chemical properties, and that ecosystem-level N inputs via N fixation decrease with secondary successional stand development. Across early-, mid-, and late-successional stands, alder created islands of elevated soil N and carbon (C), depleted soil phosphorus (P), and more acidic soils. These effects translated to the stand-level in response to alder stem density. Although neither N fixation nor nodule biomass differed among stand types, increases in alder densities with successional time translated to increasing N inputs. Estimates of annual N inputs by A. viridis averaged across the upland chronosequence (6.6  1.2 kg N ha1 year1) are substantially less than inputs during early succession by Alnus tenuifolia growing along Alaskan floodplains. However, latesuccession upland forests, where densities of A. viridis are highest, may persist for centuries, depending on fire return interval. This pattern of prolonged N inputs to late successional forests contradicts established theory predicting declines in N-fixation rates and N-fixer abundance as stands age.
20519771|Soil organic matter (OM) can be stabilized against decomposition by association with minerals, by its inherent recalcitrance and by occlusion in aggregates. However, the relative contribution of these factors to OM stabilization is yet unknown. We analyzed pool size and isotopic composition (C, C) of mineral-protected and recalcitrant OM in 12 subsurface horizons from 10 acidic forest soils. The results were related to properties of the mineral phase and to OM composition as revealed by CPMAS C-NMR and CuO oxidation. Stable OM was defined as that material which survived treatment of soils with 6 wt% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Mineral-protected OM was extracted by subsequent dissolution of minerals by 10% hydrofluoric acid (HF). Organic matter resistant against NaOCl and insoluble in HF was considered as recalcitrant OM. Hypochlorite removed primarily C-modern OM. Of the stable organic carbon (OC), amounting to 2.4-20.6 g kg soil, mineral dissolution released on average 73%. Poorly crystalline Fe and Al phases
1469082| Nitrogen dynamics of a plains reach of the South Platte River were studied over a 12-month cycle for the purpose of quantifying denitrification rates. The working hypothesis of the study was that denitrification would be of extraordinary importance in the system because of large amounts of water exchange between the channel and an extensive subsurface alluvium consisting of gravel. Denitrification losses of nitrate were quantified through the use of a mass-balance model based on detailed hydrologic information and field quantification of the rates of nitrate accrual through surface and subsurface input of water as well as nitrification. Denitrification rates ranged between 2 and 100 mg N/m<sup>2</sup>/hr. Distance required to achieve 90% reduction of nitrate was as short as 6 km during mid-summer and as long as 300 km during mid-winter. On an annual basis, close to half of nitrate input to a 100-km reach was removed by denitrification (3.6  10<sup>6</sup> kg/yr). Rates of nitrate loss to denitrification (annual mean, 28 mg N/m<sup>2</sup>/h) and overall percent removal of nitrate by denitrification were approximately 10 times as high as rates documented for rivers in the eastern U.S. The study shows that high rates of hyporheic exchange can support extraordinary rates of denitrification. 
1469207|The effects of tidal restrictions by diking on salt marsh biogeochemistry were interpreted by comparing the hydrology, porewater chemistry and solid phase composition of both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes with adjacent natural salt marshes on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Flooding periods were greatest in natural and least in drained marshes. Differences between the chemistry of the natural and diked marshes depended upon the depth of the water table and the supply of sulfate for anaerobic metabolism. Drained marsh sediments were highly acidic (pH <4) with porewaters rich in dissolved Fe; the natural and diked flooded marshes had pH 6-7.5 and Fe orders of magnitude lower. Porewater nutrients, sulfides and alkalinity were much lower in both flooded and drained diked marshes than in the natural marsh. Sediments of the drained marsh had subsided 90 cm relative to the natural site due to organic matter decomposition and compaction. However, despite the loss of organic matter, much of the P and N was retained, with NH<sub>4</sub> likely protected from nitrification by low pH and PO<sub>4</sub> adsorbed on Fe and Al oxides. Iron, and to a lesser degree sulfur, had also been well retained by the sediment. Despite eight decades of diking, substantial amounts of reduced S, representing potential acidity, persisted near the top of the water table. In contrast, the surface of the seasonally flooded marsh was only 15 cm below the natural marsh. Accretion since diking amounted to 25 cm and involved proportionally less mineral matter. The restoration of seawater flow to both seasonally flooded and drained diked marshes will likely extend flooding depth and duration, lower redox, increase cation exchange, and thereby increase NH<sub>4</sub>, Fe(II), and PO<sub>4</sub> mobilization. Increased porewater nutrients could benefit recolonizing halophytes but may also degrade surface water quality.
41410582|Understanding the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in potential watershed sources is critical for explaining and quantifying the exports of DOM in stream runoff. Here, we examined the concentration and quality of DOM for ten watershed sources in a 12 ha forested catchment over a two-year period. DOM composition was evaluated for: throughfall, litter leachate, soil water (zero and tension), shallow and deep groundwater, stream water, hyporheic zone, and groundwater seeps. DOM quality was measured using a suite of optical indices including UV-visible absorbance and PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitationemission matrices (EEMs). DOM concentrations and quality displayed a pronounced trend across watershed sources. Surficial watershed sources had higher DOM concentrations and more humic-like DOM with higher molecular weight whereas deeper groundwater sources were rich in % protein-like fluorescence. The greater % contribution of protein-like fluorescence in groundwater suggested that a larger fraction of groundwater DOM may be bioavailable. DOM for wetland groundwater was more aromatic and humic-like than that at the well-drained riparian location. Principal component analyses (PCA) revealed that the differences in surficial watershed compartments were dictated by humic-like components while groundwater sources separated out by % protein-like fluorescence. Observations from optical indices did not provide any conclusive evidence for preferential association of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) with any particular DOM quality pools.
20456438|The export of carbon through the biological pump from the surface to the deep ocean has a direct influence on the removal of CO from the atmosphere. This is because the carbon is sequestered for only a few days to months in the surface while the carbon removed from the surface to deep waters takes hundreds of years to re-enter the atmosphere. The highest dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is expected in the deep waters of the North Pacific due to longer age of waters. On contrary, the higher deep water DIC is found in the northern Indian Ocean than elsewhere in the World Oceans. The sinking fluxes of particulate organic (POC) and inorganic carbon (CaCO) are found to be the highest in the northern Indian Ocean. The rates of bacterial respiration, organic carbon regeneration and inorganic carbon dissolution are also found to be the highest in the northern Indian Ocean than elsewhere. A most efficient biological pump appears to be operating in the northern Indian Ocean that transports surface-derived organic/inorganic carbon to deeper layers where it is converted and stored for longer times in dissolved inorganic form.
1468727|The pore-water geochemistry and benthic foraminiferal assemblages of sediments from two slope sites and within the central portion of the Santa Barbara Basin were characterized between February 1988 and July 1989. The highest foraminiferal numerical densities (1197 cm<sup>-3</sup> as determined by an ATP assay) occurred at a slope site in June 1988 (550 m) in partially laminated sediments. In continuously laminated sediments from the central basin, foraminifera were found living (as determined by ATP assay) in October 1988 to depths of 4 cm, and specimens prepared for transmission electron microscopy were found with intact organelles to 3 cm, indicating their inhabitation of anoxic pore waters. Ultrastructural data from Nonionella stella is consistent with the hypothesis that this species can survive by anaerobic respiration. However, the benthic foraminifera appear unable to survive prolonged anoxia. The benthic foraminiferal population was completely dead in July 1989 when bottom water O<sub>2</sub> was undetectable.
1468800|The elemental content of rainfall (bulk deposition), throughfall and stemflow was measured in Pinus radiata D. Don and Eucalyptus forests in Gippsland, Victoria. Accessions in rainfall (mg m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) averaged: organic-C 551, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N 96, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N 62, total-N 303, K<sup>+</sup> 382, Na<sup>+</sup> 2250, Ca<sup>2+</sup> 1170, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> 678. The mean pH of rainfall was 5.9. Concentrations of all elements were greater in throughfall than in rainfall, and generally greater in stemflow than in throughfall. However, pH of pine throughfall was higher than that of rainfall, and pH of eucalypt throughfall was lower than that of rainfall. There was a net efflux of inorganic-N from pine crowns to rainfall, whilst in eucalypts there was generally net sorption of inorganic-N from rainfall. In both species organic-N was leached from the crowns and the net efflux of total-N from eucalypt crowns (50 mg m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) averaged one-quarter of that in pines. Increases in the organic-C content of throughfall relative to rainfall in eucalypts were two to four times those in pines. Increases in the content of other elements in throughfall were comparable in pines and eucalypts and within the ranges K<sup>+</sup> 615-1360, Na<sup>+</sup> 480-1840, Ca<sup>2+</sup> 123-780 and Mg<sup>2+</sup> 253-993 mg m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>. However, enrichment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> may have been due to dust trapped in the canopies. Stemflow contributed significantly to the total amounts of elements reaching the forest floor in water.
41490462|The multi-faceted nature of anthropogenic climate change means that policy analysis must draw on a very wide range of disciplines. In combining information from a variety of sources, it is important to ensure consistency across the interfaces. This paper draws on some historical cases from carbon cycle studies in order to illustrate the type of issue involved. These are used as background for presenting current issues that arise in analysing changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and the specification of emissions that cause these changes. Implications for consistent analysis of consequent climate changes are noted.
41410568|Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is an abundant organic sulfur compound in marine algae and denitrification influences nitrogen availability to primary producers, the key regulators of coastal eutrophication. In this study, we tested the effect of DMSP on the nitrous oxide (NO) reduction step of denitrification in sediments and biofilms from the Douro and Ave estuaries (NW Portugal) and in pure cultures of a denitrifying bacterium, Ruegeria pomeroyi. NO accumulation rates were monitored in sediment slurries and bacterial cell suspensions amended with DMSP concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mM. In these treatments NO accumulation rates increased linearly with DMSP concentration (R from 0.89 to 0.99, p < 0.001), suggesting an inhibitory effect of DMSP on the nitrous oxide reducase activity. The addition of DMSP to sediments and bacterial culture resulted in accumulation of dimethylsulfide (DMS) as well as NO. However, no direct inhibition on NO reducase activity by DMS was observed. Natural concentrations of DMSP in the different estuarine sites were found to be linearly correlated to natural NO effluxes (R = 0.64, p < 0.001), suggesting that DMSP may negatively affect NO reducase in situ. This newly identified ineracion between DMSP and NO emissions may have a significani ecological role as the inhibition of the nitrous oxide reduction enhances nitrogen loss via NO. Since NO is a powerful greenhouse gas, the results from our study may be important for evaluating climate change scenarios. concentration (R from 0.89 to 0.99, p < 0.001), suggesting an inhibitory effect of DMSP on the nitrous oxide reducase activity.

24715360|Seasonally flooded, freshwater cypress-tupelo wetlands, dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium distictum), water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica), and swamp tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora) are commonly found in coastal regions of the southeastern United States. These wetlands are threatened due to climate change, sea level rise, and coastal urban development. Understanding the natural biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in these forested wetlands as ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and nitrogen processing can provide important benchmarks to guide conservation plans and restoration goals. In this study, surface water and soil pore water samples were collected weekly from a cypress-tupelo wetland near Winyah Bay, South Carolina and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen, and phosphate during its flooding period between October 2010 and May 2011. DOC was further characterized by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio (SR) (ratio of two spectral slopes between 275295 nm and 350400 nm), E2/E3 ratio (ratio between A254 and A365), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. In addition, litterfall was collected on a monthly basis for a year while the biomass of the detritus layer (i.e., decomposed duff lying on the wetland floor) was determined before and after the flooding period. Results of the field study showed that concentrations of DOC, DON, NHN, and (NO + NO)N in the surface water were generally higher during the fall, or peak litterfall season (October to December), than in the spring season (March to May). Highest concentrations of 54.8, 1.48, 0.270, and 0.0205 mg L, for DOC, DON, NHN, and (NO + NO)N respectively, in surface waters were recorded during October. Lower SUVA, but higher SR and E2/E3 ratios of DOC, were observed at the end of the flooding season comparing to the initial flooding, suggesting the wetland system converts high aromatic and large DOC molecules into smaller and hydrophilic fractions possibly through photochemical oxidation. A similar trend was observed in soil pore water, but the pore water generally had greater and relatively stable concentrations of dissolved nutrients than surface water. No obvious temporal trend in phosphate concentration and total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N:P) were found. Results of the laboratory extraction and mass balance calculation suggested fresh litter was a major source of DOC whereas decomposed duff was the source of dissolved nitrogen in surface water. In summary, the biogeochemistry of this isolated cypress-tupelo wetland is not only driven by the vegetation within the wetland system but also by hydrology and weather conditions such as groundwater table position, precipitation, and temperature.
20519837|Plant allocation patterns may affect soil C and N storage due to differences in litter quality and the depth of plant C and N inputs into the soil. We studied the dynamics of dual-labeled (C/N) Pinus ponderosa needles and fine roots placed at two soil depths (O and A horizon) in a temperate conifer forest soil during 2 y. Input of C as fine roots resulted in much more C retained in soil (70.5  2.2% of applied) compared with needle C (42.9  1.3% of applied) after 1.5 y. Needles showed faster mass loss, rates of soil CO efflux, and more N immobilized into microbial biomass than did fine roots. The larger proportion of labile C compounds initially present in needles (17% more needle C was water soluble than in fine roots) likely contributed to its shorter C residence time and greater degree of transformation in the soil. A double exponential decay function best described the rate of C loss, with a smaller initial pulse of C loss from fine roots (Sk) and a slower decay rate of the recalcitrant C pool for fine roots (0.03 y) compared with (0.19 y) for needles. Soil C respiration, representing heterotrophic respiration of litter C, was much more seasonal from the O horizon than from the A. However, offsetting seasonal patterns in C dynamics in the O horizon resulted in no net effect of soil depth on total C retention in the soil after 1.5 y for either litter. Almost 90% of applied litter N was retained in the soil after 1.5 y, independent of litter quality or soil depth. Very small amounts of C or N (&lt; 3% of applied) moved to the horizon above or below the placement depth (i.e., O to A or A to O). Our results suggest that plant allocation belowground to fine roots results in more C retained and less N mineralized compared with allocation aboveground to needles, primarily due to litter quality differences.
4151494|The hydrogeology between the catchment area and the divided dystrophic Lake Fuchskuhle with respect to the genesis and the land-water interactions were investigated. Water levels at numerous locations in the catchment area were measured in order to characterize the hydrology. The water balance of the area was calculated based on long term climatic investigations. The geology of the peat was documented at 25 sampling points by cores collected with a peat drill.

20456432|Phosphorus (P) binding groups were identified in phytoplankton, settling particles, and sediment profiles by P NMR spectroscopy from the Swedish mesotrophic Lake Erken. The P NMR analysis revealed that polyphosphates and pyrophosphates were abundant in the water column, but rapidly mineralized in the sediment. Orthophosphate monoesters and teichoic acids degraded more slowly than DNA-P, polyphosphates, and P lipids. Humic acids and organic acids from phytoplankton were precipitated from the NaOH extract by acidification and identified by P NMR spectroscopy. The precipitated P was significantly more recalcitrant than the P compound groups remaining in solution, but does not constitute a major sink of P as it did not reach a stable concentration with depth, which indicates that it may eventually be degraded. Since P also precipitated from phytoplankton, the origin of humic-P can not be related solely to allochthonous P.
24715363|Tropical montane forests are commonly limited by N or co-limited by N and P. Projected increases in N deposition in tropical montane regions are thought to be insufficient for vegetation demand and are not therefore expected to affect soil N availability and NO emissions. We established a factorial N- and P-addition experiment (i.e., N, P, N + P, and control) across an elevation gradient of montane forests in Ecuador to test these hypotheses: (1) moderate rates of N and P additions are able to stimulate soil-N cycling rates and NO fluxes, and (2) the magnitude and timing of soil NO-flux responses depend on the initial nutrient status of the forest soils. Moderate rates of nutrients were added: 50 kg N ha year (in the form of urea) and 10 kg P ha year (in the form of NaHPO2HO) split in two equal applications. We tested the hypotheses by measuring changes in net rates of soilN cycling and NO fluxes during the first 2 years (20082009) of nutrient manipulation in an old-growth premontane forest at 1,000 m, growing on a Cambisol soil with no organic layer, in an old-growth lower montane forest at 2,000 m, growing on a Cambisol soil with an organic layer, and an old-growth upper montane rainforest at 3,000 m, growing on a Histosol soil with a thick organic layer. Among the control plots, net nitrification rates were largest at the 1,000-m site whereas net nitrification was not detectable at the 2,000- and 3,000-m sites. The already large net nitrification at the 1,000-m site was not affected by nutrient additions, but net nitrification became detectable at the 2,000- and 3000-m sites after the second year of N and N + P additions. NO emissions increased rapidly following N and N + P additions at the 1,000-m site whereas only smaller increases occurred at the 2,000- and 3,000-m sites during the second year of N and N + P additions. Addition of P alone had no effect on net rates of soil N cycling and NO fluxes at any elevation. Our results showed that the initial soil N status, which may also be influenced by presence or absence of organic layer, soil moisture and temperature as encompassed by the elevation gradient, is a good indicator of how soil N cycling and NO fluxes may respond to future increases in nutrient additions.
1469187|Flooding can be an important control of nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry in wetland ecosystems. In North American prairie marshes, spring flooding is a dominant feature of the physical environment that increases emergent plant production and could influence N cycling. I investigated how spring flooding affects N availability and plant N utilization in whitetop (Scolochloa festucacea) marshes in Manitoba, Canada by comparing experimentally spring-flooded marsh inside an impoundment with adjacent nonflooded marsh. The spring-flooded marsh had net N mineralization rates up to 4 times greater than nonflooded marsh. Total growing season net N mineralization was 124 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> in the spring-flooded marsh compared with 62 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> in the nonflooded marsh. Summer water level drawdown in the spring-flooded marsh decreased net N mineralization rates. Net nitrification rates increased in the nonflooded marsh following a lowering of the water table during mid summer. Growing season net nitrification was 33 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> in the nonflooded marsh but <latex>$<1\ \text{kg N ha}^{-1}$</latex> in the spring-flooded marsh. Added NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> induced nitrate reductase (NRA) activity in whitetop grown in pot culture. Field-collected plants showed higher NRA in the nonflooded marsh. Nitrate comprised 40% of total plant N uptake in the nonflooded marsh but <1% of total N uptake in the spring-flooded marsh. Higher plant N demand caused by higher whitetop production in the spring-flooded marsh approximately balanced greater net N mineralization. A close association between the presence of spring flooding and net N mineralization and net nitrification rates indicated that modifications to prairie marshes that change the pattern of spring inundation will lead to rapid and significant changes in marsh N cycling patterns.
1469925|In this special section of "Biogeochemistry", we present results from a snow manipulation experiment in the northern hardwood forest ecosystem at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, U.S.A. Snow is important as an insulator of forest soils. Later development of snowpacks, as may occur in a warmer climate, may result in increases in soil freezing (i.e. colder soils in a warmer world) and could cause changes in fine root and microbial mortality, hydrologic and gaseous losses of nitrogen (N), and the acid-base status of drainage water. In our study, we kept soils snow free by shoveling until early February during the mild winters of 1997/1998 and 1998/1999. The treatment produced mild, but persistent soil freezing and induced surprisingly significant effects on root mortality, soil nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) levels and hydrologic fluxes of C, N and P. In this special section we present four papers addressing, (1) soil temperature and moisture response to our snow manipulation treatment (Hardy et al.), (2) the response of fine root dynamics to treatment (Tierney et al.), (3) the response of soil inorganic N levels, in situ N mineralization and nitrification, denitrification and microbial biomass to the treatment (Groffman et al.) and (4) soil solution concentrations and fluxes of C, N and P (Fitzhugh et al.). In this introductory paper we: (1) review the literature on snow effects on forest biogeochemistry, (2) introduce our manipulation experiment and (3) summarize the results presented in the other papers in this issue.
1468916|Three protocols for the determination of inorganic and organic sulfur fractions were tested for their suitability to estimate total indigenous organic sulfur (S<sub>org</sub>) and <sup>35</sup>S<sub>org</sub> formed from added <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in sediments of chemically dilute lakes in the ELA. The protocols tested have all been reported in the literature. It was found that two protocols involving sequential analyses for S fractions following acid treatment gave estimates of both S<sub>org</sub> and <sup>35</sup>S<sub>org</sub> up to 87% lower than a non-sequential protocol. The low estimates were largely due to hydrolysis and solubilization of solid phase S which was then removed in a rinsing step. The non-sequential protocol, in which total reduced inorganic sulfur and total sulfur were determined on separate aliquots, is recommended as the most reliable of the three. Individual analyses in this protocol were verified for these lake sediments using a variety of S standards.
1469299|This study of the biogeochemical cycle of Ca has been carried out in an oakhornbeam forest ecosystem on a soil derived from the alteration of Famennian (upper Devonian) shales. The physical nature of the geologic substrate made it possible to use the watershed-ecosystem approach by monitoring the loss of Ca by streamflow. Input of hydrogen ions and Ca from rain were average as well as that of mineral nitrogen of which 50% was ammonium-N. Modelling the biogeochemical cycle of Ca in this ecosystem proved to be difficult owing to the heterogeneity of the geologic substrate. The cationic denudation occured mostly with bicarbonate ion as a carrier of the base cations towards the streamflow. Seasonal effects on streamwater cationic composition were in relation to maximal soil respiration occuring in the autumn. In addition to this effect, the electrolyte concentration of streamwater was determined by rain and by changes in concentration of the soil solution either by evapotranspiration or by freezing. In spite of widely fluctuating values of flow rate, the concentration of the streamflow remained constant within a factor of two or at the most three. The mechanism underlying this buffering action of the soil on the concentration of the solution flowing through it, was shown to be related to ion-exchange processes.
1469768|We measured porewater profiles of inorganic (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, (+NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> (hereafter referred to as DIP)) and organic (DON, DOP) nutrients in seagrass-vegetated sediments at two sites in a shallow bay in Bermuda within close proximity (200 m) but subject to different nutrient loading. At both sites, total dissolved and inorganic nutrient concentrations were usually 1-2 orders of magnitude higher in the sediments than in the water column, with the exception of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Organic N and P were significant components of the total dissolved nutrient pools both in the sediment porewater and in the overlying water column (up to 75% for DON and 40% for DOP), and may be important in meeting plant nutrient demands. We used two approaches to examine how well porewater nutrient concentrations reflected the relative availabilities of N and P for seagrasses: (1) a simple stoichiometric nutrient regeneration model based on the N:P ratio of decomposing organic matter and porewater NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations to predict porewater DIP, and (2) fitting of the porewater profiles to estimate rates of net nutrient production (or consumption), which reflects the balance between nutrient sources and sinks in the rhizosphere. The stoichiometric model indicated that sediment porewaters were depleted in P relative to N in the low-nutrient outer bay site, and enriched in P relative to N in the higher-nutrient inner bay site. These results are consistent with the mechanism of carbonate sediments in oligotrophic tropical environments being a strong sink for dissolved inorganic P and our previous work suggesting that nutrient enrichment causes P to become disproportionately more available than N. Net nutrient production rates of porewater P at both sites and N at the inner bay site were low (typically < 2%) relative to the nutrient demands of the seagrasses. The implications of the profile interpretation are two-fold: (1) the low rates of net nutrient production indicate diffusive losses from the root zone were insignificant and that nutrient turnover rates were high, except in the P-limited outer bay where N accumulated in sediment porewaters; and (2) because standing stock nutrient concentrations often represent a small fraction of the total nutrients cycled in the sediments, they are in many cases a poor indicator of nutrient availability. Based on our estimates of losses from the root zone, decomposition, and plant uptake we have constructed a rough budget for the cycling of P and N at our two sites.
20519881|To determine how plant species richness impacts microbial assimilation of new photosynthate, and how this may be modified by atmospheric N deposition, we analyzed the microbial assimilation of recent photosynthate in a 6-year-long field experiment in which plant species richness, atmospheric N deposition, and atmospheric CO concentration were manipulated in concert. The depleted C of fumigation CO enabled us to investigate the effect of plant species richness and atmospheric N deposition on the metabolism of soil microbial communities in the elevated CO treatment. To accomplish this, we determined the C of bacterial, actinobacterial, and fungal phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). In the elevated CO conditions of this study, the C of bacterial PLFAs (i15:0, i16:0, 16:17c, 16:19c, 10Me16:0, and 10Me18:0) and the fungal PLFA 18:19c was significantly lower in species-rich plant communities than in species-poor plant communities, indicating that microbial incorporation of new C increased with plant species richness. Despite an increase in plant production, total PLFA decreased under N deposition. Moreover, N deposition also decreased fungal relative abundance in species-rich plant communities. In our study, plant species richness directly increased microbial incorporation of new photosynthate, providing a mechanistic link between greater plant detritus production in species-rich plant communities and larger and more active soil microbial community.
40647958|We describe the climatology, hydrology and biogeochemistry of an extreme nitrogen deposition event that occurred in the highly glacierised environment of the European High Arctic during June 1999. Meteorological analysis, three-dimensional air mass trajectories and a 3D transport model show that blocking high pressures over Scandinavia and the rapid advection of western European pollution toward Svalbard were sufficient to cause the most concentrated (1.15 ppm NO-N and 1.20 ppm NH-N), high magnitude (total 26 mm and up to 2.4 mm h at 30 m above sea level) nitrogen deposition event on record in this sensitive, high Arctic environment (78.91 N, 11.93 E). Since the event occurred when much of the catchment remained frozen or under snow cover, microbial utilisation of nitrogen within snowpacks and perennially unfrozen subglacial sediments, rather than soils, were mostly responsible for reducing N export. The rainfall event occurred long before the annual subglacial outburst flood and so prolonged (ca. 10 day) water storage at the glacier bed further enhanced the microbial assimilation. When the subglacial outburst eventually occurred, high runoff and concentrations of NO (but not NH) returned in the downstream rivers. Assimilation accounted for between 53 and 72% of the total inorganic nitrogen deposited during the event, but the annual NO and NH runoff yields were still enhanced by up to 5 and 40 times respectively. Episodic atmospheric inputs of reactive nitrogen can therefore directly influence the biogeochemical functioning of High Arctic catchments, even when microbial activity takes place beneath a glacier at a time when terrestrial soil ecosystems remain frozen and unresponsive.
40343626|Plants fractionate Si isotopes which provides a useful Si tracer in the Si soil-plant cycle. This study reports plant Si content and Si-isotopic signatures in mature banana plants grown on soils with different weathering degree, but all developed from basaltic pyroclasts in the Mungo area, Cameroon. The Si compositions were determined in various plant parts and soil surface horizons by MC-ICP-MS in dry plasma mode with external Mg doping to a precision of  0.15 (<tex-math>$ \pm {\rm{ 2}}_{{\rm{\sigma SD}}} $</tex-math>). The Si-isotopic compositions in banana plants grown on weathered clayey soils (+ 0.54  0.15) are heavier than on weakly developed soils rich in fresh ash and pumice (+ 0.02  0.15). The corresponding bulk soils display lower < 5 3O Si value in weathered soil (-1.41) than in poorly developed soil (-0.41). We suggest that the dissolved Si source for the plant, governed firstly by dissolution of easily weatherable minerals, was isotopically enriched in heavy isotopes through clay formation over long periods. At seasonal to annual time scale, this source is influenced by a combination of following processes: Si adsorption of light isotopes onto Fe oxides, plant Si uptake and recycling in surface horizons. This would provide an isotopically heavier Si source in the more weathered soil since the Fe oxides content increases with weathering. Plant Si-isotopic signature might thus reflect the soil weathering degree. This study further suggests that in addition to weathering processes, rivers isotopic signatures likely depend on the fate of phytoliths in the soil-plant-river system.
20055258|Species composition affects the carbon turnover and the formation and emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH) in wetlands. Here we investigate the individual effects of vascular plant species on the carbon cycling in a wetland ecosystem. We used a novel combination of laboratory methods and controlled environment facilities and studied three different vascular plant species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Carex rostrata and Juncus effusus) collected from the same wetland in southern Sweden. We found distinct differences in the functioning of these wetland sedges in terms of their effects on carbon dioxide (CO) and CH fluxes, bubble emission of CH, decomposition of
24716788|Decreased acid deposition over recent decades has led to reductions in streamwater acidity on a widespread basis throughout the U.S. and Europe. A notable exception has been the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern U.S., where declines in acid deposition have not translated into similar trends in stream chemistry in these watersheds with highly-weathered soils. To better characterize this observed behavior, streamwater samples collected at 64 sites in western Virginia on a quarterly basis from 1987 to 2011 were analyzed for chemical properties. Individual watershed response was strongly influenced by the dominant underlying bedrock, which affected sulfate $\left({\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{4}^{2-}\right)$ adsorption and base cation supply. Overall, pH increased at a majority of sites across all bedrock types. However, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) decreased at most sites underlain by base-poor bedrock, suggesting the susceptibility to episodic acidification remains a serious threat to these streams. The declines in ANC were more closely related the depletion of base cations (Ca, Mg, K, and Na) rather than increased ${\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{4}^{2-}$ concentration. Sites with higher relative ${\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{4}^{2-}$ adsorption exhibited little change in ANC. A mass balance analysis of sulfur at a base-poor watershed revealed that exports have recently surpassed inputs for the first time within the several-decade period of record. This pattern appears likely to continue, and if sustained, the depletion of the stored pool of sulfur signifies an important precursor for further improvements in streamwater acidity in the region.
1469285| Soil CO<sub>2</sub> evolution rates, soil temperatures and moisture were measured during the dry season in two forest-to-pasture chronosequences in Rondnia, Brazil. The study included pastures ranging from 3 to 80 years-old. Mean dry-season CO<sub>2</sub> evolution from the forest in chronosequence I, 88.8 mg CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup> was lower than from the pastures which ranged from 111 to 158 mg CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>. We found that temperature was not a good predictor of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from pasture but that there was a significant relationship (r = 0.72, p < 0.05) between soil moisture and pasture emissions. The  <sup>13</sup>C of the soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions also was measured on chronosequence I;  <sup>13</sup>C of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from the C<sub>3</sub> forest was -29.43%. Pasture <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> values increased from -17.91% in the 3 year-old pasture to -12.86% in the 80 year-old, reflecting the increasing C<sub>4</sub> inputs with pasture age. Even in the youngest (3 year-old) pasture, 70 percent of the CO<sub>2</sub> evolved originated from C<sub>4</sub> pasture-derived carbon. 
1469976| We investigated the influences of forest or pasture land use and stream size on particulate and dissolved material concentrations in a network of second to third order streams in Rondnia, in the Brazilian Amazon. During the dry season, a second order stream originating in pasture had lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nitrate, higher concentrations of chlorophyll, total suspended solids, particulate organic carbon, particular organic nitrogen, ammonium, and phosphate than a second order stream originating in forest. Where the second order forest stream exited forest and entered pasture, concentrations of dissolved oxygen dropped from 6 mg/L to almost 0 mg/L and nitrate concentrations dropped from 12 M to 2 M over a reach of 2 km. These changes indicated a strong influence of land use. During the rainy season, differences among reaches of all particulate and dissolved materials were diminished. Concentrations of oxygen, chlorophyll, total suspended solids, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate in the third order pasture stream more closely resembled the second order forest stream than the second order pasture stream, suggesting that conditions in the channels of larger pasture streams more strongly control concentrations of these materials. If this pattern is widespread in stream networks of regions that consist of a mosaic of forest and pasture lands, it may have important consequences for understanding the effects of deforestation on larger rivers of the Amazon Basin. This would indicate that the effects of forest clearing on the concentrations of many suspended and dissolved materials will be most easily detected in very small streams but potentially difficult to detect in larger streams and rivers. 
1469081|Increased emissions of nitrogen compounds have led to atmospheric deposition to forest soils exceeding critical loads of N over large parts of Europe. To determine whether the chemistry of forest soils responds to changes in throughfall chemistry, intact soil columns were reciprocally transplanted between sites, with different physical conditions, across a gradient of N and S deposition in Europe. The transfer of a single soil to the various sites affected its net nitrification. This was not simply due to the nitrification of different levels of N deposition but was explained by differences in physical climates which influenced mineralization rates. Variation in the amount of net nitrification between soil types at a specific site were explained largely by soil pH. Within a site all soil types showed similar trends in net nitrification over time. Seasonal changes in net nitrification corresponds to oscillations in temperature but variable time lags had to be introduced to explain the relationships. With Arrhenius' law it was possible to approximate gross nitrification as a function of temperature. Gross nitrification equalled net nitrification after adaptation of the microbial community of transplanted soils to the new conditions. Time lags, and underestimates of gross nitrification in autumn, were assumed to be the result of increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> availability due either to changes in the relative rates of gross and net N transformations or to altered soil fauna-microbial interactions combined with improved moisture conditions. Losses of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> in non-acidified soil types and with losses of Al<sup>3+</sup> in the acidified soils. For single soils the ion equilibrium equation of Gaines-Thomas provided a useful approximation of Al<sup>3+</sup> concentrations in the soil solution as a function of the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The between site deviations from this predicted equilibrium, which existed for single soils, could be explained by differences in throughfall chemistry which affected the total ionic strength of the soil solution. The approach of reciprocally transferring soil columns highlighted the importance of throughfall chemistry, interacting with the effect of changes in physical climate on forest soil acidification through internal proton production, in determining soil solution chemistry. A framework outlining the etiology of forest die-back induced by nitrogen saturation is proposed.
41410562|Growing interest in the effects of global change on the metabolism, stoichiometry and cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems has motivated research on the export of organic carbon (OCE) from catchments. In this article, quantitative and functional features of the annual export rates of total, particulate and dissolved organic carbon (TOC, POC and DOC) were reviewed, and the stoichiometry of export (OC:N, OC:P and N:P) from 550 catchments worldwide was reported. TOC export ranged 2.1-92,474 kg C km year, POC export ranged 0.4-73,979 kg C km year and DOC export ranged 1.2-56,946 kg C km year. Exports of TOC and DOC were strongly linked, but POC export was unrelated to DOC. The DOC fraction comprised on average 73  21% of TOC export. The export rates of organic carbon were poorly related to those of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Discrete and continuous environmental variables failed to predict TOC export, but DOC export was influenced by discharge and catchment area worldwide. Models of OCE in different catchment types were controlled by different environmental variables; hydrological variables were generally better predictors of OCE than anthropogenic and soil variables. Elemental ratios of carbon export in most catchments were above the Redfield ratio, suggesting that phosphorus may become the limiting nutrient for downstream plant growth. These ratios were marginally related to environmental data. More detailed hydrological data, consideration of in-stream processes and the use of quasi-empirical dynamical models are advocated to improve our knowledge of OCE rates and those of other nutrients.
1468525|An experiment in which perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was grown in solution cultures containing various forms of radioactive gold (<sup>198</sup>Au) is described. Uptake of labelled Au from solutions containing either Au chloride or various Au-humic acid (HA) complexes is compared. In each case concentrations of Au in the plant roots were several fold higher than in the plant shoots. However, the Au concentration in roots from some of the Au-HA preparations was only about 5% of that from the Au-HA solutions. High voltage electrophoresis studies indicate the presence of several Au-HA complexes in the solution cultures. The relevance of these findings to the cycling of Au within soils is discussed.
40343552|Two methods were used to measure instream nitrogen loss in the Connecticut River during studies conducted in April and August 2005. A mass balance on nitrogen inputs and output for two study reaches (55 and 66 km), at spring high flow and at summer low flow, was computed on the basis of total nitrogen concentrations and measured river discharges in the Connecticut River and its tributaries. In a 10.3 km subreach of the northern 66 km reach, concentrations of dissolved N were also measured during summer low flow and compared to modeled N concentrations (based on temperature and atmospheric gas exchange rates) to determine the measured "excess" N that indicates denitrification. Mass balance results showed no in-stream nitrogen loss in either reach during April 2005, and no nitrogen loss in the southern 55 km study reach during August 2005. In the northern 66 km reach during August 2005, however, nitrogen output was 18% less than the total nitrogen inputs to the reach. N sampling results gave an estimated rate of N production that would remove 3.3% of the nitrogen load in the river over the 10.3 km northern sub-reach. The nitrogen losses measured in the northern reach in August 2005 may represent an approximate upper limit for nitrogen attenuation in the Connecticut River because denitrification processes are most active during warm summer temperatures and because the study was performed during the annual low-flow period when total nitrogen loads are small.
1468891|This paper presents a model of water flux and throughfall concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in a subalpine balsam fir forest. The model is based on a multi-layer submodel of hydrologic flow. Cloud water deposition and evaporation are incorporated as separate submodels. Chemical exchange is parameterized with diffusion resistances and internal foliar concentrations determined from leaching experiments on isolated canopy components. The model is tested against within-storm throughfall measurements and found to agree reasonably well in most instances. Some specific departures from observed data are noted, of which some can be explained. Differences between observed and modeled concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> early in the storm events suggest that pre-storm conditions, which were not modeled, are important in controlling the chemical exchange. Responses of throughfall chemistry to changes in rain rate, rain concentration, and stand surface area index (SAI) were investigated by simulation with the model. Increasing rain rates increased leaching of K<sup>+</sup> and uptake of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Increasing concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> in rain decreased slightly the amount of K<sup>+</sup> leached, but increasing concentration of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in rain increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake proportionately. Increasing canopy SAI increased the leaching of K<sup>+</sup> and the uptake of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, with the pattern of the increase dependent on rain rate.
1469236|The applicability of a recently presented method (Stepwise Thermogravimetry, STG) to characterize biogenic organic matter (Kristensen 1990) was tested in comparative decomposition experiments. The initial microbial decay of pre-dried, fresh detritus from 6 different plant materials (2 macroalgae, 2 seagrasses, and 2 tree leaves) was examined for 70 days in aerobic seawater slurries. In addition, slurries of sediment detritus of low reactivity, representing the late stage of plant decay, were allowed to decompose aerobically and anaerobically for 200 days. Macroalgae lost 40-44% carbon over 70 days, whereas seagrasses lost 29-33% and tree leaves lost 0-8%. After a 3-5 days leaching phase, the temporal pattern of POC and PON loss from the plant detritus was exponential with higher rates for the former resulting in a 5-28% reduced C:N ratio. The Rp index decreased (<20%) during the initial leaching phase followed by a 30-40% increase to the end. Initial Rp was directly proportional to decay rate. POC loss in the anaerobic sediment slurry was 10% over the 200 day period (the aerobic was hampered by low pH). Preferential loss of PON caused a 30% increase in C:N ratio. The Rp index of sediment detritus also increased with 30%. Although the present laboratory experiments not fully simulate the natural environment, the Rp-C:N relationship obtained from the two slurry experiments can illustrate the general pattern of plant decay from fresh to refractory (humic) detritus. During initial aerobic decay, rapid leaching and microbial growth causes a decrease in both Rp and C:N ('Rapid growth', phase 1). When all labile substrates have been consumed and the slower decay is controlled by enzymatic attack on particles with an associated production of humic compounds and accumulation of nitrogen rich bacterial cell remains, Rp increases and C:N decreases ('Slow growth', phase 2). Later, when condensed humic compounds have accumulated, decay ceases. Most carbon is now bound in forms which are of low availability to bacteria and a preferential mineralization of nitrogen occurs; both Rp and C:N increases ('Condenzation', phase 3).
1469987|The tropical semiarid soils of northwestern Yucatan, Mexico, have exceptionally high organic matter (OM) contents, between 50 and 150 g C kg<sup>-1</sup>. The soils are formed on limestone and form a mosaic of shallow black lithosols surrounding rock outcrops and deeper red rendzinas at slightly lower relief. Traditionally, these soils were managed under shifting cultivation with an uncommonly short cultivation period of only 2 years followed by a long bush fallow. We examined OM mineral associations using size and density fractionations of two soils after 1 and 12 years of fallow in a search for factors responsible for the high OM stability, short cultivation period and poor productivity. Light-fraction OM accounted for up to 38% of total soil OM and was responsible for almost all the OM accretion during fallow. Red soils contained half as much OM as black soils. Lower average OM contents of silt-size aggregates of red soils were due to a lower proportion of OC-rich agregates, not to differences in composition of individual aggregate classes. Expandable clays were practically absent in both soil types and sesquioxides were not related to OM contents or stability. Fine-sized secondary carbonates, undetectable to X-ray, impreganted light fraction OM and stabilized aggregates, and may be the principal cause of the OM accumulation. Mineralisation of coarse OM accumulated during fallow was impeded in both soils, but to a greater extent in the more calcareous black soils, so that relatively undecomposed OM accumulates to well above the levels that are typical for other semiarid tropical soils. Limited OM turnover will limit nutrient release, which may limit the agricultural productivity.
1469961|Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations measured in runoff from abandoned agricultural land now in forest succession in the northeastern United States were significantly higher than expected from undisturbed forest land. This finding differs from P uptake in hardwood forest succession following natural disturbance. Field monitoring of a 16.6 ha old-field regrowth forest stand in the Catskills Mountains, New York, USA demonstrated runoff SRP trends including an early summer flush that could not be explained by simple dilution. An assay of outflow sediment and biomass, flowpath sediment and biomass, forest floor leaf litter and biomass, and Bh horizon mineral soil indicated that surface litter from the regrowth forest provided the most significant contribution to the elevated SRP in runoff. It is posited that microbial mineralization of residual organic P in surface litter coupled with the transient process of SRP mobilization at the soil surface resulting from a rising saturated layer followed by dissolution in surface runoff may elevate SRP to the range observed. Measured SRP concentrations remain lower than reported values for crop or pastureland. The results reported represent an important deviation from the prevailing view that forest land does not contribute to eutrophication (based on enhanced P uptake in forest succession); this is a consequence of residual P from land abandonment -- a widespread practice throughout the northeastern US and other regions.
1469679| Land-use change is likely to be a major component of global change at high latitudes, potentially causing significant alterations in soil C and N cycling. We addressed the biogeochemical impacts of land-use change in fully replicated black spruce forests and agricultural fields of different ages (following deforestation) and under different management regimes in interior Alaska. Change from forests to cultivated fields increased summer temperatures in surface soil layers by 4-5 C, and lengthened the season of biological activity by two to three weeks. Decomposition of a common substrate (oat stubble) was enhanced by 25% in fields compared to forests after litter bags were buried for one year. In-situ net N mineralization rates in site-specific soil were similar in forests and fields during summer, but during winter, forests were the only sites where net N immobilization occurred. Field age and management had a significant impact on C and N mineralization. Rates of annual decomposition, soil respiration and summer net N mineralization tended to be lower in young than in old fields and higher in fallow than in planted young fields. To identify the major environmental factors controlling C and N mineralization, soil temperature, moisture and N availability were studied. Decomposition and net N mineralization seemed to be mainly driven by availability of inorganic N. Soil temperature played a role only when comparing forests and fields, but not in field-to-field differences. Results from soil respiration measurements in fields confirmed low sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration, and thus decomposition to temperature. In addition, both soil respiration and net N mineralization were limited by low soil water contents. Our study showed that (1) C and N mineralization are enhanced by forest clearing in subarctic soils, and (2) N availability is more important than soil temperature in controling C and N mineralization following forest clearing. Projecting the biogeochemical impacts of land-use change at high latitudes requires an improved understanding of its interactions with other factors of global change, such as changing climate and N deposition. 
40343514|Nitrogen (N) dynamics at the sedimentwater interface were examined in four regions of Florida Bay to provide mechanistic information on the fate and effects of increased  inputs to shallow, subtropical, coastal environments. Dissimilatory nitrate (NO) reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was hypothesized to be a significant mechanism retaining bioreactive N in this warm, saline coastal ecosystem. Nitrogen dynamics, phosphorus (P) fluxes, and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) were measured in northcentral (Rankin Key; eutrophic), north-eastern (Duck Key; high N to P seston ratios), north-western (Murray Key; low N to P ratios), and central (Rabbit Key; typical central site) Florida Bay in August 2004, January 2005, and November 2006. Site water was passed over intact sediment cores, and changes in oxygen (O), phosphate (o-PO), ammonium (NH), NO, nitrite (NO), and N concentrations were measured, without and with addition of excess NOor NH to inflow water. These incubations provided estimates of SOD, nutrient fluxes, N production, and potential DNRA rates. Denitrification rates were lowest in summer, when SOD was highest. DNRA rates and NH fluxes were high in summer at the eutrophic Rankin site, when denitrification rates were low and almost no N came from added NO Highest NH accumulation, resulting from DNRA, occurred at Rabbit Key during a picocyanobacteria bloom in November. NH accumulation rates among the stations correlated with SOD in August and January, but not in November during the algal bloom. These mechanistic results help explain why bioreactive  supply rates are sometimes high in Florida Bay and why denitrification efficiency may decrease with increased NO inputs in sub-tropical coastal environments.
24715157|Semi-arid ecosystems with annual moisture inputs dominated by snowmelt cover much of the western United States, and a better understanding of their seasonal drivers of soil respiration is needed to predict consequences of climatic change on soil CO efflux. We assessed the relative importance of temperature, moisture, and plant phenology on soil respiration during seasonal shifts between cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers in a Rocky Mountain meadow over 3.5 separate growing seasons. We found a consistent, unique pattern of seasonal hysteresis in the annual relationship between soil respiration and temperature, likely representative for this ecosystem type, and driven by (1) continued increase in soil T after summer senescence of vegetation, and (2) reduced soil respiration during cold, wet periods at the beginning versus end of the growing season. The timing of meadow senescence varied between years with amount of cold season precipitation, but on average occurred 45 days before soil temperature peaked in late-summer. Autumn soil respiration was greatest when substantial autumn precipitation events occurred early. Surface CO efflux was temporarily decoupled from respiratory production during winter 2006/2007, due to effects of winter surface snow and ice on mediating the diffusion of CO from deep soil horizons to the atmosphere. Upon melt of a capping surface ice layer, release of soil-stored CO was determined to be 65 g C, or  10 % of the total growing season soil respiration for that year. The shift between soil respiration sources arising from moisture-limited spring plant growth and autumn decomposition indicates that annual mineralization of soil carbon will be less dependent on projected changes in temperature than on future variations in amount and timing of precipitation for this site and similar semiarid ecosystems.
1469842| High elevation talus soils are extreme environments for life. They are pertinent to the hydrology and biochemical cycling of high elevation ecosystems that supply drinking water to major metropolitan areas, and are undergoing change as a result of N deposition. As biological systems, they are virtually unstudied. In order to gain a basic understanding of these important systems, we studied the seasonal timing of C inputs and microclimate, and how they corresponded to microbial biomass dynamics, in vegetated and unvegetated soils from a high altitude talus slope at 3750 m in the Colorado Front Range. The soil microclimate was described by soil moisture and temperature measurements; C inputs were estimated with measures of eolian dust inputs and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The biomass of different microbial functional groups (glutamate and salicylate mineralizers adapted to different temperatures) was estimated seasonally over 3 years. We found that the soil microclimate can be divided into three distinct seasons: Winter, with free water and temperature between -2.9 and 0 C; spring, characterized by wet isothermal soils (0 C); and summer, characterized by hot (mean 10.3 C; range 0-29.3 C) dry soils occasionally wetted by precipitation. The highest OM inputs to unvegetated soils occurred in spring; PAR only reached soils in the summer. In unvegetated soils, the biomass of glutamate mineralizers (GM) was highest in spring and summer. In contrast, the GM of vegetated soils had highest biomass in the winter when plants were senesced. In both unvegetated and vegetated soils, salicylate mineralizers (SM) had greater biomass levels in the summer when temperatures were highest. 
40343542|Seasonal variability in biogeochemical signatures was used to elucidate the dominant pathways of soil microbial metabolism and elemental cycling in an oligotrophic mangrove system. Three interior dwarf mangrove habitats (Twin Cays, Belize) where surface soils were overlain by microbial mats were sampled during wet and dry periods of the year. Porewater equilibration meters and standard biogeochemical methods provided steady-state porewater profiles of pH, chloride, sulfate, sulfide, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, phosphate, dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, reduced iron and manganese, dissolved inorganic carbon, methane and nitrous oxide. During the wet season, the salinity of overlying pond water and shallow porewaters decreased. Increased rainwater infiltration through soils combined with higher tidal heights appeared to result in increased organic carbon inventories and more reducing soil porewaters. During the dry season, evaporation increased both surface water and porewater salinities, while lower tidal heights resulted in less reduced soil porewaters. Rainfall strongly influenced inventories of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, possibly due to more rapid decay of mangrove litter during the wet season. During both times of year, high concentrations of reduced metabolites accumulated at depth, indicating substantial rates of organic matter mineralization coupled primarily to sulfate reduction. Nitrous oxide and methane concentrations were supersaturated indicating considerable rates of nitrification and/or incomplete denitrification and methanogenesis, respectively. More reducing soil conditions during the wet season promoted the production of reduced manganese. Contemporaneous activity of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis was likely fueled by the presence of noncompetitive substrates. The findings indicate that these interior dwarf areas are unique sites of nutrient and energy regeneration and may be critical to the overall persistence and productivity of mangrove-dominated islands in oligotrophic settings.
1468647|Nitrogen, Ca and Mg release from leaves of ten selected plant residues with varying chemical compositions was studied under laboratory conditions. Three patterns of N-release were observed over a seven week incubation period: (a) Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Mucuna pruriens and Centrosema pubescens leaves showed rapid N release, (b) Acioa barteri and Dialium guineense leaves immobilized N, and (c) Alchornea cordifolia, Anthonata macrophylla, Cassia siamea and Pterocarpus santalinoides leaves initially showed N immobilization which gradually changes to net mineralization after about four weeks of incubation. Nitrogen mineralization rate constant (k) ranged from -0.0018 (A. barteri) to 0.0064 day<sup>-1</sup> (G. sepium). Statistical analysis of data showed that N mineralization rate constants are significantly correlated with initial N, polyphenol and lignin contents of leaves. Nitrogen release increased with increasing N content and decreased with increasing contents of polyphenols and lignin. Addition of leaves from all species significantly increased soil exchangeable Ca and Mg levels. L. leucocephala, G. sepium, C. pubescens and M. pruriens showed relatively high Ca and Mg release rates. Calcium release rate was related to N release rate rather than to initial Ca content.
40980890|Changes in water pH and colour since the late 1980s were studied in 35 small boreal lakes of varying hydrological and landscape settings but similar climate and acid deposition. The data was collected during the autumnal overturn on the annual basis except in lake with weekly sampling during the ice-free period. In addition to the deposition data information about catchment soil types as well as local meteorological and hydrological conditions were used for the long-term data interpretation. The lakes are situated in a small area in southern Finland, 130 km north from Helsinki, where sulphate deposition declined by > 60% in one decade since the mid-1980s. The results showed that water colour increased in most lakes while pH did not. In lakes dominated by surface runoff there was a distinct upward shift in colour, with an initial increase after the mid-1990s and a second increase in 2004. The first shift appeared when the sulphate deposition reached a level ca. 25% of that in 1988. However, the upward shift in colour also coincided with a change in hydrological conditions after several dry summers. In contrast, the second shift in colour clearly coincided with a switch in hydrology due to the abnormally wet summer of 2004 after severe drought in 2002-2003. Although the hydrological conditions indisputably had a key role in determining the annual variability in colour, a distinct negative relationship between acid deposition and water colour in 90% of the lakes strongly suggested that reduction in sulphate deposition fostered the leaching of coloured organic substances from the catchment soils. Increase in colour, in turn, strongly influenced lake water pH, and the present day higher organic matter concentrations seemingly depress pH values more than in the 1980s, before the reduction in acid deposition.
1468556| Spatial variations in soil processes regulating mineral N losses to streams were studied in a small watershed near Toronto, Ontario. Annual net N mineralization in the 0-8 cm soil was measured in adjacent upland and riparian forest stands using in situ soil incubations from April 1985 to 1987. Mean annual rates of soil N mineralization and nitrification were higher in a maple soil (93.8 and 87.0 kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>) than in a pine soil (23.3 and 8.2 kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>). Very low mean rates of mineralization (3.3 kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>) and nitrification (3.4 kg.ha<sup>-1</sup>) were found in a riparian hemlock stand. Average NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations in soil solutions were 0.3-1.0 mg.L<sup>-1</sup> in the maple stand and <latex>$<0.06\ \text{mg}.\text{L}^{-1}$</latex> in the pine stand. Concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub>-N in shallow ground water and stream water were 3-4  greater in a maple subwatershed than in a pine subwatershed. Rapid N uptake by vegetation was an important mechanism reducing solution losses of NO<sub>3</sub>-N in the maple stand. Low rates of nitrification were mainly responsible for negligible NO<sub>3</sub>-N solution losses in the pine stand. 
1469016|A model for the calculation of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from perturbed forests ('extraordinary emissions') is described. Timber production as well as wildfire statistics are used, and relevant physicochemical parameters are derived from the literature, to calculate the annual amounts of perturbed biomass and extraordinary emissions to the atmosphere from the Spanish forests -- including soils -- in the years 1960-1990; these emissions increased from 5.3 10<sup>6</sup> t (metric tons) of carbon in 1970 to 10.6 10<sup>6</sup> t C in 1990. A sensitivity analysis of the results has been performed to identify the most critical parameters. Contributions of observed timber growth and natural vegetal detritus and soil organic matter to the net forest carbon flux have been estimated to calculate the carbon budget in the Spanish forests between 1966 and 1974, which represents a net gain of carbon, ranging from 9.2 to 18 millions t. Finally, the methods used to calculate biospheric carbon balance and their results are compared and discussed.
41490445|Iron oxy(hydr) oxides (oxides) are important mercury sinks in tropical oxisols and the geochemistry of these two elements are thus closely entwined. We hypothesized that bacterial Fe-oxide reduction in anoxic conditions could be a significant mechanism for mobilizing associated Hg. Iron oxide and mercury solubilisation in presence of two chemical reducers (ascorbate and dithionite, dissolving amorphous and amorphous plus well crystallized Fe-oxides, respectively) was compared to their solubilisation in presence of autochthonous ferri-reducing bacteria. This work was carried out on two soil profiles from a small catchment basin in French Guyana, an oxisol (O) from a well drained slope and a water-saturated hydromorphic soil (H). The chemical reductions showed that in the oxisol 20 and 48% of total Hg (Hg T ) was associated to amorphous and well crystallized iron oxides, respectively. However, in the hydromorphic soil, no Hg seemed to be associated to amorphous iron oxides while the well crystallized fraction contained less than 9% of Hg T . Chemical Fe-oxide reduction showed that Hg solubility was correlated to Fe reduction in the oxisol, demonstrating a relationship between the geochemistry of these two metals. During bacterial growth, while bacterial iron reduction solubilised up to 3.2 mg Fe g soil in the oxisol sample, H gT remained unchanged. No mercury was detected in the culture medium either. However, chemical analysis showed a decrease of the amounts of Hg associated to amorphous and well crystallized Fe-oxides after 14 days of incubation, underlining the potential for iron-reducing bacteria to modify mercury distribution in soil.
20519782|In this study, we conducted rainfall simulation experiments in a cool desert ecosystem to examine the role of biological soil crust disturbance and composition on dissolved and sediment C and N losses. We compared runoff and sediment C and N losses from intact late-successional dark cyanolichen crusts (intact) to both trampled dark crusts (trampled) and dark crusts where the top 1 cm of the soil surface was removed (scraped). In a second experiment, we compared C and N losses in runoff and sediments in early-successional light cyanobacterial crusts (light) to that of intact late-successional dark cyanolichen crusts (dark). A relatively high rainfall intensity of approximately 38 mm per 10-min period was used to ensure that at least some runoff was generated from all plots. Losses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and ammonium
1469788| Soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux was measured across 947 plots at 7 experimental grassland sites at the Cedar Creek Natural History Area in order to determine the relationships between soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux and environmental factors, living plant biomass, and soil C and N. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux increased as the day progressed, and was positively related to aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and soil % C. However, most of the variation in soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux explained by a multiple regression model (r<sup>2</sup>=0.55) was attributed to the different experimental sites (61%). Soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux increased with increasing aboveground plant biomass (explaining 16% of the model variation), belowground plant biomass (12%), and soil C and C:N ratio (6%). The length of time between aboveground biomass in a plot was clipped and soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux varied among plots. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux declined with increased time since clipping, supporting the idea that recently fixed carbon is a significant component of soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux. Soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux did not follow standard Q<sub>10</sub> relationships. Over a 20 C temperature range, soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux tended to be lower in warmer plots. More work is necessary to understand what factors explain the large differences that were seen among experimental sites in soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux that could not be explained by biomass or soil properties. 
20456570|Field litterbag studies were conducted in the 2000 rainy season and the 2000/2001 dry season along the transect of West African major agroecological zones (agroeco-zones) to measure the decomposition of, and N and P release from 5 plant residues (leaves of woody species) with increasing quality: Dactyladenia barteri, Pterocarpus santalinoides, Alchornea cordifolia, Senna siamea and Gliricidia sepium. The decomposition rate constant (wk) ranged from 0.034 (Dactyladenia, subhumid zone) to 0.49 (Gliricidia, humid zone) in the rainy season, and from 0.01 (Dactyladenia, subhumid zone) to 0.235 (Pterocarpus, arid zone) in the dry season. The direct correlation between the decomposition rate of plant residues and their quality was only valid in agroeco-zones where there is not moisture stress. Similarly, the direct correlation between the decomposition rate of plant residues and moisture availability was only valid for plant residues with high quality. The decomposition rate of the low quality plant residue could increase from humid to arid zone in West Africa. In the arid zone, the low quality plant residue could also decompose faster than high quality plant residue. The climate-residue quality interactive effects on plant residue decomposition in West Africa were attributed to the feedback of low quality plant residue's mulching effect, soil fauna and appreciable photodegradation in dry regions. A decomposition equation that could be used to predict the decomposition rate of plant residues with various qualities across agroeco-zones in West Africa was obtained from this study. The equation was expressed as follow:
40647929|Denitrification, the anaerobic reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogenous gases, is an extremely challenging process to measure and model. Much of this challenge arises from the fact that small areas (hotspots) and brief periods (hot moments) frequently account for a high percentage of the denitrification activity that occurs in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we describe the prospects for incorporating hotspot and hot moment phenomena into denitrification models in terrestrial soils, the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and in aquatic ecosystems. Our analysis suggests that while our data needs are strongest for hot moments, the greatest modeling challenges are for hotspots. Given the increasing availability of high temporal frequency climate data, models are promising tools for evaluating the importance of hot moments such as freeze-thaw cycles and drying/rewetting events. Spatial hotspots are less tractable due to our inability to get high resolution spatial approximations of denitrification drivers such as carbon substrate. Investigators need to consider the types of hotspots and hot moments that might be occurring at small, medium, and large spatial scales in the particular ecosystem type they are working in before starting a study or developing a new model. New experimental design and heterogeneity quantification tools can then be applied from the outset and will result in better quantification and more robust and widely applicable denitrification models.
24715089|Human actions have both intentionally and unintentionally altered the global economy of nitrogen (N), with both positive and negative consequences for human health and welfare, the environment and climate change. Here we examine long-term trends in reactive N (Nr) creation and efficiencies of Nr use within the continental US. We estimate that human actions in the US have increased Nr inputs by at least 5 times compared to pre-industrial conditions. Whereas N fixation as a by-product of fossil fuel combustion accounted for   of Nr inputs from the 1970s to 2000 (or 7 Tg N year), this value has dropped substantially since then (to <5 Tg N year), owing to Clean Air Act amendments. As of 2007, national N use efficiency (NUE) of all combined N inputs was equal to 40 %. This value increases to 55 % when considering intentional N inputs alone, with food, industrial goods, fuel and fiber production accounting for the largest Nr sinks, respectively. We estimate that 66 % of the N lost during the production of goods and services enters the air (as NO, NH, NO and N), with the remaining 34 % lost to various waterways. These Nr losses contribute to smog formation, acid rain, eutrophication, biodiversity declines and climate change. Hence we argue that an improved national NUE would: (i) benefit the US economy on the production side; (ii) reduce social damage costs; and (iii) help avoid some major climate change risks in the future.
41410580|Data from salt marshes in the U.S. Southeast show that long-term variations in mean water level (MWL) correlate strongly with salt marsh productivity and porewater salinity. Here we used numerical models of tidally-driven groundwater flow to assess the effect of variations in tidal amplitude and MWL on porewater exchange between salt marshes and tidal creeks. We modeled homogeneous and layered stratigraphy and compared flat and sloped topography for the marsh surface. Results are consistent with field observations and showed that increases in tidal amplitude increased groundwater flushing, particularly when increasing the tidal amplitude caused the marsh platform to be inundated at high tide. Increases in MWL caused groundwater flushing to increase if that rise caused greater areas of the marsh to be inundated at high tide. Once the marsh was fully inundated at high tide, further increases in MWL caused groundwater flushing to decrease. Results suggest that small increases in MWL associated with sea level rise could increase nutrient export significantly in marshes with elevations that are equilibrated near mean high water, but rising sea level could decrease the export of nutrients to, and thus fertility in, estuaries adjacent to marshes that are equilibrated lower in the tidal frame. Likewise, macrotidal estuaries are predicted to be subject to much larger groundwater and nutrient exchange than similar microtidal estuaries. We speculate that the early stages of rising relative sea level may significantly impact water quality in estuaries that are not river-dominated by raising the discharge of nutrients from coastal wetlands.
1468587|Lake Vanda is a permanently ice covered, meromictic, closed basin lake, located in the Dry Valley region of Southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. A unique feature of the lake water column structure is that the bottom lake waters exist as a natural diffusion cell. The diffusive nature of these waters allows rates of sulfate reduction, nitrification and denitrification to be calculated from nutrient concentration gradients. Calculation reveals that sulfate reduction is by far the most important anoxic process acting to oxidize organic material. In addition, rate calculations reveal that bottom water nutrient profiles are in steady state. One argument in support of this conclusion is that the calculated rate of nitrification balances the flux of ammonia from the anoxic lake waters. The flux of phosphorus from the reducing waters is several times less than would be predicted from the nitrogen and phosphorus content of decomposing lake seston. Solubility calculations show that phosphorus may be actively removed at depth in Lake Vanda by the formation of hydroxyapatite. It is found that estimated rates of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the bottom lake waters and sediments roughly balance the riverine input flux. This suggests that throughout the lake a nutrient steady state may exist, and that the anoxic zone may be the most important loci for nutrient removal. Finally, the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus entering Lake Vanda by riverine input is less than the 'Redfield' ratio of 16/1; in contrast to the lake waters which are strongly phosphorus limited at all depths. This curious aspect of the lake's nutrient chemistry is explained by the presence of preformed nitrogen, which has been concentrated in the deep brine due to several episodes of evaporative concentration.
40800610|Carbon stocks in the High Arctic are particularly sensitive to global climate change and the investigation of the variation in organic matter (OM) composition is beneficial for improved understanding of OM vulnerability. OM biomarker characterization of solventextractable compounds and CuO oxidation products of littoral sedimentary OM in the Canadian Arctic was conducted to determine OM sources and decomposition patterns. The solvent-extracts contained a series of aliphatic lipids, steroids and one triterpenoid of higher plant origin as well as the low abundance of iso-and anteiso-alkanes originating from Cerastium arcticum (Arctic mouse-ear chickweed), a native angiosperm. The carbon preference index (CPI) of the n-alkane, n-alkanol and n-alkanoic acid biomarkers suggests relatively fresh lipid material in the early stages of degradation. The CuO oxidation products were comprised of benzenes, lignin-derived phenols and shortchain diacids and hydroxyacids. A high abundance of these terrestrial biomarkers at sites close to the river inlet suggests soil-derived fluvial inputs are an important source of OM delivered to the littoral sediments. The high lignin-derived phenol ratios of acids to aldehydes suggest that lignin degradation is in a relatively advanced oxidation stage. The absence of ergosterol, a common fungal biomarker also suggests that ligninderived OM may be preserved in soil OM and transported to littoral sediments. This representative OM characterization suggests that Arctic sedimentary OM is a mixture of recently deposited and/or preserved lipids in permafrost melt and oxidized lignin-derived OM that may become destabilized from external influences such as climate change.
20456549|Wind is a key abiotic factor that influences the dynamics of arid and semiarid systems. We investigated two basic relationships on vegetation manipulation (grass cover reduction) plots at the Jornada Experimental Range in southern New Mexico: (1) wind erosion rates (horizontal mass flux and dust emission) versus vegetative cover, and (2) nutrient loss versus vegetative cover. The results indicate that wind erosion rates and nutrient loss by dust emission are strongly affected by plant cover; however, the importance of shrubs and grasses in reducing dust flux may not be equal. The dramatic increase of wind erosion between 75% grass cover reduction and 100% grass cover reduction suggests that sparsely distributed mesquites are relatively ineffective at reducing wind erosion and nutrient loss compared to grasses. Comparisons of nutrients between surface soils and wind blown dust indicate that aeolian transport is a major cause for the loss of soil nutrients in susceptible environments. We found that increased aeolian flux over three windy seasons (March 2004-July 2006) removed up to 25% of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) from the top 5 cm of soil, and about 60% of TOC and TN loss occurred in the first windy season (March-July 2004). The balance between net loss of nutrients by aeolian processes and the addition of nutrients by biotic processes changed from negative (net loss) to positive (net accumulation) between 50% grass cover reduction and 25% grass cover reduction. The estimated lifetime of surface soil TOC and TN of about 10 years on the plot with 100% grass cover reduction indicates that impacts of wind erosion on soil resources can occur on very short timescales.
20456566|Prolonged dry periods, and increasingly the generation of smoke and dust in partially-deforested regions, can influence the chemistry of rainfall and throughfall in moist tropical forests. We investigated rainfall and throughfall chemistry in a palm-rich open tropical rainforest in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon state of Rondnia, where precipitation averages 2300 mm year with a marked seasonal pattern, and where the fragmentation of remaining forest is severe. Covering the transition from dry to wet season (TDWS) and the wet season (WS) of 2004-2005, we sampled 42 rainfall events on event basis as well as 35 events on a within-event basis, and measured concentrations of DOC, Na, K, Ca, Mg,
1469264| We studied the effect of a calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) treatment on peat and pore water chemistry in poor fen and conifer swamp wetlands next to Woods Lake and its tributaries to evaluate the role of wetlands in an Experimental Watershed Liming Study (EWLS). Peat was characteristically organic rich and nutrient poor, with exchangeable Ca concentrations of < 13 cmol<sub>c</sub>kg<sup>-1</sup>. We estimated that between 0.4 to 4 Mg CaCo<sub>3</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> fell directly on three study sites; however, one year after the treatment the increase in Ca concentration (0-8 cm depth) was equivalent to a CaCO<sub>3</sub> dosage of 3 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> with an additional 2-4 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> of undissolved CaCO<sub>3</sub> still present, suggesting the peat retained Ca supplied from uplands. Most aspects of peat chemistry including microbial respiration and SO<sub>4</sub> reduction did not respond to the treatment. Peat pore water (5 and 20 cm depths) had a mean pH of 4.82 before treatment with high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC mean of 790 mol C/l) and low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (mean of 32 mol/l). The CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment increased concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to a mean of 87 mol/l and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from 205 to a mean of 411 mol/l, whereas it decreased monomeric Al concentration from 19 to 10 mol/l. Otherwise, pore water chemistry showed little response to the treatment, at least within natural spatial and temporal variation of solute concentrations. The results suggest that liming watersheds with the relatively low CaCO<sub>3</sub> dosage applied in this study can benefit acidic waters downstream by exporting more Ca and DIC and less monomeric Al, with otherwise little effect on the peat itself. 
25652592|For soil carbon to be effectively sequestered beyond a timescale of a few decades, this carbon must become incorporated into passive reservoirs or greater depths, yet the actual mechanisms by which this occurs is at best poorly known. In this study, we quantified the magnitude of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching and subsequent retention in soils of a coniferous forest and a coastal prairie ecosystem. Despite small annual losses of DOC relative to respiratory losses, DOC leaching plays a significant role in transporting C from surface horizons and stabilizing it within the mineral soil. We found that DOC movement into the mineral soil constitutes 22% of the annual C inputs below 40 cm in a coniferous forest, whereas only 2% of the C inputs below 20 cm in a prairie soil could be accounted for by this process. In line with these C input estimates, we calculated advective transport velocities of 1.05 and 0.45 mm year for the forested and prairie sites, respectively. Radiocarbon measurements of field-collected DOC interpreted with a basic transport-turnover model indicated that DOC which was transported and subsequently absorbed had a mean residence time of 90150 years. Given these residence times, the process of DOC movement and retention is responsible for 20% of the total mineral soil C stock to 1 m in the forest soil and 9% in the prairie soil. These results provide quantitative data confirming differences in C cycles in forests and grasslands, and suggest the need for incorporating a better mechanistic understanding of soil C transport, storage and turnover processes into both local and regional C cycle models.

1468922|We tested the hypothesis that P was the nutrient limiting net primary production of a native Metrosideros polymorpha forest on a highly weathered montane tropical soil in Hawaii. A factorial experiment used all combinations of three fertilizer treatments: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and a mix of other essential nutrients (OE), consisting primarily of mineral derived cations and excluding N and P. P addition, but not N or OE, increased leaf area index within 12 months, foliar P concentration measured at 18 months, and stem diameter increment within 18 months. Stem growth at 18 months was even greater when trees fertilized with P also received the OE treatment. N and P additions increased leaf litterfall and N and P in combination further increased litterfall. The sequence of responses suggests that increased available P promoted an increase in photosynthetic area which led to increased wood production. P was the essential element most limiting to primary production on old volcanic soil in contrast to the N limitation found on young volcanic soils.
40343531|Wetlands of northern Belize, distributed along a salinity gradient, are strongly phosphorus limited and dominated largely by three species of emergent macrophytes: Eleocharis cellulosa, Cladium jamaicense, and Typha domingensis. We assessed changes in root and sediment phosphatase activities of each species to simultaneous changes of nutrients (N, P) and salinity in a mesocosm experiment. Phosphorus and nitrogen treatment effects on both root and sediment phosphatase were highly significant for all the species, while salinity significantly affected root phosphatase activity in Cladium only. All species showed a significant negative correlation between root phosphatase activity and increasing tissue p content until a threshold of 0.2% P, 0.15% p and 0.12% p in Eleocharis, Cladium and Typha, respectively. There was also a significant negative correlation between soil available p and root and sediment phosphatases in all species. Activity of root phosphatases of Eleocharis and Typha were positively correlated with root tissue N. Both root and sediment phosphatases of all three species were positively correlated with soil available N. The strongest (positive) correlation was found between phoshatase activits and N/P ratios. The results confirmed that these systems are Plimited and that extracellular phosphatases respond to  enrichment by decreasing their activities. Expression of root phosphatase activity by dry root weight, sediment volume, or whole plant biomass gave very different relative results across nutrient treatments and species, suggesting that root phosphatase activities need to be interpreted in a wider context that considers root density.
40800607|We report a data-set of dissolved methane (CH) in three rivers (Como, Bia and Tano) and five lagoons (Grand-Lahou, Ebri, Potou, Aby and Tendo) of Ivory Coast (West Africa), during the four main climatic seasons (high dry season, high rainy season, low dry season and low rainy season). The surface waters of the three rivers were over-saturated in CH with respect to atmospheric equilibrium (2221-38719%), and the seasonal variability of CH seemed to be largely controlled by dilution during the flooding period. The strong correlation of CH concentrations with the partial pressure of CO(pCO) and dissolved silicate (DSi) confirm the dominance of a continental sources (from soils) for both CO and CH in these rivers. Diffusive air-water CH fluxes ranged between 25 and 1187 mol m day and annual integrated values were 288  107, 155  38, and 241  91 mol m day in the Como, Bia and Tano rivers, respectively. In the five lagoons, surface waters were also over-saturated in CH (ranging from 1496 to 51843%). Diffusive air-water CH fluxes ranged between 20 and 2403 mol m day, and annual integrated values were 78  34, 338  217, 227  79, 330  153 and 326  181 mol m day in the Grand-Lahou, Ebri, Potou, Aby and Tendo lagoons, respectively. The largest CH oversaturations were observed in the Tendo and Aby lagoons that are permanently stratified systems (unlike the other three lagoons), leading to anoxic bottom waters favorable for a large CH production. In addition, these two stratified lagoons showed low pCO values due to high primary production, which suggests an efficient transfer of organic matter across the pycnocline. As a result, the stratified Tendo and Aby lagoons were respectively, a low source of CO to the atmosphere and a sink of atmospheric CO while the other three well-mixed lagoons were strong sources of CO to the atmosphere but less oversaturated in CH.
20519781|The Mediterranean climate, with its characteristic of dry summers and wet winters, influences the hydrologic and microbial processes that control carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical processes in chaparral ecosystems. These biogeochemical processes in turn determine N cycling under chronic N deposition. In order to examine connections between climate and N dynamics, we quantified decadal-scale water, C and N states and fluxes at annual, monthly and daily time steps for a California chaparral ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada using the DAYCENT model. The daily output simulations of net mineralization, stream flow and stream nitrate (NO) export were developed for DAYCENT in order to simulate the N dynamics most appropriate for the abrupt rewetting events characteristic of Mediterranean chaparral ecosystems. Overall, the magnitude of annual modeled net N mineralization, soil and plant biomass C and N, nitrate export and gaseous N emission agreed with those of observations. Gaseous N emission was a major N loss pathway in chaparral ecosystems, in which nitric oxide (NO) is the dominant species. The modeled C and N fluxes of net primary production (NPP), N uptake and N mineralization, NO export and gaseous N emission showed both high inter-annual and intra-annual variability. Our simulations also showed dramatic fire effects on NPP, N uptake, N mineralization and gaseous N emission for three years of postfire. The decease in simulated soil organic C and N storages was not dramatic, but lasted a longer time. For the seasonal pattern, the predicted C and N fluxes were greatest during December to March, and lowest in the summer. The model predictions suggested that an increase in the N deposition rate would increase N losses through gaseous N emission and stream N export in the chaparral ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada due to changes in N saturation status. The model predictions could not capture stream NO export during most rewetting events suggesting that a dry-rewetting mechanism representing the increase in N mineralization following soil wetting needs to be incorporated into biogeochemical models of semi-arid ecosystems.
40343541|The nitrogen (N) budget was developed for Jiulong River Watershed (JRW), an agricultural watershed in a warm and humid area of southeast China. Water quality monitoring, field surveys, modelling and GIS techniques were applied to estimate N flux of atmospheric deposition, mineralization, runoff, denitrification, and ammonia volatilization. Over the whole watershed, fertilizers, import of animal feeds, biotic fixation, mineralization and atmospheric deposition contributed 67.1%, 16.5%, 2.1%, 4.9% and 9.5%, respectively, of total N input (129.3 kg N ha year). Runoff, sale of production, denitrification, and ammonia volatilization contributed 7.3%, 24.4%, 10.5% and 57.8% of total N output (72.9 kg N ha year), respectively. The N budget for the JRW suggested that more than 50% of the N input was lost to the environment, and about 14% was discharged as riverine N, which indicated that agricultural and human activities in the watershed substantially impacted the estuary and coastal water quality, and so altered the N biogeochemistry process.
1468793|We measured the exchange of N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> between the atmosphere and soils in 5 spruce-fir stands located along a transect from New York to Maine. Nitrous oxide emissions averaged over the 1990 growing season (May-September) ranged from 2.1 ug N<sub>2</sub>O-N/m<sup>2</sup>-hr in New York to 0.4 ug N<sub>2</sub>O-N/m<sup>2</sup>-hr in Maine. The westernmost sites, Whiteface Mtn., New York and Mt. Mansfield, Vermont, had the highest nitrogen-deposition, net nitrification and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Soils at all sites were net sinks for atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub>. Methane uptake averaged over the 1990 growing season ranged from 0.02 mg CH<sub>4</sub>-C/m<sup>2</sup>-hr in Maine to 0.05 mg CH<sub>4</sub>-C/m<sup>2</sup>-hr in Vermont. Regional differences in CH<sub>4</sub> uptake could not be explained by differences in nitrogen-deposition, soil nitrogen dynamics, soil moisture or soil temperature. We estimate that soils in spruce-fir forests at our study sites released ca. 0.02 to 0.08 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N/ha and consumed ca. 0.74 to 1.85 kg CH<sub>4</sub>-C/ha in the 1990 growing season.
1468623|Different soils of an urban forest in New York City showed relatively low, yet similar rates of N mineralization and nitrification in laboratory potential measurements. This consistent pattern occurred even though a number of factors known to influence these processes (including overstory vegetation, soil type, and heavy metal levels) differed between the urban samples. Net N mineralization rates in forest floor and A horizon samples from a hemlock stand within the urban forest were 81% and 53% lower than respective samples from a comparable rural stand. In addition, all forest floor and A horizon samples from the urban forest were extremely hydrophobic. The low mineralization rates and hydrophobic nature of the urban samples suggested that factors associated with the 'urban grime' hydrocarbons may be limiting the activity of soil microbes and invertebrates. Trampling and high concentrations of heavy metals may have synergistic effects that would act to reduce net N mineralization and nitrification within the urban forest.
1469188|Soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux and pCO<sub>2</sub> in the soil atmosphere were measured during one year at three montane sites of Mediterranean sclerophyllous forests in NE Spain. Two sites were located in the upper and lower slopes of a small catchment in the Prades mountains (mean precipitation 550 mm year<sup>-1</sup>), and a third site was located on a lower slope in the Montseny mountains (mean precipitation 900 mm year<sup>-1</sup>). The three sites were similar in bedrock and vegetation, but differed in soil characteristics and water availability. Seasonal variation of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux and soil pCO<sub>2</sub> were affected by soil temperature and, to a lesser extent, by soil moisture. Annual mean soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux (considered as soil respiration) was similar at Montseny and at the comparably located site at Prades (83 18 S.E. vs. 75 9 mg CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> hour<sup>-1</sup>, respectively), and was highest at the Prades upper slope site (122 22 mg CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> hour<sup>-1</sup>). Despite those relatively similar CO<sub>2</sub> effluxes, mean soil pCO<sub>2</sub> was much higher at both Prades sites than at Montseny. Soil pCO<sub>2</sub> always increased with depth at Prades while maxima pCO<sub>2</sub> at Montseny were often at 20-30 cm depth. A model based on gas diffusion theory was able to explain why soil pCO<sub>2</sub> was much higher at Prades than at Montseny, and to reproduce the shape of the vertical profile of pCO<sub>2</sub> at the Prades soils. Nevertheless, the model failed to simulate the soil pCO<sub>2</sub> maximum found at 20-30 cm depth at the Montseny site. Model simulations using a time-variable CO<sub>2</sub> production rate suggested that pCO<sub>2</sub> maxima at intermediate depth could be the result of a transient situation instead of an equilibrium one.
24715152|Genesis of soil organic matter (SOM) during pedogenesis is still a matter of controversy in soil science. Recently, it was hypothesized that microbial cell-envelope fragments contribute significantly to SOM formation. We tested the relevance of this process during pedogenesis by evaluating the development of SOM along a chronosequence of a glacier forefield (Damma glacier). Samples of increasing soil age collected along the forefield were analyzed for C and N contents, phospholipid and total fatty acids (PLFA and tFA), water contact angle, micro-hydrophobicity and surface coverage by microbial cell-envelope residues. The surface coverage was visualized and quantified by analysis of representative, equally-scaled scanning electron micrographs (SEM). Increasing SOM contents were accompanied by increasing coverage and overall abundance of microbial cell-envelope fragments as evaluated on the basis of scanning electron microscopy; this is also reflected in the amounts of tFA and PLFA, the trend of C/N ratios, and the increasing hydrophobicity and water contact angles of the soil samples. Using SEM and the image analysis approach, we can provide a processbased description of the development of SOM in the newly developing ecosystem of the glacier forefield. The majority of small-sized SOM visible with scanning electron microscopy appears to consist of bacterial cell envelope fragments that remain stable after cell death, such that their shape does not change with soil age. Our results show the importance of microbial processing of SOM, and highlight the existence of microbial necromass as a significant part of the fine-particulate SOM even in later stages of soil development.
41410572|Climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in extreme rainfall and, in coastal areas, seasalt deposition events. The impacts of these two climatic extremes on stream hydrochemistry were separately evaluated via a novel watering manipulation at the Grdsjn experimental catchment, SW Sweden. In summer 2004, a 2000 m hillslope draining to a defined stream reach was brought to a high-flow hydrological steady state for a 9 day period by sustained addition of 'clean' water using a distributed sprinkler system. Marine ions were then added, to generate a realistic 'sea salt' episode. A remarkably well constrained hydrological response was observed, such that a simple two-compartment mixing model could reasonably well reproduce observed conservative tracer (chloride, Cl) measurements, and 78% of added water was recovered in runoff. Stream base cation concentrations and acidity responded predictably to clean water and sea-salt addition, with the former leading to an increase in pH and acid neutralising capacity, and the latter to episodic acidification through hydrogen ion and aluminium displacement from soil exchange sites by marine base cations. Anion responses were less predictable: water addition caused a flush of nitrate, but this was apparently independent of rainfall composition. Sulphate remained near-constant during clean water addition but declined sharply during seasalt addition, indicative of a strong, pH-dependent solubility control on leaching, presumably adsorption/desorption in the mineral soil. Most strikingly, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were stable during clean water addition but varied dramatically in response to sea-salt addition, exhibiting a strong negative correlation with Cl concentrations in water draining the organic soil. These observations provide a robust experimental verification of the hypothesis that deposition chemistry, through its influence on acidity and/or ionic strength, has a major influence on DOC leaching to surface waters. was observed, such that a simple two-compartment mixing model could reasonably well reproduce observed conservative tracer (chloride, Cl) measurements, and 78% of added water was recovered in runoff.

1468970| Measurements of the net methane exchange over a range of forest, moorland, and agricultural soils in Scotland were made during the period April to June 1994 and 1995. Fluxes of CH<sub>4</sub> ranged from oxidation - 12.3 to an emission of 6.8 ng m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. The balance between CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation and emission depended on the physical conditions of the soil, primarily soil moisture. The largest oxidation rates were found in the mineral forest soils, and CH<sub>4</sub> emission was observed in several peat soils. The smallest oxidation rate was observed in an agricultural soil. The relationship between CH<sub>4</sub> flux and soil moisture observed in peats (Flux<sub>CH<sub>4</sub></sub>=0.023 %H<sub>2</sub>O (dry weight) - 7.44, p < 0.05) was such that CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation was observed at soil moistures less than 325%( 80%). CH<sub>4</sub> emission was found at soil moistures exceeding this value. A large range of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rates were observed over a small soil moisture range in the mineral soils. CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in mineral soils was negatively correlated with soil bulk density (Flux<sub>CH4</sub> = -37.35  bulk density (g cm<sup>-3</sup>) +48.83, p < 0.05). Increased nitrogen loading of the soil due to N fixation, atmospheric deposition of N, and fertilisation, were consistently associated with decreases in the soil sink for CH<sub>4</sub> typically in the range 50 to 80%, on a range of soil types and land uses. 
41490427|Understanding forest carbon cycling responses to atmospheric N deposition is critical to evaluating ecosystem N dynamics. The natural abundance of N ( N) has been suggested as an efficient and non-invasive tool to monitor N pools and fluxes. In this study, three successional forests in southern China were treated with four levels of N addition. In each treatment, we measured rates of soil N mineralization, nitrification, NO emission and inorganic N leaching as well as N concentration and <  N of leaves, litters and soils. We found that foliar N concentration and <  N were higher in the mature broadleaf forest than in the successional pine or mixed forests. Three-year continuous N addition did not change foliar N concentration, but significantly increased foliar <  N (p < 0.05). Also, N addition decreased the <  N of top soil in the N-poor pine and mixed forests and significantly increased that of organic and mineral soils in N-rich broadleaf forests (p < 0.05). In addition, the soil NO emission flux and inorganic N leaching rate increased with increasing N addition and were positively correlated with the N enrichment factor ( p/s ) of forest ecosystems. Our study indicates that  N of leaf, litter and soil integrates various information on plant species, forest stand age, exogenous N input and soil N transformation and loss, which can be used to monitor N availability and N dynamics in forest ecosystems caused by increasing N deposition in the future.
41490546|Global environmental changes are expected to alter ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling, but the interactive effects of multiple simultaneous environmental changes are poorly understood. Effects of these changes on the production of nitrous oxide (NO), an important greenhouse gas, could accelerate climate change. We assessed the responses of soil NO fluxes to elevated CO, heat, altered precipitation, and enhanced nitrogen deposition, as well as their interactions, in an annual grassland at the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment (CA, USA). Measurements were conducted after 6, 7 and 8 years of treatments. Elevated precipitation increased NO efflux, especially in combination with added nitrogen and heat. Path analysis supported the idea that increased denitrification due to increased soil water content and higher labile carbon availability best explained increased NO efflux, with a smaller, indirect contribution from nitrification. In our data and across the literature, single-factor responses tended to overestimate interactive responses, except when global change was combined with disturbance by fire, in which case interactive effects were large. Thus, for chronic global environmental changes, higher order interactions dampened responses of NO efflux to multiple global environmental changes, but interactions were strongly positive when global change was combined with disturbance. Testing whether these responses are general should be a high priority for future research.
4151482|In the central part of the Netherlands, wetland restoration projects involve the rewetting of former agricultural land, where low water levels were artificially maintained (polders). Many of these projects do not result in the expected reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus availability and subsequent re-establishment of a diverse wetland vegetation. The aim of the present study was to investigate which mechanisms are responsible for this lack of success. Thereto, we studied the effect of rewetting of former agricultural grasslands on acidified peat soil (pH = 3.5) on organic matter decomposition, nitrogen cycling and phosphorus availability in the soil for three seasons. To provide an explanation for the observed effects, we simultaneously studied a set of potentially controlling abiotic soil conditions that were expected to change after rewetting. It was found that rewetting of these grasslands with natural, unpolluted seepage water did not affect nitrogen cycling, but raised decomposition rates and almost doubled phosphorus availability. The main cause of these effects is a raise of soil pH to about 7 due to the hydrochemical composition of the soil pore water after rewetting, which reflects groundwater with high amounts of buffering ions. This effect overruled any reduction in process rates by the lowered soil redox potential. The counterintuitive finding of eutrophication after rewetting with natural and unpolluted water is considered to represent a new form of internal eutrophication, triggered by the restoration of natural site conditions of former agricultural land on acid peat soil.
1469079| Concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC & POC) in river waters were measured during 1993-1994 in the Lanyang Hsi watershed, which represents a typical small Oceania river. The DOC concentrations varied in the range of 0.5-4 mg/l during non-typhoon period, but rose to as high as 8 mg/l during Typhoon Tim in July, 1994. Based on the log-linear relationship between the DOC load and the discharge rate, we estimated the DOC export to be 3.4  0.6 ktC/yr, and the DOC yield to be 4.1  0.7 gC/m<sup>2</sup>/yr, which is considerably higher than a former estimate (ca. 0.1 gC/m<sup>2</sup>/yr) for the Oceania. On the other hand, the DOC yield is less than the concurrent POC yield (21.7  4.7 gC/m<sup>2</sup>/yr) by a factor of five, but most of the exported POC is fossil carbon. Under the assumption that the suspended sediments contain a mean fossil POC content of 0.5%, the nonfossil POC yield was calculated to be 4.6  3.0 gC/m<sup>2</sup>/yr, comparable to the DOC yield. Since DOC and nonfossil POC are directly related to the ecosystem, their combined fluxes give a biogenic organic carbon yield of 8.7  3.1 gC/m<sup>2</sup>/yr. 
1469322| Fish mercury concentrations were monitored before and after the construction of the La Grande hydroelectric complex, located in the James Bay region. Qubec, Canada, Monitoring results revealed that sympatric populations of dwarf and normal lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) occur in reservoirs and natural lakes of the area. Dwarf specimens bioaccumulate mercury more rapidly than normal individuals. In natural Srigny Lake, 6-7 year old dwarf specimens show mean total mercury levels 1.5 times higher than normal individuals of the same age (0.33 vs 0.21 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> wet weight). Eleven years after the impoundment of the Caniapiscau reservoir, 6-7 year old dwarf specimens show total mercury concentrations 3 times higher than normal specimens of similar ages (0.74 vs 0.27 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). Stomach content analysis showed that although large normal individuals feed on different prey than do dwarf individuals, similar methyl mercury levels were found in prey of both forms. We suggest that dwarf individuals bioaccumulate mercury more rapidly than normal specimens because they begin to mature at an earlier age (usually at age 2 to 3 compared to age 6 for normal specimens) and thus produce proportionally less flesh to dilute the mercury assimilated. Total mercury analysis indicating higher concentrations in flesh than in gonads support this hypothesis. Our results suggest that when monitoring mercury levels in fish in areas where populations of dwarf and normal lake whitefish coexist, dwarf and normal specimens must be distinguished because of their different bioaccumulation rates. 
1469501|During a two-year field study, an annual nutrient budget and cycles were developed for a small agricultural watershed. The study emphasized the integrated unit of the watershed in understanding the biogeochemistry. It was found that the total nutrient input was 39.1 10<sup>4</sup> kg nitrogen and 3.91 10<sup>4</sup> kg phosphorus in the year 1995, of which the greatest input of nutrients to the watershed was chemical fertilizer application, reaching 34.7 10<sup>4</sup> kg (676 kg/ha) nitrogen and 3.88 10<sup>4</sup> kg (76 kg/ha) phosphorus. The total nutrient output from the watershed was 13.55 10<sup>4</sup> kg nitrogen and 0.40 10<sup>4</sup> kg phosphorus, while the largest output of nitrogen was denitrification, accounting for 44.1% of N output; the largest output of phosphorus was sale of crops, accounting for 99.4% of P output. The results show that the nutrient input is larger than output, demonstrating that there is nutrient surplus within the watershed, a surplus which may become a potential source of nonpoint pollution to area waters. The research showed that both denitrification and volatilization of nitrogen are key ways of nitrogen loss from the watershed. This suggests that careful management of fertilizer application will be important for the sustainable development of agriculture. The research demonstrated that a multipond system within the watershed had high retention rate for both water and nutrients, benefiting the water, nutrient and sediment recycling in the terrestrial ecosystem and helping to reduce agricultural nonpoint pollution at its source. Therefore, this unique watershed system should be recommended due to its great potential relevance for sustainable agricultural development.
25652621|A field experiment was established at Harwood Forest to investigate the effects of three forest management practises (drainage, mounding and fertilisation) on methane (CH) emissions and environmental variables (soil temperature, soil moisture content, water table depth) from 2006 to 2008. The relationship between CH emissions and environmental variables was also evaluated. The experiment was laid out in a factorial split-plot design on grassland in a peaty gley soil. Drainage increased daytime soil temperature at all depths. Mounding increased soil temperature at 1 and 5 cm depth. Soil moisture content was decreased by drainage and mounding. All practises affected soil CH emissions with drainage reducing emissions by 5776% and mounding and fertilisation increasing emissions by 3459 and 2059%, respectively. Water table depth was the major factor controlling CH emissions.
24715140|To investigate the causes of the reduced stature of heath forest compared to lowland evergreen rain forest (LERF), the quantity and quality of small litterfall (LF), the standing crop of litter on the forest floor (LSC), and the annual rates of litter decay were determined over a period of 12 months in three contrasting lowland rain forest types in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. In addition, a litterbag experiment monitored the mass loss of leaves from three dominant tree species in two heath forests (HF) of contrasting stature. Soil water and shallow groundwater dynamics in the two HFs were monitored as well. LF in the LERF was higher compared to both tall heath forest (THF) and relatively stunted heath forest (SHF), but did not differ between the two HFs. Stand-level nutrient-use efficiencies for nitrogen and phosphorus were greatest for the SHF, followed by the THF and the LERF, respectively. The observed differences in nutrient-use efficiency between the two HFs did not result in different LF totals, LSC or decomposition rates and hence cannot explain the difference in HF stature. Neither could phenolic concentrations in leaf LF, which were very similar for the two HFs. Top-soil moisture levels were consistently higher in the SHF compared to the THF and never reached wilting point in either forest type whereas shallow groundwater levels in the SHF were both closer to the surface and more persistent than in the THF. Thus, severe water stress is not thought to be a factor of importance determining HF stature. Rather, considering the much lower pH of the topsoil in the SHF compared to the THF it is hypothesized that different degrees of H-toxicity to fine roots may ultimately prove responsible for the contrast in HF stature.
1468581|During a three year study (1985-1987) we used a mass balance approach to study the oxidation and reduction reactions related to decomposition of organic carbon in Mirror Lake, New Hampshire. The stoichiometry of the reactions allows us to calculate an electron transfer budget for the summer stratification period in the lake, as well as in benthic chambers and sealed jars. The average decomposition rate measured as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) production was 5.33 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. The proportions of decomposition accounted for by the various electron acceptors varied both during the summer, as well as from year to year. On average, oxygen accounted for 43% of DIC production, while the processes involving sulfate, nitrate, iron and methane formation together accounted for 20%. Despite conservative assumptions we could not account for 37% of the DIC production. The general pattern, including excess DIC production, was also observed in chamber studies conducted over shallow-water sediments and in sealed-jar experiments. Data on burial rates of reduced iron minerals indicate that such minerals are not sufficient to account for the discrepancy in the electron budget. Our analysis suggests that another electron acceptor such as organic carbon reduction, either via fermentation or selective oxidation, is the most likely explanation of excess DIC production.
20456484|Dimethyl sulphide (DMS) is a biogenic gas of climatic significance on which limited information is available from the Indian Ocean. To fill this gap, we collected data on DMS and total dimethylsulphoniopropionate (<tex-math>$\text{DMSP}_{\text{t}}$</tex-math>) by participating in a dozen cruises. Here, we discuss the variability in DMS and <tex-math>$\text{DMSP}_{\text{t}}$</tex-math> in the north and central Indian Ocean in terms of their spatial and temporal variation. DMS and <tex-math>$\text{DMSP}_{\text{t}}$</tex-math> exhibited significant spatial and temporal variability. Apart from the concentration gradients in DMS within the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Central Indian Ocean basins, differences in average abundances were conspicuous between these basins. The Arabian Sea contained more DMS (mixed layer average was 7.8 nM) followed by the Bay of Bengal (2.8 nM) and the Central Indian Ocean (2.7 nM). The highest concentrations of DMS and <tex-math>$\text{DMSP}_{\text{t}}$</tex-math> (525 nM and 916 nM, respectively) were found in upwelling regimes along the west coast of India during the Southwest monsoon and fall intermonsoon seasons. Average surface DMS was the highest in the Arabian Sea. On the other hand observed sea-to-air fluxes of DMS were higher in the Bay of Bengal due to the prevalence of turbulent conditions. In the Arabian Sea wind speeds were low and hence the sea-to-air fluxes. The total diffusive flux of DMS from the study area to atmosphere is estimated to be about 1.02  10 g S y, which contributes to 4.1-6.3% of the global DMS emission.
20456478|A two-dimensional microscale (5 cm resolution) sampler was used over the course of a phytoplankton spring bloom dominated by Phaeocystis globosa to investigate the structural properties of chlorophyll a and seawater excess viscosity distributions. The microscale distribution patterns of chlorophyll a and excess viscosity were never uniform nor random. Instead they exhibited different types and levels of aggregated spatial patterns that were related to the dynamics of the bloom. The chlorophyll a and seawater viscosity correlation patterns were also controlled by the dynamics of the bloom with positive and negative correlations before and after the formation of foam in the turbulent surf zone. The ecological relevance and implications of the observed patchiness and biologically induced increase in seawater viscosity are discussed and the combination of the enlarged colonial form and mucus secretion is suggested as a competitive advantage of P. globosa in highly turbulent environments where this species flourishes.
1469756|Changes of water table position influence carbon cycling in peatlands, but effects on the sources and sinks of carbon are difficult to isolate and quantify in field investigations due to seasonal dynamics and covariance of variables. We thus investigated carbon fluxes and dissolved carbon production in peatland mesocosms from two acidic and oligotrophic peatlands under steady state conditions at two different water table positions. Exchange rates and CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and DOC production rates were simultaneously determined in the peat from diffusive-advective mass-balances of dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and DOC in the pore water. Incubation experiments were used to quantify potential CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and DOC production rates. The carbon turnover in the saturated peat was dominated by the production of DOC (10-15 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) with lower rates of DIC (6.1-8.5 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and CH<sub>4</sub> (2.2-4.2 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) production. All production rates strongly decreased with depth indicating the importance of fresh plant tissue for dissolved C release. A lower water table decreased area based rates of photosynthesis (24-42%), CH<sub>4</sub> production (factor 2.5-3.5) and emission, increased rates of soil respiration and microbial biomass C, and did not change DOC release. Due to the changes in process rates the C net balance of the mesocosms shifted by 36 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. According to our estimates the change in C mineralization contributed most to this change. Anaerobic rates of CO<sub>2</sub> production rates deeper in the peat increased significantly by a factor of 2-3.5 (DOC), 2.9-3.9 (CO<sub>2</sub>), and 3-14 (CH<sub>4</sub>) when the water table was lowered by 30 cm. This phenomenon might have been caused by easing an inhibiting effect by the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> when the water table was at the moss surface.
41490436|The input of heavy metals by atmospheric deposition to forested watersheds substantially decreased during the last decades in many areas. The goal of our study was to identify the present sinks and sources of metals and factors influencing metal mobility at the catchment and soil profile scale. We determined concentrations and fluxes of Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni in precipitation, litterfall, soil solutions (Oi, Oe, Oa horizon percolates, 20 and 90 cm soil depth) and runoff in a forest ecosystem in NE-Bavaria, Germany for 1 year. The metal concentrations in solutions were mostly <10 g l beside Zn (<1200 g l). The present total deposition was estimated at 1.0, 560, 30, 1.2 and 10.4 g ha year for Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni, respectively. The mass balance (total deposition minus runoff) at the catchment scale indicated actual retention of Zn, Cu and Ni, but an almost balanced budget for Cr and Cd. Considering the soil profile scale, the Oi horizon still acted as a sink, whereas the Oe and Oa horizons were presently sources for all metals. The solidsolution partitioning coefficients indicated higher mobility of Cd and Zn than of Cu, Cr and Ni in forest soils. In the mineral soil horizons, k d values derived from field measurements were substantially larger than those predicted with empirical regression equations from Sauv et al. (Environ Sci Technol 34: 11251131, 2000; Environ Sci Technol 37:51915196, 2003). The mineral soil acted as a sink for all metals beside Cd. Dissolved organic C and pH influenced the metal mobility, as indicated by significant correlations to metal concentrations in Oa percolates and runoff. The solid-solution partitioning coefficients indicated higher mobility of Cd and Zn than of Cu, Cr and Ni in forest soils. Overall, the decreased deposition rates have obviously induced a source function of the Oe and Oa horizon for metals. Consequently, mobilization of metals from forest floor during heavy rain events and near surface flow conditions may lead to elevated concentrations in runoff.
1469245|The hydrochemical responses to slash-and-burn agriculture in a small rainforest catchment of the central Amazon were investigated for one year. Disturbances in the partially deforested catchment began in 1987, and during the study a 2-ha plot was cut (July 1989) and burned (October 1989) in preparation for the cultivation of manioc; the partially deforested catchment was approximately 80% deforested at the time of this study. Solute fluxes exported by base flow were estimated from solute concentrations of stream water measured at least once per week. Solute fluxes for storm flow were estimated by measuring streamwater concentrations during two storms. Baseflow runoff represented about 94% of the water outflow from the study basin and was the dominant pathway of solute export. Total rainfall during the study period was 2754 mm of which 2080 mm was exported from the partially deforested catchment as stream runoff. The ratio of surface runoff to annual rainfall for a similar study conducted in the same catchment while completely forested in 1984 was lower than after the catchment was 80% deforested in 1990 (0.57 versus 0.76), while evapotranspiration (ET) was lower by about a factor of two in 1990 compared to 1984. Particulate removal from the partially deforested catchment was 151 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Nutrient losses from the partially deforested catchment were higher than those measured when the catchment was undisturbed in 1984 by factors of 1.4, 1.8, and 2.1 for total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and total nitrogen (TN); and by factors of 4.0, 6.6, and 7.9 for soluble reactive phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. These data show that deforestation and colonization in upland catchments of the central Amazon alter the hydrochemical balance of streams by decreasing ET, thereby increasing discharge and solute export.
1468606|Depth distributions and inventories of <sup>137</sup>Cs (mCi km<sup>2</sup>) were determined in sediment from several fresh water lakes in the New York State Adirondack Preserve. Included were Big Moose and Darts Lakes, part of the North Branch of the Moose River system, as well as North, Sagamore, South, and Woods Lakes and the 'seepage pond', Tamarack Lake. Comparisons were made betwen the <sup>137</sup>Cs inventories in these lakes and large inpoundments in the Adirondacks (Hinkley, Great Sacandaga, Stillwater and Cranberry Lake Reservoirs) and other large impoundments and lakes located in various regions of the U.S., especially Cayuga Lake, Ithaca, NY. None of the Adirondack Lakes had <sup>137</sup>Cs distributions with depth in sediment that closely resembled the deposition pattern of weapons testing as a function of time. All of the natural lakes and small impoundments, including the seepage pond, were found to have significantly lower inventories of <sup>137</sup>Cs than expected; while the large reservoirs were generally enhanced in <sup>137</sup>Cs. We suggest that more than one mechanism may be responsible for the low sediment inventories: for the majority of lakes, flushing of <sup>137</sup>Cs out of the lakes during periods of thermal stratification and ice thaw; and for the seepage pond, remobilization of <sup>137</sup>Cs into the water column due to biological recycling.

1469165|Methane emissions from wetland soils are generally a positive function of plant size and primary productivity, and may be expected to increase due to enhanced rates of plant growth in a future atmosphere of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. We performed two experiments with Orontium aquaticum, a common emergent aquatic macrophyte in temperate and sub-tropical wetlands, to determine if enhanced rates of photosynthesis in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheres would increase CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from wetland soils. O. aquaticum was grown from seed in soil cores under ambient and elevated (ca. 2-times ambient) concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in an initial glasshouse study lasting 3 months and then a growth chamber study lasting 6 months. Photosynthetic rates were 54 to 71% higher under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> than ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, but plant biomass was not significantly different at the end of the experiment. In each case, CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were higher under elevated than ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels after 2 to 4 months of treatment, suggesting a close coupling between photosynthesis and methanogenesis in our plant-soil system. Methane emissions in the growth chamber study increased by 136%. We observed a significant decrease in transpiration rates under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> in the growth chamber study, and speculate that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may also stimulate CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by increasing the extent and duration of flooding in some wetland ecosystems. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may dramatically increase CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from wetlands, a source that currently accounts for 40% of global emissions.
1469121|This study examined the biotic and abiotic processes controlling solution chemistry and cycling of aluminum (Al) in the organic horizons of a northern coniferous forest ecosystem. A mass balance budget indicated that aboveground inputs of Al to the O horizon averaged 0.9 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, with major inputs accounted for by litterfall (69%), followed by precipitation (21%), and net canopy throughfall plus stemflow (10%). Estimated leaching losses of Al from the O horizon averaged 2.1 kg Al ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. We hypothesize that the difference between measured Al inputs and outputs can be accounted for by Al release from weathering of soil minerals admixed into the O horizon. Variations in O horizon solution Al chemistry were influenced by a number of factors, including pH, Al equilibria with different solid-phase organic exchange sites, and Al complexation with humic ligands in soil solution.
1469635|Increases and expansion of anthropogenic emissions of both oxidized nitrogen compounds, NO<sub>x</sub>, and a reduced nitrogen compound, NH<sub>3</sub>, have driven an increase in nitrogen deposition. We estimate global NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions and use a model of the global troposphere, MOGUNTIA, to examine the pre-industrial and contemporary quantities and spatial patterns of wet and dry NO<sub>y</sub> and NH<sub>x</sub> deposition. Pre-industrial wet plus dry NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>x</sub> deposition was greatest for tropical ecosystems, related to soil emissions, biomass burning and lightning emissions. Contemporary NO<sub>y</sub>+NH<sub>x</sub> wet and dry deposition onto Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate ecosystems averages more than four times that of pre-industrial N deposition and far exceeds contemporary tropical N deposition. All temperate and tropical biomes receive more N via deposition today than pre-industrially. Comparison of contemporary wet deposition model estimates to measurements of wet deposition reveal that modeled and measured wet deposition for both NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were quite similar over the U.S. Over Western Europe, the model tended to underestimate wet deposition of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> but bulk deposition measurements were comparable to modeled total deposition. For the U.S. and Western Europe, we also estimated N emission and deposition budgets. In the U.S., estimated emissions exceed interpolated total deposition by 3-6 Tg N, suggesting that substantial N is transported offshore and/or the remote and rural location of the sites may fail to capture the deposition of urban emissions. In Europe, by contrast, interpolated total N deposition balances estimated emissions within the uncertainty of each.
23359705|Subsurface waters over the western Indian continental shelf experience seasonal anoxia towards the end of the southwest monsoon season. During a 3-day study carried out at the Candolim time series site (off the coast of Goa), dimethylsulphide (DMS) concentrations showed a 40-fold increase to a maximum of 442 nM at 25 m depth compared to the oxygenated surface waters. This extremely high DMS was found to be associated with relatively low chlorophyll a, low phytoplankton cell counts and a high concentration of hydrogen sulphide. However, total dimethylsulphoniopropionate, total dimethylsulphoxide and methanethiol concentrations were quite low and unlikely to account for the DMS build-up through presently known pathways of DMS production. While there are several possible mechanisms for the observed accumulation of DMS, we were unable to pinpoint the exact pathway of DMS production. Future work will involve investigation of the source of DMS through sediment slurry experiments, to explore this interesting link between the carbon and sulphur cycles under anoxic conditions.
24715206|This study aims to investigate the role of spatial and temporal physical, biological and biogeochemical gradients on sediment biogeochemistry along a macrotidal and Si-rich estuary. Scanning and biogeochemical analyses were performed in the inner, mid and outer Aulne Estuary (France) at four seasons. The inner estuary shows high diagenetic activity linked to fluid mud dynamics and river loads. The highest authigenic phosphorus (Aut-P) concentrations ever found in the literature are observed in the inner estuary (18 mol g PS sediment). This is explained by a combination of favorable factors, i.e. the high organic matter and nutrient loads, the reductive conditions, the freshwater properties (low pH, OH, sulfate and Mg concentrations), the increase of particle residence time by the upward convergence of particles due to residual currents, and allochthonous riverine Aut-P. We suggest that the high Si(OH) concentrations (>400 M) may even increase Aut-P precipitation through the increase of FeP formation in these low salinity conditions. In the mid estuary, erosiondeposition dynamics dominate in point bars and lead to the succession of poor and rich organic and authigenic phosphorus layers, recording thus the seasonality of matter loads and its seasonal translocation from the inner estuary. In the outer estuary, deposition rates are high and constant and biogeochemical properties are characteristic of marine environments. The precipitation of Aut-P from free phosphate (PO) is lower than in the inner estuary and might be limited by higher Mg concentrations in saline waters. This study highlights that small macrotidal estuaries, and especially their freshwater sediments, may constitute an important phosphorus sink through the precipitation of Aut-P. This precipitation could even be enhanced in fresh or brackish environments, thus increasing long term phosphorus storage and altering benthic fluxes of PO to the pelagic ecosystem.
24715365|It is anticipated that a lowering of the water table and reduced soil moisture levels in peatlands may increase peat decomposition rates and consequently affect nutrient availability. However, it is not clear if patterns will be consistent across different peatland types or within peatlands given the natural range of ecohydrological conditions within these systems. We examined the effect of persistent drought on peatland nutrient dynamics by quantifying the effects of an experimentally lowered water table position (drained for a 10-year period) on peat KCl-extractable total inorganic nitrogen (ext-TIN), peat KCl-extractable nitrate (ext-NO), and water-extractable ortho-phosphorus (ext-PO) concentrations and net phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification rates at natural (control) and drained microforms (hummocks, lawns) of a bog and poor fen near Qubec City, Canada. Drainage (water table drawdown) decreased net nitrification rates across the landscape and increased ext-NO concentrations, but did not affect net N and P mineralization rates or ext-TIN and ext-PO concentrations. We suggest that the thick capillary fringe at the drained peatland likely maintained sufficient moisture above the water table to limit the effects of drainage on microbial activity, and a 20 cm lowering of the water table does not appear to have been sufficient to create a clear difference in nutrient dynamics in this peatland landscape. We found some evidence of differences in nutrient concentrations with microforms, where concentrations were greater in lawn than hummock microforms at control sites indicating some translocation of nutrients. In general, the same microtopographic differences were not observed at drained sites. The general spatial patterns in nutrient concentrations did not reflect net mineralization/immobilization rates measured at our control or drained peatlands. Rather, the spatial patterns in nutrient availability may be regulated by differences in vegetation (mainly Sphagnum moss) cover between control and drained sites and possibly differences in hydrologic connection between microforms. Our results suggest that microform distribution and composition within a peatland may be important for determining how peatland nutrient dynamics will respond to water table drawdown in northern peatlands, as some evidence of microtopographic differences in nutrient dynamics was found.
20456472|Interpretation of photosynthetic pigment data using iterative programs such as CHEMTAX are widely used to examine algal community structure in the surface ocean. The accuracy of such programs relies on understanding the effects of environmental parameters on the pigment composition of taxonomically diverse algal groups. Phaeocystis antarctica is an important contributor to total autotrophic production and the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and sulfur in the Southern Ocean. Here we report the results of a laboratory culture experiment in which we examined the effects of ambient dissolved iron concentration on the pigment composition of colonial P. antarctica, using a new P. antarctica strain isolated from the southern Ross Sea in December 2003. Low-iron (&lt;0.2 nM dissolved Fe) filtered Ross Sea seawater was used to prepare the growth media, thus allowing subnanomolar iron additions without the use of EDTA to control dissolved iron concentrations. The experiment was conducted at relatively low irradiance (20 E m s), with P. antarctica primarily present in the colonial form--conditions that are typical of the southern Ross Sea during austral spring. Relative to the iron-limited control treatments (0.22 nM dissolved Fe), iron addition mediated a decrease in the ratio of 19-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin to chlorophyll a, and an increase in the ratio of fucoxanthin to chlorophyll a. Our results also suggest that the ratio of 19-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin to chlorophyll c (Hex:Chl c ratio) may be a characteristic physiological indicator for the iron-nutritional status of colonial P. antarctica, with higher Hex:Chl c ratios (&gt;3) indicative of Fe stress. We also observed that the ratio of fucoxanthin to 19-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (Fuco:Hex ratio) was highly correlated (r = 0.82) with initial dissolved Fe concentration, with Fuco:Hex ratios &lt;0.05 measured under iron-limited conditions (dissolved Fe &lt;0.45 nM). Our results corroborate and extend the results of previous experimental studies, and, combined with pigment measurements from the southern Ross Sea, are consistent with the hypothesis that the interconversion of fucoxanthin and 19-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin by colonial P. antarctica is used as a photo-protective or light-harvesting mechanism, according to the availability of dissolved iron.
1469763| A synthesis of the biogeochemistry of S was done during 34 yr (1964-1965 to 1997-1998) in reference and human-manipulated forest ecosystems of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH. There have been significant declines in concentration (-0.44 mol/liter-yr) and input (-5.44 mol/ha-yr) of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in atmospheric bulk wet deposition, and in concentration (-0.64 mol/liter-yr) an d output (-3.74 mol/ha-yr) of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in stream water of the HBEF since 1964. These changes are strongly correlated with concurrent decreases in emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> from the source area for the HBEF. The concentration and input of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in bulk deposition ranged from a low of 13.1 mol/liter (1983-1984) and 211 mol/ha-yr (1997-1998) to a high of 34.7 mol/liter (1965-1966) and 479 mol/ha-yr (1967-1968), with a long-term mean of 23.9 mol/liter and 336 mol/ha-yr during 1964-1965 to 1997-1998. Despite recent declines in concentrations, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is the dominant anion in both bulk deposition and stream water at HBEF. Dry deposition is difficult to measure, especially in mountainous terrain, but was estimated at 21% of bulk deposition. Thus, average total atmospheric deposition was 491 and 323 mol/ha-yr during 1964-1969 and 1993-1998, respectively. Based on the long-term  <sup>34</sup>S pattern associated with anthropogenic emissions, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> deposition at HBEF is influenced by numerous SO<sub>2</sub> sources, but biogenic sources appear to be small. Annual throughfall plus stemflow in 1993-1994 was estimated at 346 mol SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/ha. Aboveground litterfall, for the watershed-ecosystem averaged about 180 mol S/ha-yr, with highest inputs (190 mol S/ha-yr) in the lower elevation, more deciduous forest zone. Weathering release was calculated at a maximum of 50 mol S/ha-yr. The concentration and output of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in stream water ranged from a low of 42.3 mol/liter (1996-1997) and 309 mol/ha-yr (1964-1965), to a high of 66.1 mol/liter (1970-1971) and 849 mol/ha-yr (1973-1974), with a long-term mean of 55.5 mol/liter and 496 mol/ha-yr during the 34 yrs of study. Gross outputs of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in stream water consistently exceeded inputs in bulk deposition and were positively and significantly related to annual precipitation and streamflow. The relation between gross SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> output and annual streamflow changed with time as atmospheric inputs declined. In contrast to the pattern for bulk deposition concentration, there was no seasonal pattern for stream SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration. Nevertheless, stream outputs of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were highly seasonal, peaking during spring snowmelt, and producing a monthly cross-over pattern where net hydrologic flux (NHF) is positive during summer and negative during the remainder of the year. No significant elevational pattern in streamwater SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration was observed. Mean annual, volume-weighted soil water SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations were relatively uniform by soil horizon and across landscape position. Based upon isotopic evidence, much of the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> entering HBEF in atmospheric deposition cycles through vegetation and microbial biomass before being released to the soil solution and stream water. Gaseous emissions of S from watershed-ecosystems at HBEF are unquantified, but estimated to be very small. Organic S (carbon bonded and ester sulfates) represents some 89% of the total S in soil at HBEF. Some 6% exists as phosphate extractable SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> (PSO<sub>4</sub>). About 73% of the total S in the soil profile at HBEF occurs in the Bs2 horizon, and some 9% occurs in the forest floor. The residence time for S in the soil was calculated to be 9 yr, but only a small portion of the total organic soil pool turns over relatively quickly. The S content of above- and belowground biomass is about 2885 mol/ha, of which some 3-5% is in standing dead trees. Yellow birch, American beech and sugar maple accounted for 89% of the S in trees, with 31% in branches, 27% in roots and 25% in the lightwood of boles. The pool of S in living biomass increased from 1965 to 1982 due to biomass accretion, and remained relatively constant thereafter. Of current inputs to the available nutrient compartment of the forest ecosystem, 50% is from atmospheric bulk deposition, 24% from net soil release, 11% from dry deposition, 11% from root exudates and 4% is from canopy leaching. Comparing ecosystem processes for S from 1964-1969 to 1993-1998, atmospheric bulk deposition decreased by 34%, stream output decreased by 10%, net annual biomass storage decreased by 92%, and net soil release increased by 184% compared to the 1964-1969 values. These changes are correlated with decreased emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> from the source area for the HBEF. Average, annual bulk deposition inputs exceeded streamwater outputs by 160.0  75.3 SD mol S/ha-yr, but average annual net ecosystem fluxes (NEF) were much smaller, mostly negative and highly variable during the 34 yr period (-54.3  72.9 SD mol S/ha-yr; NEF range, +86.8 to -229.5). While several mechanisms may explain this small discrepancy, the most likely are net desorption of S and net mineralization of organic S largely associated with the forest floor. Our best estimates indicate that additional S from dry deposition and weathering release is probably small and that desorption accounts for about 37% of the NEF imbalance and net mineralization probably accounts for the remainder (60%). Additional inputs from dry deposition would result from unmeasured inputs of gaseous and particulate deposition directly to the forest floor. The source of any unmeasured S input has important implications for the recovery of soils and streams in response to decreases in inputs of acidic deposition. Sulfate is a dominant contributor to acid deposition at HBEF, seriously degrading aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Because of the strong relation between SO<sub>2</sub> emissions and concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in both atmospheric deposition and stream water at HBEF, further reductions in SO<sub>2</sub> emissions will be required to allow significant ecosystem recovery from the effects of acidic deposition. The destruction or removal of vegetation on experimental watershed-ecosystems at HBEF resulted in increased rates of organic matter decomposition and nitrification, a lowering of soil and streamwater pH, enhanced SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption on mineral soil and smaller concentrations and losses of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in stream water. With vegetation regrowth, this adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is released from the soil, increasing concentrations and fluxes of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in drainage water. Streamwater concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and gross annual output of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/ha are essentially the same throughout the Hubbard Brook Valley in watersheds varying in size by about 4 orders of magnitude, from 3 to 3000 ha. 
41410564|Small streams that drain agricultural landscapes have come under close scrutiny as potentially significant indirect sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. By exploring the streamground water connection in three dimensional space (horizontally and vertically beneath the stream channel, and longitudinally along the stream corridor) our results show (1) ground water can be a significant source of greenhouse gases to streams draining agricultural watersheds with concentrations in excess of atmospheric equilibrium by 221 mol C L carbon dioxide, 0.64 MOL C L methane, and 0.65 mol N L nitrous oxide (NO); (2) changes in the stream-ground water connection can create seemingly erratic patterns in GHG concentrations over short longitudinal distances (order of meters); (3) soil-stream interfaces are hotspots for denitrification and methanogenesis; however, no significant NO production was observed at such an interface under a riparian forest; and (4) nitrate (NO) and NO can be preserved as electron acceptors in oxic ground waters draining agriculture landscapes; hence, soil nitrification was the major source of NO to stream water, with a legacy in ground water dating back to the 1960s; NO tracked the seepage of NO into surface waters. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of detailed measurements of multiple trace gases towards revealing spatial and temporal patterns of surface-ground water interactions and biogeochemistry across several small baseflow-dominated stream ecosystems in central Wisconsin, USA.
20456439|This study compares approximately weekly soil respiration across two forest--pasture pairs with similar soil, topography and climate to document how conversion of pasture to forest alters net soil CO respiration. Over the 2.5 year period of the study, we found that soil respiration was reduced by an average of 41% with conversion of pasture to forest on an annual basis. Both pastured sites showed similar annual soil respiration rates. Comparisons of the paired forests, one coniferous and the other broadleaf, only showed a significant difference over one annual cycle. Enhanced soil respiration in pastures may be the result of either enhanced root respiration and/or microbial respiration. Differences in pasture--forest soil respiration were primarily observed during the July through September summer period at all sites, suggesting that this is the critical period for observing and documenting differences. Evaluation of the soil microclimatic controls on soil respiration suggest that soil temperature exerts a major control on this process, and that examining these relationships on a seasonal rather than weekly basis provides the strongest relationships in poorly drained soils. Consistently greater pastured site <tex-math>$Q_{10}\text{s}\ (2.52;2.42)$</tex-math> than forested site <tex-math>$Q_{10}\text{s}\ (2.27;2.17)$</tex-math> were observed, with paired-site differences of 0.25.
1469510| This study focused on organic particles with respect to their transport and sedimentary mineralisation in a North Sea intertidal sandflat previously characterised as strongly influenced by advective transport across and below the water-sediment interface. Measured permeabilities of the sandy sediment ranged from 5.5 to 41.10<sup>-12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>, and permeabilities calculated from granulometric data exceeded the measured values by a factor of 4.4  2.8. Bacteria (2-9% of the POC) were highly variable in space and time. They were less mobile than interstitial fine (< 70 m) organic and inorganic particles, as part of the population lived attached to large, heavy sand grains. The vertical distribution of bacteria was closely related to the organic carbon content of the fine-grained interstitial material. In winter, bacterial numbers in the uppermost 5 cm amounted to 39-69% of the summer ones. Carbon mineralisation rates ranged between 20 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in winter and 580 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in summer, keeping step with finer-grained sediments that contained an order of magnitude more organic carbon. Sedimentary carbohydrates were mainly intracellular or tightly bound to particles, and their concentrations were depth-invariant in winter, but exponentially decreasing with depth in summer. Below 5 cm depth, the mean concentration was (1590  830) g cm<sup>-3</sup>, without major downcore or seasonal changes. Phytobenthos and phytodetritus were dominated by diatoms and comprised merely minor amounts of other primary producers. Planktonic diatom depth profiles were related to weather and phytoplankton conditions, and benthic diatoms showed similar depth distributions due to passive and active motion. The penetration of relatively fresh phytodetritus down to at least 5 cm, shown by chloropigment composition, emphasised the close coupling between water column and sandy sediment, facilitated by advective interfacial and subsurface flows. 
40343609|This study examined changes in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in coastal seawater after exposure to sand along a high energy beach face over an annual cycle between April 2004 and July 2005. Dissolved organic nitrogen, NO, and NH were released from sand to seawater in laboratory incubation experiments clearly demonstrating that they are a potential source of N to underlying groundwater or coastal seawater. DON increases in seawater, after exposure to surface sands in laboratory experiments, were positively correlated with in situ water column DON concentrations measured at the same time as sand collection. Increase in NO and NH were not correlated with their in situ concentrations. This suggests that DON released from beach sands is relatively more recalcitrant while NO and NH are utilized rapidly in the coastal ocean. The release of N was seasonal with carbon to nitrogen ratios indicating that recent primary productivity was responsible for the largest fluxes in summer while more degraded humic material contributed to lower fluxes in winter. Fluxes of total dissolved nitrogen (DON and DIN) from surface sand (2.1 x 10 mol m h) were similar to that of groundwater and more than an order of magnitude larger than rain deposition indicating the potential importance of surface sand derived nitrogen to the coastal zone with a corresponding impact on primary productivity.
1468568|The process of dissolved phosphate removal from aqueous solution, which occurs during oxidation of soluble ferrous compounds to insoluble ferric forms, was examined in soils of two tidal freshwater marshes. Sites of amorphous iron deposition and sorption or co-precipitation of phosphate were found to be in surface soils and along creekbanks, where both ion diffusion and porewater advection move dissolved iron and phosphate from reduced to oxidized regions. Profiles of extractable iron and total phosphorus from creekbank and interior soils were consistent with hypothesized differences between a high and a low marsh. Porewater concentrations of dissolved phosphate were higher in creekbank soils of the high marsh, compared with water actually discharging from the creekbank during tidal exposure. We propose that an iron curtain of ferric hydroxides functions as a barrier to diffusive and advective movement of dissolved phosphate along surfaces of tidal freshwater marshes, and has important implications for the distribution and availability of phosphorus in other types of wetlands and aqueous systems.
41490438|We measured net nitrate retention by mass balance in a 700-m upwelling reach of a third-order sand plains stream, Emmons Creek, from January 2007 to November 2008. Surface water and groundwater fluxes of nitrate were determined from continuous records of discharge and from nitrate concentrations based on weekly and biweekly sampling at three surface water stations and in 23 in-stream piezometers, respectively. Surface water nitrate concentration in Emmons Creek was relatively high (mean of 2.25 mg NON l) and exhibited strong seasonal variation. Net nitrate retention averaged 429 mg NON m d and about 2% of nitrate inputs to the reach. Net nitrate retention was highest during the spring and autumn when groundwater discharge was elevated. Groundwater discharge explained 5765% of the variation in areal net nitrate retention. Specific discharge and groundwater nitrate concentration varied spatially. Weighting groundwater solute concentrations by specific discharge improved the water balance and resulted in higher estimates of nitrate retention. Our results suggest that groundwater inputs of nitrate can drive nitrate retention in streams with high groundwater discharge.
24715092|Nearly all freshwaters and coastal zones of the US are degraded from inputs of excess reactive nitrogen (Nr), sources of which are runoff, atmospheric N deposition, and imported food and feed. Some major adverse effects include harmful algal blooms, hypoxia of fresh and coastal waters, ocean acidification, long-term harm to human health, and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. Nitrogen fluxes to coastal areas and emissions of nitrous oxide from waters have increased in response to N inputs. Denitrification and sedimentation of organic N to sediments are important processes that divert N from downstream transport. Aquatic ecosystems are particularly important denitrification hotspots. Carbon storage in sediments is enhanced by Nr, but whether carbon is permanently buried is unknown. The effect of climate change on N transport and processing in fresh and coastal waters will be felt most strongly through changes to the hydrologic cycle, whereas N loading is mostly climate-independent. Alterations in precipitation amount and dynamics will alter runoff, thereby influencing both rates of Nr inputs to aquatic ecosystems and groundwater and the water residence times that affect Nr removal within aquatic systems. Both infrastructure and climate change alter the landscape connectivity and hydrologic residence time that are essential to denitrification. While Nr inputs to and removal rates from aquatic systems are influenced by climate and management, reduction of N inputs from their source will be the most effective means to prevent or to minimize environmental and economic impacts of excess Nr to the nation's water resources.
1469758|Acid deposition over time scales of decades may deplete essential base cation (BC) reserves in soils to the extent that forest health may be affected. In order to assess the nutrient status of soils in central Ontario, input-output budgets for calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) were calculated over a 17-year period (1983-1999) for a coniferous catchment in the Muskoka-Haliburton region. Inputs through deposition and weathering (BCs only), were compared with outputs through stream export and net accumulation in forest biomass. Despite a lack of forest growth at PC1, annual NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations in the stream were low (<0.1 mg/l) over the 17-year period, and over 80% of the atmospheric N input was retained in the catchment, indicating this catchment has not reached N-saturation. Stream export of Mg, and in particular Ca, exceeded input of these elements through deposition and weathering, indicating a net loss from the catchment over the 17-year period. Mass balance calculations indicated there was no net loss of K from the catchment. Soil re-sampling measurements confirmed large losses of Ca, but not Mg, and there were significant decreases in both NaCl-exchangeable Ca concentrations and soil pH between 1983 and 1999. The measured decline in soil Ca concentration amounted to a loss of approximately 85 kg/ha Ca from the exchangeable pool over the 17-year period. Similarly, input-output budget calculations indicated a net loss of Ca from the catchment in the range of 76 to 88 kg/ha between 1983 and 1999. Although the magnitude of Ca export decreased over the 17-year period, current stream export continues to exceed Ca input through deposition and weathering.
1469737| Nitrogen budgets established for large river systems reveal that up to 60% of the nitrate exported from agricultural soils is eliminated, either when crossing riparian wetlands areas before even reaching surface waters, or within the rivers themselves through benthic denitrification. The study of nitrogen isotope ratios of riverine nitrates could offer an elegant means to assess the extent of denitrification and thus confirm these budgets, as it is known that denitrification results in a natural <sup>15</sup>N enrichment of residual nitrates. The results reported here, for the Seine river system (France), demonstrate the feasibility of this isotopic approach at the scale of large watersheds. On the basis of in situ observations carried out in a large storage reservoir in the upstream Seine catchment (Der Lake), where intensive benthic denitrification occurs, as well as on the basis of laboratory experiments of denitrification under controlled conditions, it is shown that the isotopic discrimination associated with benthic denitrification is minimal ( of NO<sub>3</sub>-N ranging from -1.5 to -3.6), probably because the rate-limiting step of the process consists of nitrate diffusion through the water-sediment interface. Riparian denitrification on the contrary, when it implies nitrate reduction during convective transfer through reducing environements, causes a much more significant isotopic enrichment of <sup>15</sup>N of residual nitrate ( about -18). The authors report measurements of nitrogen isotopic composition of nitrate from rivers of various stream orders in the Seine river system under summer conditions. Anomalies in the data with respect to the values expected from the mixture of the various sources of nitrate are here attributed to riparian denitrification. However, the authors show that because of the patchy distribution of actively denitrifying riparian zones within the drainage network, the isotopic signature conferred to residual nitrate in river water intrinsically provides only a minimum estimate of the extent of denitrification. 
1469482|Models of the effects of atmospheric N deposition in forested watersheds have not adequately accounted for the effects of aquatic and near-stream processes on the concentrations and loads of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in surface waters. This study compared the relative effects of aquatic and near-stream processes with those from the terrestrial ecosystem on the retention and transport of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in two contrasting stream reaches of the Neversink River, a forested watershed in the Catskill Mountains of New York that receives among the highest load of atmospheric N deposition in the northeastern United States. Stream water samples were collected every two hours and ground-water and tributary samples were collected daily at base flow conditions during four 48-hour periods from April to October 1992, and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> mass balances were calculated for each site. Results indicated diurnal variations in stream NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in both reaches during all four sampling periods; this is consistent with uptake of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by photoautotrophs during daylight hours. Mass-balance results revealed significant stream reach losses of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> at both sites during all sampling periods. The diurnal variations in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations and the retention of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> relative to terrestrial contributions to the stream reaches were greater downstream than upstream because physical factors such as the head gradients of inflowing ground water and the organic matter content of sediment are more favorable to uptake and denitrification downstream. The mass retention of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> increased as the mean 48-hr stream discharge increased at each site, indicating that the responsible processes are dependent on NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> supply. Low stream temperatures during the April sampling period, however, probably reduced the rate of retention processes, resulting in smaller losses of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> than predicted from stream discharge alone. Water samples collected from the stream, the hyporheic zone, and the alluvial ground water at sites in both reaches indicated that the net effect of hyporheic processes on downstream NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transport ranged from conservative mixing to complete removal by denitrification. The relative effects of biological uptake and denitrification as retention mechanisms could not be quantified, but the results indicate that both processes are significant. These results generally confirm that aquatic and near-stream processes cause significant losses of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the Neversink River, and that the losses by these processes at downstream locations can exceed the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> contributions to the stream from the terrestrial environment during summer and fall base-flow conditions. Failure to consider these aquatic and near-stream processes in models of watershed response to atmospheric N deposition could result in underestimates of the amount of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> leaching from forested ecosystems and to an inability to unequivocally relate geographic differences in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations of stream waters to corresponding differences in terrestrial processes.
1469360| This study presents a comprehensive analysis of nitrogen (N) cycling in a second-order forested stream in southern Michigan that has moderately high concentrations of ammonium (mean, 16 g N/L) and nitrate (17 g N/L). A whole-stream <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> addition was performed for 6 weeks in June and July, and the tracer <sup>15</sup>N was measured downstream in ammonium, nitrate, and detrital and living biomass. Ancillary measurements included biomass of organic matter, algae, bacteria and fungi, nutrient concentrations, hydraulic characteristics, whole-stream metabolism, and nutrient limitation assays. The results provide insights into the heterotrophic nature of woodland streams and reveal the rates at which biological processes alter nitrogen transport through stream systems. Ammonium uptake lengths were 766-1349 m and uptake rates were 41-60 g N m<sup>-2</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>. Nitrate uptake could not be detected. Nitrification rates were estimated from the downstream increase in <sup>15</sup>N-enriched nitrate using a simulation model. The ammonium was removed by nitrification (57% of total uptake), heterotrophic bacteria and fungi associated with detritus (29%), and epilithic algae (14%). Growth of algae was likely limited by light rather than nutrients, and dissolved O<sub>2</sub> revealed that the stream metabolism was heterotrophic overall (P:R = 0.2). Incubations of detritus in darkened chambers showed that uptake of <sup>15</sup>N was mostly heterotrophic. Microbial N in detritus and algal N in epilithon appeared to reach isotopic steady state with the dissolved ammonium, but the isotopic enrichment of the bulk detritus and epilithon did not approach that of ammonium, probably due to a large fraction of organic N in the bulk samples that was not turning over. The actively cycling fraction of total N in organic compartments was estimated from the isotopic enrichment, assuming uptake of ammonium but not nitrate, to be 23% for epilithon, 1% for fine benthic organic matter, 5% for small woody debris, and 7% for leaves. These percentages agree with independent estimates of epilithic algal biomass, which were based on carbon:chlorophyll ratios in bulk samples and in algal fractions separated by density-gradient centrifugation in colloidal silica, and of microbial N in the detritus, which were based on N released by chloroform fumigations. 
24715187|Tropical wetlands are typically productive ecosystems that can introduce large amounts of carbon into the soil. However, high temperatures and seasonal water availability can hinder the ability of wetland soils to sequester carbon efficiently. We determined the carbon sequestration rate of 12 wetland communities in four different tropical wetlandsan isolated depressional wetland in a rainforest, and a slow flowing rainforest swamp, a riverine flow-through wetland with a marked wet and dry season, a seasonal floodplain of an inland deltawith the intention of finding conditions that favor soil carbon accumulation in tropical wetlands. Triplicate soil cores were extracted in these communities and analyzed for total carbon content to determine the wetland soil carbon pool. We found that the humid tropic wetlands had greater carbon content (P  0.05) than the tropical dry ones (96.5 and 34.8 g C kg, respectively). While the dry tropic wetlands had similar sequestration rates (63  10 g Cm y on average), the humid tropic ones differed significantly (P < 0.001), with high rates in a slow-flowing slough (306  77 g Cm y) and low rates in a tropical rain forest depressional wetland (84  23 g Cm y). The carbon accumulating in all of these wetlands was mostly organic (92100%). These results suggest the importance of differentiating between types of wetland communities and their hydrology when estimating overall rates at which tropical wetlands sequester carbon, and the need to include tropical wetland carbon sequestration in global carbon budgets.
23359737|The Kobresia pastures of the Tibetan Plateau represent the world's largest alpine grassland ecosystem. These pastures remained stable during the last millennia of nomadic animal husbandry. However, strongly increased herds' density has promoted overgrazing, with unclear consequences for vegetation and soils, particularly for cycles of carbon (C), nutrients and water. Vegetation-free patches of dead root-mat covered by blue-green algae and crustose lichens (crusts) are common in overgrazed Kobresia pastures, but their effect on C turnover processes is completely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the crusts strongly affect the C cycle by examining: (i) the long-term C stock measured as soil organic matter content; (ii) medium-term C stock as dead roots; (iii) recent C fluxes analyzed as living roots and CO2 efflux; and (iv) fast decomposition of root exudates. Up to 7.5 times less aboveground and 1.9 times less belowground living biomass were found in crust patches, reflecting a much smaller C input to soil as compared with the non-crust Kobresia patches. A lower C input initially changed the long-term C stock under crusts in the upper root-mat horizon. Linear regression between living roots and CO 2 efflux showed that roots contributed 23% to total CO 2 under non-crust areas (mean JulyAugust 5.4 g C m -2 day -1 ) and 18% under crusts (5.1 g C m -2 day -1 ). To identify differences in the fast turnover processes in soil, we added 13 C labeled glucose, glycine and acetic acid, representing the three main groups of root exudates. The decomposition rates of glucose (0.7 day -1 ), glycine (1.5 day -1 ) and acetic acid (1.2 day -1 ) did not differ under crusts and non-crusts. More 13 C, however, remained in soil under crusts, reflecting less complete decomposition of exudates and less root uptake. This shows that the crust patches decrease the rates of medium-term C turnover in response to the much lower C input. Very high 13 C amounts recovered in plants from non-crust areas as well as the two times lower uptake by roots under crusts indicate that very dense roots are efficient competitors with microorganisms for soluble organics. In conclusion, the altered C cycle in the overgrazing-induced crustose lichens and blue-green algae crusts is connected with strongly decreased C input and reduced medium-term C turnover.
20519798|Streamwater chemistry was measured at 100-m intervals in all streams of the Hubbard Brook Valley, NH during 'spring' (May-July) and during 'fall' (October-December) 2001. Overall, streamwater chemistry was very similar during these two periods, but fall median concentrations were consistently higher than spring values, except for ANC, pH, NO and PO, which had lower values in fall. Median concentrations for NH were approximately the same in spring and fall. Stream chemistry varied throughout the Hubbard Brook Valley by elevation, channel length, drainage area and type of drainage, but most of the variability in stream chemistry was subtle and relatively small. Overall, there were relatively large (two- to 10-fold) changes in chemistry with longitudinal distance of wetted channel, elevation and/or size of drainage area in some streams and for some elements (e.g., H,
1469280|Native prairie and grassland soils are known to accumulate little inorganic N; however, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is constantly being formed and re-immobilized. This suggests that microorganisms in prairie soils would be highly efficient in the assimilation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and would regularly have the assimilatory NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reductase (ANR) enzyme in an induced and active state. Aerated slurries and static systems prepared from prairie and cultivated soils amended with glucose and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were observed for changes in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration with time. Nitrate assimilation in the presence of glucose occurred more rapidly in cultivated than in prairie soils from the same soil map unit. Nitrate assimilation rates were not affected by inoculation of prairie soil with cultivated soil. It has been reported that the addition of glucose and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to soils results in increased peptidase activity and a release of free amino acids. Mixing, sieving, and slurrying of prairie soils followed by treatment with glucose and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> may release free amino acids and other ANR inhibitors into the prairie soil slurries. Prairie soils had higher concentrations of soluble amino-N than cultivated soils with or without glucose and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> additions. Prairie soils also had greater concentrations of total Kjeldahl N and readily hydrolyzed amino acids than corresponding cultivated soils.
1469497| Mercury evasion from water is commonly modeled using measurements of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM). We developed a method using a recently available automated field-ready mercury vapor analyzer to rapidly measure the concentrations of DGM in surface waters. We summarize here results of laboratory tests of the method, field intercomparisons with a manual method, and selected data from recent sampling campaigns in Florida and Michigan. The method uses the 1.5 1pm flow of a Tekran Model 2537 A mercury analyzer to purge and analyze discrete water samples, generating near real time (5-min) data on DGM in samples and blanks. Application of the Tekran allowed for detailed analysis of DGM removal kinetics and short-term diel studies characterizing the influence of sunlight and precipitation on DGM production in surface waters. Gas removal kinetics for dozens of samples indicates a first-order rate constant, and supports a 20-min. purge time for surface water samples from Florida (40-min for Michigan samples). Blanks are measured during a second such purge. Our results indicate that DGMs determined by both automated and manual methods are generally comparable, and that DGM in Florida samples is unstable during storage (loss rate constant  0.1-0.2 h<sup>-1</sup>), probably due to oxidation. This suggests that rapid in-field analysis is preferred to storage with delayed analysis. Our data indicate that DGM at the Florida site is influenced by inputs of reactive Hg in rainwater, and by production of surface DGM during photoreduction of oxidized Hg in the water column. 
20456547|Although phosphate concentrations have been reduced, the rivers Meuse and Rhine are still polluted with sulphate, which most probably affects vegetation development in newly created riverine wetlands. The influence of flooding with river water rich in sulphate was tested on three soil types from floodplains of the river Meuse using flow-through and batch experiments. Soils were selected for contrasting concentrations of iron and organic matter and originated from a floating fen (iron-poor, organic), an alder carr (iron-rich, organic) and a clay pit (iron-rich, low in organic matter). Flooding induced mobilisation of phosphate. Sulphate only enhanced this effect in the alder carr soil, where sulphide and phosphate competed for binding to iron. Only in the floating fen soil did the addition of sulphate result in the formation of free sulphide, which reduced the growth of Glyceria maxima, serving as a phytometer. In addition, the floating soil started to sink, due to falling methane concentrations. In the different soil types methane production was hampered by the presence of more favourable electron acceptors such as sulphate in the water and Fe(III) in the soil. It was concluded that the effects of inundation with sulphate-polluted water strongly depend on the soil type: under iron-poor circumstances, free sulphide may accumulate, leading to phytotoxicity, while in soils rich in iron, sulphide toxicity is prevented, but phosphate availability may be increased. In addition, shortage of easily degradable organic matter can limit the formation of potential toxicants such as ammonium, iron and sulphide. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for nature management.
20055266|A field study was conducted in a nutrient-impacted marsh in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A) of the Everglades in southern Florida, USA, to evaluate early stages of plant litter (detritus) decomposition along a well-documented trophic gradient, and to determine the relative importance of environmental factors and substrate composition in governing decomposition rate. Vertically stratified decomposition chambers containing native plant litter (cattail and sawgrass leaves) were placed in the soil and water column along a 10-km transect coinciding with a gradient of soil phosphorus (P) enrichment. Decomposition rate varied significantly along the vertical water-soil profile, with rates typically higher in the water column and litter layer than below the soil surface, presumably in response to vertical gradients of such environmental factors as O and nutrient availability. An overall decrease in decomposition rate occurred along the soil P gradient (from high- to low-impact). First-order rate constant (k) values for decomposition ranged from
40343643|Dissolved methane (CH) was measured in the waters of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary and its adjacent marine area during five surveys from 2002 to 2006. Dissolved CH concentrations ranged from 2.71 to 89.2 nM and had seasonal variation with the highest values occurring in summer and lowest in autumn. The horizontal distribution of dissolved CH decreased along the freshwater plume from the river mouth to the open sea. Dissolved CH in surface waters of the Changjiang was observed monthly at the most downstream main channel station Xuliujing (1212'E, 3146'N), which ranged from 16.2 to 126.2 nM with an average of 71.6  36.3 nM. The average annual input of CH from the Changjiang to the Estuary and its adjacent area was estimated to be 2.24 mol s equal to 70.6  10 mol year . Mean CH emission rate from the sediments of the Changjiang Estuary in spring was 1.97 m day, but it may be higher in summer due to hypoxia in the bottom waters and higher temperatures. The annual sea to air CH fluxes from the Changjiang Estuary and its adjacent marine area were estimated to be 61.4  22.6 and 16.0  6.1 mol m day , respectively, using three different gas exchange models. Hence the Changjiang Estuary and its adjacent marine area are net sources of atmospheric CH
20456436|The differential impact of microbial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis on the mineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC) in warm monomictic Lake Kinneret (LK), Israel was studied during three consecutive lake cycles. The hypolimnetic accumulation of total sulfide and dissolved methane was examined in relation to the physical forcing of the water column and the settling flux of particulate matter. With the on-set of thermal stratification in spring, both solutes increased concomitantly with the depletion of oxygen, first in the benthic boundary layer, followed by the upper hypolimnion. Methane production was restricted to the sediments as emphasized by the persistently linear concentration gradient in the hypolimnion. Sulfate reduction occurred both in the sediments and the water column as revealed by the hypolimnetic distribution of sulfide and recurring metalimnetic sulfide peaks. Annual differences in the accumulation pattern of both solutes appeared to be primarily linked to the settling flux of POC and the length of the stratified season. Relatively lower hypolimnetic concentrations of dissolved methane during the stratified season of 2000 coincided with increased ebullition of gaseous methane, likely as the result of a nearly a 2 m drop in the lake level. Overall, sulfate reduction accounted for more than 60% of the POC settling flux, a finding that differs from similar studies made in temperate lakes where methanogenesis was shown to be the primary mode of terminal carbon mineralization. Intensive organic carbon turnover at the sediment water interface and comparatively high sulfate concentrations in LK are the most likely reason.
1469915|Human activity has substantially increased atmospheric NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition in many regions of the Earth, which could lead to the N saturation of terrestrial ecosystems. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) dominated northern hardwood forests in the Upper Great Lakes region may be particularly sensitive to chronic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition, because relatively moderate experimental increases (three times ambient) have resulted in substantial N leaching over a relatively short duration (5-7 years). Although microbial immobilization is an initial sink (i.e., within 1-2 days) for anthropogenic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in this ecosystem, we have an incomplete understanding of the processes controlling the longer-term (i.e., after 1 year) retention and flow of anthropogenic N. Our objectives were to determine: (i) whether chronic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> additions have altered the N content of major ecosystem pools, and (ii) the longer-term fate of <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in plots receiving chronic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> addition. We addressed these objectives using a field experiment in which three northern hardwood plots receive ambient atmospheric N deposition (ca. 0.9 g N m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) and three plots which receive ambient plus experimental N deposition (3.0 g NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>). Chronic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition significantly increased the N concentration and content (g N/m<sup>2</sup>) of canopy leaves, which contained 72% more N than the control treatment. However, chronic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition did not significantly alter the biomass, N concentration or N content of any other ecosystem pool. The largest portion of <sup>15</sup>N recovered after 1 year occurred in overstory leaves and branches (10%). In contrast, we recovered virtually none of the isotope in soil organic matter (SOM), indicating that SOM was not a sink for anthropogenic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> over a 1 year duration. Our results indicate that anthropogenic NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> initially assimilated by the microbial community is released into soil solution where it is subsequently taken up by overstory trees and allocated to the canopy. Anthropogenic N appears to be incorporated into SOM only after it is returned to the forest floor and soil via leaf litter fall. Short- and long-term isotope tracing studies provided very different results and illustrate the need to understand the physiological processes controlling the flow of anthropogenic N in terrestrial ecosystems and the specific time steps over which they operate.
1469639|Published data and analyses from temperate and tropical aquatic systems are used to summarize knowledge about the potential impact of land-use alteration on the nitrogen biogeochemistry of tropical aquatic ecosystems, identify important patterns and recommend key needs for research. The tropical N-cycle is traced from pre-disturbance conditions through the phases of disturbance, highlighting major differences between tropical and temperate systems that might influence development strategies in the tropics. Analyses suggest that tropical freshwaters are more frequently N-limited than temperate zones, while tropical marine systems may show more frequent P limitation. These analyses indicate that disturbances to pristine tropical lands will lead to greatly increased primary production in freshwaters and large changes in tropical freshwater communities. Increased freshwater nutrient flux will also lead to an expansion of the high production, N- and light-limited zones around river deltas, a switch from P- to N-limitation in calcareous marine systems, with large changes in the community composition of fragile mangrove and reef systems. Key information gaps are highlighted, including data on mechanisms of nutrient transport and atmospheric deposition in the tropics, nutrient and material retention capacities of tropical impoundments, and N/P coupling and stoichiometric impacts of nutrient supplies on tropical aquatic communities. The current base of biogeochemical data suggests that alterations in the N-cycle will have greater impacts on tropical aquatic ecosystems than those already observed in the temperate zone.
41490425|Increases in soil freezing associated with decreases in snow cover have been identified as a significant disturbance to nitrogen (N) cycling in northern hardwood forests. We created a range of soil freezing intensity through snow manipulation experiments along an elevation gradient at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in the White Mountains, NH USA in order to improve understanding of the factors regulating freeze effects on nitrate (NO ) leaching, nitrous oxide (NO) flux, potential and in situ net N mineralization and nitrification, microbial biomass carbon (C) and N content and respiration, and denitrification. While the snow manipulation treatment produced deep and persistent soil freezing at all sites, effects on hydrologie and gaseous losses of N were less than expected and less than values observed in previous studies at the HBEF. There was no relationship between frost depth, frost heaving and NO  leaching, and a weak relationship between frost depth and winter NO flux. There was a significant positive relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and NO  concentrations in treatment plots but not in reference plots, suggesting that the snow manipulation treatment mobilized available C, which may have stimulated retention of N and prevented treatment effects on N losses. While the results support the hypothesis that climate change resulting in less snow and more soil freezing will increase N losses from northern hardwood forests, they also suggest that ecosystem response to soil freezing disturbance is affected by multiple factors that must be reconciled in future research.
1469710|Organic matter dissolved in the percolation water of forest soils contributes largely to element cycling and transport of natural and anthropogenic compounds. The way and extent to which these processes are affected depends on the amount and the chemical composition of soluble organic matter. Because the amount of soluble organic matter varies seasonally with changes in the microbial activity in soil, it seems reasonable to assume that there may be also seasonal changes in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter. We examined dissolved organic matter in the seepage waters of organic forest floor layers over a 27-month period (1997-1999) in two forest ecosystems, a 160-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand and a 90-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. The forest floor leachates were analysed for bulk dissolved organic C, C in hydrophilic and hydrophobic dissolved organic matter fractions, lignin-derived phenols (CuO oxidation), hydrolysable neutral carbohydrates and uronic acids, hydrolysable amino sugars, and stable carbon isotope composition. In addition, we studied the samples by use of liquid-state <sup>13</sup>C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For both investigated forest sites we found that the dissolved organic carbon concentrations in forest floor leachates were largest during summer. They peaked after rain storms following short dry periods (106-145 mg dissolved organic Cl<sup>-1</sup>). The proportions of C in the hydrophilic fractions were largest in winter and spring whereas in summer and autumn more C was found in the hydrophobic fraction. According to liquid-state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy, summer and autumn samples had larger abundances of aromatic and aliphatic structures as well as larger proportions of carboxyl groups whereas the winter and spring samples were dominated by resonances indicating carbohydrates. Wet-chemical analyses confirmed these results. Winter and spring samples were rich in neutral carbohydrates and amino sugars. The summer and autumn samples contained more lignin-derived phenols which were also stronger oxidised than those in the winter and spring samples. Seasonal changes of  <sup>13</sup>C values were found to reflect the changes in the chemical composition of dissolved organic matter. Most negative values occurred when isotopically light lignin-derived compounds were abundant and less negative values when carbohydrates predominated. The different vegetation, age of the stands, and underlying mineral soils resulted in different concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and in differences in the distribution between hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic carbon. Despite of this, the results suggest that the trends in temporal variations in the composition of dissolved organic matter in forest floor seepage water were remarkably similar for both sites. Dissolved organic matter in winter and spring seems to be mainly controlled by leaching of fresh disrupted biomass debris with a large contribution of bacterial and fungal-derived carbohydrates and amino sugars. Dissolved organic matter leached from the forest floor in summer and autumn is controlled by the decomposition processes in the forest floor resulting in the production of strongly oxidised, water-soluble aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The chemical composition of dissolved organic matter in forest floor seepage water in winter and spring indicates larger mobility, larger biodegradability, and less interaction with metals and organic pollutants than that released during summer and autumn. Thus, the impact of dissolved organic matter on transport processes may vary throughout the year due to changes in its composition.
24715205|The cultivation of crops in the presence of trees (agroforestry) and organic agriculture are management strategies thought to reduce nutrient losses to the environment and increase soil organic matter. Little is known, however, about the differences between organic and conventionally managed agroforests. This research examines how soil nutrient pools and mechanisms for nutrient retention may vary between these two different types of coffee agroforests. We determined variation in soil nutrient pools and nutrient retention capacity among (1) coffee farms in Costa Rica receiving mineral (conventional management) and organic inputs (organic management) and (2) different combinations of shade tree species. Soil nutrient pools and retention capacity were altered by fertilizer management. Soil nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) pools were significantly larger in conventional agroforests, but C:N ratios were similar among agroforests. Soil phosphorus (P) pools were significantly higher in organic agroforests. Overall, C and N concentrations were strongly positively correlated with oxalate-extractable aluminum concentrations. We did not observe many strong species effects; however, soil cation exchange capacity was higher under CoffeaMusa combinations than under Coffea and N-fixing Erythrina combinations. Thus, mechanisms are in place to promote nutrient retention in agroforestry systems, but these mechanisms can be altered by management practices with consequences for long-term nutrient storage.
1469628| Water samples were collected from the Amazon River system during a high flood period, in June 1989, and lipids associated with particles retained on GF/F filters were examined. Particles showed a highly variable organic carbon content (1.8-29.0%). Corresponding organic carbon concentrations varied from 0.36 to 1.13 mg/l. The flood conditions encountered during the sampling period may feed exceptional inputs of soil organic matter into the tributaries and the Amazon River. Composition and concentration of sterols, fatty acids and pigments were determined to estimate the relative portion of terrigenous and autochthonous fraction of this complex organic matter. Sterol distribution patterns were similar to other equatorial rivers, in the Orinoco (Venezuela) and Solo (Indonesia). In comparison with the dominant profile of the Amazon system, distinct patterns were found in the Trombetas River (29 <sup>5,22</sup> 27 <sup>5</sup> 29 <sup>5</sup> 28 <sup>5</sup>, 28 <sup>5,22</sup>) and in the Tapajos River (<latex>$27\Delta ^{5,22}>27\Delta ^{5}\gg 29\Delta ^{5},\ 28\Delta ^{5},\ 28\Delta ^{5,22}$</latex>). These fingerprints reflect different vegetation types of drainage basins and distinct planktonic pools. The distribution of even-carbon numbered saturated fatty acids in the carbon range of 24-36 revealed low inputs of constituents associated with cuticular waxes of vascular plants in Black waters and in the Tapajos River (200 ng/l), higher in White waters (328-483 ng/l) and highest in the Trombetas River (704 ng/l) and in stagnant waters of a small lake close to the Amazon (1088 ng/l). Pigment concentrations showed that in the main river and most tributaries vegetal carbon did not represent more than 2%, except for the Tapajos River (6.2%) and in relatively stagnant waters sampled along the main river (9.2%). Based on relative abundance of Chl b, Chl c, fucoxanthin, peridinin, alloxanthin, and zeaxanthin, various phytoplanktonic assemblages were evidenced in the Amazon River system. Branched fatty acids in the carbon range of 15-17 gave insight into bacterial signatures. They showed low microbial contribution to the fatty acid pool, with slightest higher contribution in a swamp of stagnant waters and in the White waters of the Solimoes River. 
1469404| We measured soil oxygen concentrations at 10 and 35 cm depths and indices of biogeochemical cycling in upland forest soils along a rainfall and elevation gradient (3500-5000 mm y<sup>-1</sup>; 350-1050 masl) and along topographic gradients (ridge to valley, 150 m) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Along the rainfall gradient, soil O<sub>2</sub> availability decreased significantly with increasing annual rainfall, and reached very low levels (<3%) in individual chambers for up to 25 consecutive weeks over 82 weeks of study. Along localized topographic gradients, soil O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were variable and decreased significantly from ridges to valleys. In the valleys, up to 35% of the observations at 10-35 cm depth were <3% soil O<sub>2</sub>. Cross correlation analyses showed that soil O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were significantly positively correlated along the topographic gradient, and were sensitive to rainfall and hydrologic output. Soil O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in valley soils were correlated with rainfall from the previous day, while ridge sites were correlated with cumulative rainfall inputs over 4 weeks. Soils at the wettest point along the rainfall gradient had very high soil methane concentrations (3-24%) indicating a strong influence of anaerobic processes. We measured net methane emission to the atmosphere at the wettest sites of the rainfall gradient, and in the valleys along topographic gradients. Other measures of biogeochemical function such as soil organic matter content and P availability were sensitive to chronic O<sub>2</sub> depletion along the rainfall gradient, but less sensitive to the variable soil O<sub>2</sub> environment exhibited at lower elevations along topographic gradients. 
20456554|We determined concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in precipitation, throughfall, forest floor and mineral soil leachates from June 2004 to May 2006 across an age-sequence (2-, 15-, 30-, and 65-year-old) of white pine (Pinus strobus L.) forests in southern Ontario, Canada. Mean DOC concentration in precipitation, throughfall, leachates of forest floor, Ah-horizon, and of mineral soil at 1 m depth ranged from 2 to 7, 9 to 18, 32 to 88, 20 to 66, and 2 to 3 mg DOC L, respectively, for all four stands from April (after snowmelt) through December. DOC concentration in forest floor leachates was highest in early summer and positively correlated to stand age, aboveground biomass and forest floor carbon pools. DOC fluxes via precipitation, throughfall, and leaching through forest floor and Ah-horizon between were in the range of 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 0.5 to 3.5, and 0.1 to 2 g DOC m, respectively. DOC export from the forest ecosystem during that period through infiltration and groundwater discharge was estimated as 7, 4, 3, and 2 g DOC m for the 2-, 15-, 30-, and 65-year-old sites, respectively, indicating a decrease with increasing stand age. Laboratory DOC sorption studies showed that the null-point DOC concentration fell from values of 15 to 60 mg DOC L at 0 to 5 cm to &lt;15 mg DOC L at 50 cm. Specific ultraviolet light absorption at 254 nm (SUVA) increased from precipitation and throughfall to a maximum in forest floor and decreased with mineral soil depth. No age-related pattern was observed for SUVA values. DOC concentration in forest floor soil solutions showed a positive exponential relationship with soil temperature, and a negative exponential relationship with soil moisture at all four sites. Understanding the changes and controls of DOC concentrations, chemistry, and fluxes at various stages of forest stand development is necessary to estimate and predict DOC dynamics on a regional landscape level and to evaluate the effect of land-use change.
1468721|Nitrogen immobilization in relation to the dynamics of lignin and tannins in nine different types of leaf litter was investigated during a 2-yr study at two Mediterranean ecosystems of SW Spain. Net nitrogen immobilization for all the species was higher in a forest than in the more nutrient-poor soil of a shrubland. Absolute amount of lignin increased in both ecosystems in the first 2-4 months whereas tannin rapidly decreased in the same time period. Increases in lignin were significantly correlated to losses of tannins during decomposition. Initial tannin content was the best predictor of the maximum amount of immobilized nitrogen in litter in both ecosystems. Mechanisms that could explain the immobilization of nitrogen in litter are discussed.
1469815|The widespread use of volatile chlorinated compounds like chloroform, trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene in industrialized societies causes a large annual release of these compounds into the environment. Due to their role as a source for halogen radicals involved in various catalytic atmospheric reaction cycles, including the regulation of the stratospheric and tropospheric ozone layers, these compounds also constitute a risk for drinking water resources as they can be transported to the groundwater from contaminated field sites or even from atmospheric deposition. Therefore, identification and investigation of sources and sinks of volatile chlorinated compounds are of particular interest. Chloroform, a major contributor to natural gaseous chlorine, was found to be emitted by several anthropogenic and natural sources including the oceans and terrestrial areas. The origin of chloroform in the terrestrial environment can be anthropogenic point sources, atmospheric deposition, release by vegetation and production directly in the soil. The calculated annual biogenic global chloroform emission is 700 Gg, and marine and terrestrial environments are nearly equal contributors. The estimated emissions from anthropogenic sources account for less than 10% of the estimated total emissions from all sources. Among terrestrial sources, forests have recently been identified as contributing to the release of chloroform into the environment. With the data available, annual emissions of chloroform to the atmosphere from forest sites were calculated and compared to other natural sources. At present knowledge, forests are only a minor source in the total biogenic flux of chloroform, contributing less than 1% to the annual global atmospheric input. However, it should be noted that data are available for Northern temperate forests only. The large tropical forest areas may provide a yet unknown input of chloroform.
1469527|Seven Wisconsin rivers with contrasting, relatively homogeneous watershed composition were selected to assess the factors controlling mercury transport. Together, these watersheds allow comparisons of wetland, forest, urban and agricultural land-uses. Each site was sampled nine times between September 1993 and September 1994 to establish seasonal signatures and transport processes of total mercury (Hg<sub>T</sub>) and methylmercury (MeHg). Our results clearly show that land use and land cover strongly influence mercury transport processes. Under base-flow conditions, unfiltered MeHg yield varies by a factor of sixteen (12-195 mg km<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>), and increases with the fraction of wetland area in the watershed. Elevated mercury yields during high flow are particle-phase associated in agricultural sites, but filtered-phase associated in wetland sites. Methylmercury represented less than 5% of total mercury mobilized during the spring thaw across all watersheds. Autumn MeHg yield was generally 11-15% of Hg<sub>T</sub> in wetland influenced watersheds, though a maximum of 51% was observed. In some cases, single high-flow events may dominate the annual export of mercury from a watershed. For example, one high-flow event on the agricultural Rattlesnake Creek had the largest Hg<sub>T</sub> and MeHg yield in the study (107 and 2.32 mg km<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). The mass of mercury transported downstream by this single event was an order of magnitude larger than the eight other (non-event) sampling dates combined. These results underscore the importance of watershed characteristics and seasonal events on the fate of mercury in fresh water rivers.
1469924| The biogeochemistry of nitrogen (N) was evaluated for three forest ecosystems [Woods Lake (WL), Pancake-Hall Creek (PHC) and Huntington Forest (HF)] in the Adirondack region of New York, U.S.A. to evaluate the response of a range of N atmospheric inputs and experimental N additions. Bulk N deposition was higher at sites in the west than those in the central and eastern Adirondacks. These higher atmospheric N inputs were reflected in higher bulk throughfall fluxes of N (WL and PHC, 10.1 and 12.0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) in the western Adirondacks than at HF (4.6 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) in the central Adirondacks. Nitrogen was added to plots as (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 14 and 28 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> or as HNO<sub>3</sub> at 14 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Litter decomposition rates of Fagus grandifolia and Acer rubrum were substantially higher at WL and PHC compared to HF but were not affected by experimental N additions. Results using mineral soil bags showed no effects of N addition on N and C concentrations in soil organic matter, but C and N concentration increases were less at WL and PHC compared to HF. Soil solution nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) concentrations at 15-cm depth in the reference plots were higher at PHC than at WL and HF while at 50-cm concentrations were higher at PHC and WL than at HF. The reference plots at the two sites (WL and PHC) with the highest atmospheric inputs of N exhibited lower N retention (53 and 33%, respectively) than HF (68%) in reference plots. The greatest increase in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> loss in response to the experimental treatments occurred at HF where the HNO<sub>3</sub> additions resulted in the highest NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations and lowest N retentions. In contrast, at WL and PHC increases in soil water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were not evident in response to experimental N additions. The results suggest that the two sites (WL and PHC) in the western Adirondacks did not respond to additional N inputs although they have experienced elevated atmospheric N inputs and higher N drainage losses in reference plots than the HF site in the central Adirondacks. Some of these differences in site response may have also been a function of stand age of WL and PHC that were younger (24 and 33 years, respectively) than the HF (age  70). Highest NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> fluxes in the reference plots across the sites corresponded to higher  <sup>15</sup>N values in soil and plants. An experimental addition experiment at PHC found that the forest floor and the mineral soil were the largest sinks for experimentally added N. 
1469903|Phytoplankton pigments were studied by Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in nine West European estuaries. Three estuaries, i.e. the Rhine, Scheldt and the Gironde were sampled four times to cover the different seasons, whereas the other six estuaries were sampled once. Pigment distributions in estuaries reflect both riverine inputs as well as autochthonous blooms. Fucoxanthin was the most common accessory photosynthetic pigment showing that Diatoms were the most common group in the studied estuaries and were particularly dominant during autumn and winter. In the very turbid Gironde estuary, degradation processes were predominant between salinities 1 and 20, while Diatoms, Dinoflagellates and Cryptophytes bloomed above 20 salinity during spring and summer. This contrasted with the highly eutrophic but less turbid Scheldt, where phytoplanktonic blooms occurred at low salinities close to the city of Antwerp. In the Scheldt, we observed both a tenfold fluctuation of phytoplankton biomass and a fluctuating pigment diversity index. In contrast, chlorophyll a was always low in the Gironde, but we observed large variations of pigment diversity among samplings during different seasons. Distribution of pheopigments showed that the maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) was a highly reactive region for heterotrophic phytoplankton degradation. The Scheldt and the Thames were the most anthropogenic influenced estuaries contrasting with the Gironde estuary that has a less urbanised watershed. An estuarine typology is proposed based on three clusters emerging from a correspondence analysis of pigment variables and variables characterising the anthropogenic impact and physical forcing.
1469293|Fungal filaments are the most abundant organic features in weathered profiles developed on chalky limestone ("platy calcrete"). Their activity affects the mineral dynamics of the pore/carbonate microsystem. A theoretical biogeochemical model is proposed to describe the Ca-oxalate-carbonate cycle related to fungal activity in dry environments. The system studied is the pore itself (defined as the reactor) delimited by its wall and its content: solutions, gases (air and CO<sub>2</sub>), microorganic material, their transformation products and the minerals present (calcite and calcium oxalate). The system exchanges gas and solution with the outside environment, which includes micritic calcite, solutions, a gaseous phase (air and CO<sub>2</sub>), and the nanoporosity of the pore wall constituted by the micritic matrix. A diagram of pH=f(log|Ca<sup>2+</sup>|) is constructed to simulate the behaviour of various fungal excretions, whether the system is open or semi-closed. Two steps are studied. In the first step, the fungi is in full metabolic activity, and assumed to secrete i) an organic diacid (BH<sub>2</sub>) of soluble calcium salt, or ii) oxalic acid, or iii) soluble sodium oxalate, or iv) CO<sub>2</sub>. In the second step, bacteria transform the oxalates into carbonates. In the first step, the model concurs with petrographic observations, on the condition that the system is semi-closed and the aggressive agent produced by the hypha is mostly oxalic acid (COOH)<sub>2</sub>. In the second step, the pore solution becomes saturated in calcite, whether the system is open or semi-closed. This explains the calcium carbonate precipitation inside the pore as needles or microsparite and impregnation of the micritic matrix around the pores. In conclusion, the presence of fungi allows a redistribution of calcium carbonate. This secondary cementation is strong in the case of recrystallization of pore walls and weaker when infilling voids with needles.
1469673| Respiration rates and chemical characteristics of soil organic layers were measured at 40 experimental plots, 5 sampling sites per plot, in a moderately polluted Niepoomice Forest, S. Poland. The respiration rate was positively related to pH, water content and concentrations of Ca and K, and negatively to N<sub>tot</sub>, Zn and Pb (p < 0.001 for all variables). No significant correlation was found between the respiration rate and Na, Cu or Cd (p > 0.25 in all cases). The regression model explained 73% of the total variance. Analysis of variance components revealed that ca. 35% of the total variance in the respiration rate can be explained by the vegetation types covering the area: oak-hornbeam vs. pine-oak forests. The next 40% was explained by the variability between sampling plots and the remaining 25% by within-plot variability among sampling sites. Similar results were obtained for water content. The variance in pH was split 30%:39%:31% between vegetation types:plots:sampling sites. No variance in Ca and Na was explained by the forest type, and approximately half of the variance was due to between-plot and half to within-plot variability. In contrast, potassium concentration differed between forest types (58% variance explained), more than 25% of total variance was due to between-plot variability and only 15% due to within-plot variability. For Zn the results were 1%, 66% and 33%, for Cu 0%, 38% and 62%, for Pb 48%, 18% and 34%, and for Cd 0%, 33% and 67%, respectively. The study clearly shows (1) substantial variance in some soil characteristics between sampling sites and (2) a different split of variance among spatial scales for different soil characteristics. 
24715126|Seasonally stratified areas in temperate shelf seas are usually characterized by a strong spring bloom, followed by limited production within the surface mixed layer as nutrients are depleted in the postbloom period. The bottom mixed layer remains nutrient-rich, due to regeneration processes. When the thermocline is within the euphotic zone, primary production at thermocline depth is possible as organisms can access nutrients from the bottom layer. Ship-based observations indicate that production within these deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) can form a substantial part of the annual production, but this process is not captured by satellite observations. The spatial and temporal behaviour of DCM-related production is therefore less well known. To study the extent of DCM occurrence we applied a fully three dimensional, hydro-biogeochemical model to the North Sea. The simulation was used to quantify sub-surface production in space and time to determine the importance of production within the DCM layer with respect to annual and spring bloom primary production in the North Sea. The results showed that locally, in thermally stratified areas in the North Sea, up to 30% of annual net primary production occurred below 15 m depth. In a 21-year average, sub-surface production contributed 10% to the total annual net primary production in the entire North Sea. These values should be interpreted as lower estimates, as the model was unable to represent observed hot-spots of very high chlorophyll a concentrations at depth. The importance of DCM-related production may increase under future climate scenarios when the length of the stratified period may increase.
1469339|During the initial phases of succession on nutrient-poor, mineral substrates dead plant material accumulates rapidly in the soil. This accumulation of soil organic matter can result in a more than 10-fold increase in nitrogen mineralization within a few decades. These changes in soil features have important consequences for plant growth and the competition between plant species. During succession in heathlands an increase in nutrient mineralization leads to species with low maximum growth rates and low biomass loss rates being replaced by species with high potential growth rates and high biomass losses. The plant properties responsible for reduced biomass loss rates appear to result in the litter produced being poorly decomposable, whereas the litter from plants with high potential growth rates decomposes more easily. Model simulations suggest that such combinations of plant features greatly influence the increase in mineralization and the change in plant species composition during ecosystem development. Studies in the field and garden plot experiments confirmed this hypothesis.
1468978|As reported from marine systems, we found that also in 15 prealpine lakes N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations were strongly correlated with O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In oxic waters below the mixed surface layer, N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations usually increased with decreasing O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. N<sub>2</sub>O is produced in oxic epilimnia, in oxic hypolimnia and at oxic-anoxic boundaries, either in the water or at the sediment-water interface. It is consumed, however, in completely anoxic layers. Anoxic water layers were therefore N<sub>2</sub>O undersaturated. All studied lakes were sources for atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O, including those with anoxic, N<sub>2</sub>O undersaturated hypolimnia. However, compared to agriculture, lakes seem not to contribute significantly to atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.
1469675| Seasonal variations in anaerobic respiration pathways were investigated at three saltmarsh sites using chemical data, sulfate reduction rate measurements, enumerations of culturable populations of anaerobic iron-reducing bacteria (FeRB), and quantification of in situ 16S rRNA hybridization signals targeted for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Bacterial sulfate reduction in the sediments followed seasonal changes in temperature and primary production of the saltmarsh, with activity levels lowest in winter and highest in summer. In contrast, a dramatic decrease in the FeRB population size was observed during summer at all sites. The collapse of FeRB populations during summer was ascribed to high rates of sulfide production by SRB, resulting in abiotic reduction of bioavailable Fe(III) (hydr)oxides. To test this hypothesis, sediment slurry incubations at 10, 20 and 30 C were carried out. Increases in temperature and labile organic carbon availability (acetate or lactate additions) increased rates of sulfate reduction while decreasing the abundance of culturable anaerobic FeRB. These trends were not reversed by the addition of amorphous Fe(III) (hydr)oxides to the slurries. However, when sulfate reduction was inhibited by molybdate, no decline in FeRB growth was observed with increasing temperature. Addition of dissolved sulfide adversely impacted propagation of FeRB whether molybdate was added or not. Both field and laboratory data therefore support a sulfide-mediated limitation of microbial iron respiration by SRB. When total sediment respiration rates reach their highest levels during summer, SRB force a decline in the FeRB populations. As sulfate reduction activity slows down after the summer, the FeRB are able to recover. 
1469260|The Experimental Watershed Liming Study (EWLS) was initiated to evaluate the application of CaCO<sub>3</sub> to a forested watershed in an effort to mitigate the acidification of surface water. The objective of the EWLS was to assess the response of the Woods Lake watershed to an experimental addition of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. During October 1989, 6.89 Mg CaCO<sub>3</sub>/ha was applied by helicopter to two subcatchments comprising about 50% (102.5 ha) of the watershed area. The EWLS involved individual investigations of the response of soil and soil water chemistry, forest and wetland vegetation, soil microbial processes, wetland, stream and lake chemistry, and phytoplankton and fish to the CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment. In addition, the Integrated Lake/Watershed Acidification (ILWAS) model was applied to the site to evaluate model performance and duration of the treatment. The results of these studies are detailed in this volume. The purposes of this introduction and synthesis paper are to: 1) present the overall design of the EWLS, 2) discuss the linkages between the individual studies that comprise the EWLS, and 3) summarize the response of the lakewater chemistry to watershed addition of CaCO<sub>3</sub> and compare these results to previous studies of direct lake addition. An analysis of lake chemistry revealed the watershed treatment resulted in a gradual change in pH, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the water column. This pattern was in contrast to direct lake additions of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, which were characterized by abrupt changes following base addition and subsequent rapid reacidification. Over the three-year study period, the supply of ANC to drainage waters was largely derived from dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in wetlands. Relatively little dissolution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> occurred in freely draining upland soils. The watershed treatment had only minor effects on forest vegetation. The watershed treatment eliminated the episodic acidification of streamwater and the near-shore region of the lake during snowmelt, a phenomenon that occurred during direct lake treatments. Positive ANC water in the near-shore area may improve chemical conditions for fish reproduction, and allow for the development of a viable fish population. The watershed CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment also decreased the transport of Al from the watershed to the lake, and increased the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved silica (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) in stream and lakewater. The watershed treatment appeared to enhance soil nitrification, increasing concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in soilwater and surface waters. However, the acidity associated with this NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> release was small compared to the increase in ANC due to CaCO<sub>3</sub> addition and did not alter the acid-base status of Woods Lake. Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) budgets for 12-month periods before and after the watershed treatment showed that the lake shifted from a large source of ANC to a minor source due to retention of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Al and the elevated inputs of Ca<sup>2+</sup> associated with the watershed CaCO<sub>3</sub> application. In contrast to the direct lake treatments, Ca<sup>2+</sup> inputs from the watershed application were largely transported from the lake.
24716782|Long-term trends in ion concentrations of bulk precipitation, throughfall, forest floor leachate (humus water) and shallow and deep soil water were assessed at two Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) standsone on an Atlantic peat bog in the west of Ireland (Cloosh), the other on the east coast on a peaty podzol (Roundwood). Deposition at Cloosh was dominated by marine ions (sodium, [Na], chloride [Cl], and magnesium [Mg]), whereas bulk precipitation and throughfall at Roundwood was characterized by inputs of non-marine sulphate (nmSO), acidity and inorganic nitrogen (NH, NO). Significant declines in concentrations of nmSO and acidity in bulk precipitation and throughfall were observed at both sites. The decline in throughfall nmSO was significantly related to reductions in European sulphur dioxide (SO) emissions. At Roundwood, SO declined significantly in humus, shallow and deep soil water. In deep soil water this was accompanied by a long-term increase in pH and a reduction in total aluminum (Altot). The recovery from acidification was delayed by high concentrations of NO, which strongly influenced acidity and Altot concentrations. At Cloosh, there was a significant decline in SO in humus water but longterm trends were not evident in shallow or deep soil water; SO concentrations at these depths fluctuated in response to drought-events. Marine ions strongly influenced soil water chemistry at both sites; at Cloosh soil water acidity was strongly related to Na and Cl, while at Roundwood, Na, Cl and Mg influenced Altot concentrations. Dissolved organic carbon increased significantly in humus and soil water at Roundwood, where it was associated with declining acidity. Soil water at both sites was influenced by a combination of anthropogenic sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition, drought and sea-salt events. The study highlights the value of long-term monitoring in assessing the response of forest soils to S and N deposition against a background of climate influences on soil water through drought and sea-salt events.
24715127|Results from extensive cruises in the years 2000 and 2001 throughout distinct ecohydrodynamic regions of the central and southern North Sea are presented and used to generate estimates of gross primary production and new production. An undulating CTD fitted with a fluorometer was towed over a distance of 12,000 kms. Fluorescence data were used to determine the chlorophyll distribution and derive estimates of phytoplankton biomass. These results were combined with estimates of primary production (new and regenerated) from experiments from one cruise in order to estimate gross production for a greater geographical extent. Results from repeat inter-annual transects showed that the strength of the thermocline and the associated deep chlorophyll maximum were variable. However, when the primary production was integrated over the 1540 m depth, the variability between years was low. While the depth and strength of the deep chlorophyll maximum varied across the region, a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) is a consistent and widespread feature of this region at around 30 m depth. In 2001 the calculated average primary production rate in summer for the whole area surveyed was 0.91 g C m day. This daily production equates to 130 g C m for the summer stratified period. In the offshore stratified regions around the Dogger Bank and Eastern Central North Sea primary production of 64 g C m associated with the deep chlorophyll maximum (1540 m) accounted for 60 % of total primary production during the summer stratified period (after the spring bloom). Approximately 66 % of new production in these areas occurred in the DCM. This study shows the extent of the DCM in the North Sea and demonstrates its importance in sustaining primary production after the spring bloom.
1468562|To demonstrate the contribution of atmospheric ammonium to soil acidification in acid forest soils, a field study with <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium as tracer was performed in an oak-birch forest soil. Monitoring and analysis of soil solutions from various depths on the <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium and <sup>15</sup>N-nitrate contents, showed that about 54% of the applied <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium was oxidized to nitrate in the forest floor. Over a period of one year about 20% of the <sup>15</sup>N remained as organic nitrogen in this layer. The percentage <sup>15</sup>N enrichment in ammonium and nitrate were in the same range in all the forest floor percolates, indicating that even in extremely acid forest soils (pH < 4) nitrate formation from ammonium can occur. Clearly, atmospheric ammonium can contribute to soil acidification even at low soil pH.
1469456|<sup>13</sup>C labelled plant material was incubated in situ over 2 to 3 years in 8 conifer forest soils located on acid and limestone parent material along a north-south climatic transect from boreal to dry Mediterranean regions in western Europe. The objectives of the experiment were to evaluate the effects of climate and the soil environment on decomposition and soil organic matter dynamics. Changes in climate were simulated using a north-to-south cascade procedure involving the relocation of labelled soil columns to the next warmer site along the transect. Double exponential, decay-rate functions (for labile and recalcitrant SOM compartments) vs time showed that the thermosensitivity of microbial processes depended on the latitude from which the soil was translocated. Cumulative response functions for air temperature, and for combined temperature and moisture were used as independent variables in first order kinetic models fitted to the decomposition data. In the situations where climatic response functions explained most of the variations in decomposition rates when the soils were translocated, the climate optimised decomposition rates for the local and the translocated soil should be similar. Differences between these two rates indicated that there was either no single climatic response function for one or both compartments, and/or other edaphic factors influenced the translocation effect. The most northern boreal soil showed a high thermosensitivity for recalcitrant organic matter compartment, whereas the labile fraction was less sensitive to climate changes for soils from more southern locations. Hence there was no single climatic function which describe the decay rates for all compartments. At the end of the incubation period it was found that the heat sum to achieve the same carbon losses was lower for soils in the north of the transect than in the south. In the long term, therefore, for a given heat input, decomposition rates would show larger increases in boreal northern sites than in warm temperate regions. The changes in climate produced by soil translocation were more clearly reflected by decomposition rates in the acid soils than for calcareous soils. This indicates that the physicochemical environment can have important differential effects on microbial decomposition of the labile and recalcitrant components of SOM.
1469825|Cyanobacterial periphyton communities are a dominant feature of oligotrophic Everglades marshes, however, little is known regarding the biogeochemical aspects of this ecosystem component. This study was undertaken to investigate the potential for N<sub>2</sub> fixation in the periphyton communities of a hydrologically-controlled portion of the northern Everglades marsh (Water Conservation Area 2A, WCA-2A). The objectives of this research were to characterize the temporal patterns of nutrient composition and N<sub>2</sub> fixation of the natural WCA-2A periphyton communities and to compare fixation rates of periphyton with those of other ecosystem components in both natural and nutrient-impacted WCA-2A areas. In general, N<sub>2</sub> fixation (measured by the acetylene reduction (AR) method) of natural WCA-2A periphyton was enhanced under light conditions showing a nitrogenase pattern characteristic of autotrophic cyanobacteria. Winter (November-March) rates of AR expressed per gram organic carbon (gOC) ranged from 147-240 nmol C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> g OC<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, while summer rates were elevated with an observed peak of 1148 nmol C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> g OC<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> in July 1998. This translates into an estimated yearly contribution of approximately 10 g N m<sup>-2</sup> to an unimpacted WCA-2A slough ecosystem. Nitrogenase activity did not correlate seasonally with nutrients (Ca, Mg, Fe, N, P, Mn), but closely followed measured N stable isotopic ratios ( <sup>15</sup>N) in floating periphyton. In oligotrophic marsh areas, AR (on a weight basis) decreased in the order floating periphyton > benthic periphyton floc > soil > water > detrital plant biomass, while highest AR rates were observed for detrital biomass in areas impacted by agricultural discharges.
24715129|The trophodynamics of pelagic and benthic animals of the North Sea, North Atlantic shelf, were assessed using stable isotope analysis (SIA) of natural abundance carbon and nitrogen isotopes, lipid fingerprinting and compound-specific SIA (CSIA) of phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs). Zooplankton (z), epi- and supra-benthic macrofauna were collected in the Southern Bight, at the Oyster Grounds and at North Dogger, 111 km north of the Dogger Bank. The study included 22 taxonomic groups with particular reference to Mollusca (Bivalvia and Gastropoda) and Crustacea. Primary consumers (Bivalvia) were overall most N enriched in the southern North Sea (6.1) and more depleted in the Oyster Grounds (5.5) and at North Dogger (2.8) demonstrating differences in isotopic baselines for bivalve fauna between the study sites. Higher trophic levels also followed this trend. Over an annual cycle, consumers tended to exhibit N depletion during spring followed by N enriched signatures in autumn and winter. The observed seasonal changes of N were more pronounced for suspension feeders and deposit feeders (dfs) than for filter feeders (ffs). The position of animals in plots of C and N largely concurred with the expected position according to literature-based functional feeding groups. PLFA fingerprints of groups such as z were distinct from benthic groups, e.g. benthic ffs and dfs, and predatory macrobenthos. CPLFA signatures indicated similarities in C moiety sources that constituted CPLFA. Although functional groups of pelagic zooplankton and (supra-) benthic animals represented phylogenetically distinct consumer groups, CPLFA demonstrated that both groups were supported by pelagic primary production and relied on the same macronutrients such as PLFAs. Errors related to the static categorization of small invertebrates into fixed trophic positions defined by phylogenetic groupings rather than by functional feeding groups, and information on seasonal trophodynamic variability, may have implications for the reliability of numerical marine ecosystem models.
1469860| Data from 13 catchments with no arable land in Northern Scotland were used to develop empirical linear regression models of average monthly NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations and average summer and winter concentrations for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a function of catchment characteristics. All catchments displayed a pronounced seasonal NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cycle. Variation in monthly mean NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration within and between catchments could be predicted from mean monthly air temperature using separate regression equations for temperatures < and  5 C. Soil type, climate and land use influenced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations. In summer, concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were largest in catchments with extensive areas of brown forest soils, which are less acidic and more base-rich than other upland soils. However, concentrations declined with increasing conifer cover and summer rainfall. In winter, however, % conifer cover had a positive effect, while higher temperature and higher humus iron podzol cover had negative influences. DON concentration decreased with increasing catchment elevation in both summer and winter. Surprisingly, concentrations of DON only displayed a positive relationship with percentage peat cover in the summer. The most important factor controlling DOC concentration was soil type, with a positive relationship being observed between DOC and peat and humus iron podzol coverage. Elevation was also important, but only in the winter when concentrations were negatively correlated with maximum catchment elevation. Overall, multivariate regression equations explained the spatial and seasonal variability in N species concentrations over a range of catchments within Northern Scotland. 
1468789|We studied the factors causing spatial and temporal patterning of interstitial water chemistry in Crystal Bog, a 7 ha northern Wisconsin kettle-hole peatland. Over the course of the snow-free season Crystal Bog exhibited spatial and temporal patterns in chemistry, especially hydrogen-ion, dissolved organic carbon, and specific conductance. The peatland contains a 0.5 ha pond that has water more dilute than the interstitial water of the surrounding peatland. The direction of groundwater flow between the lake and the peatland was seasonally dependent. In the spring and early summer, flow was from the lake into the peatland, especially on the eastern side of the lake. This flow resulted in a plume of relatively dilute surface interstitial water in the peatland. In mid and late summer direction of groundwater flow was from the peatland into the lake and the dilute plume was reduced in areal extent. By fall the direction of water flow was again from the lake to the peatland. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity in water chemistry produced by the seasonal variation in the direction of horizontal water flow was substantial. Minimum and maximum observed concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the interstitial water of the peatland, for example, differed by more than a factor of three, and pH ranged between 3.8 and 5.0. Correlations of DOC with anion deficit and hydrogen ion concentration and experiments of photo-oxidation of water samples showed that organic acids were the primary cause of acidity in the peatland. Specific conductance was highly correlated with DOC, probably because of DOC's correlation with the very conductive hydrogen ion. In Crystal Bog it was possible to use the relatively simple measure of specific conductance to estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of the more difficult to determine DOC.
24715185|Riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) supports the production of estuaries and coastal ecosystems, constituting one of the most actively recycled pools of the global carbon cycle. A substantial proportion of DOC entering oceans is highly aged, but its origins remain unclear. Significant fluxes of old DOC have never been observed in temperate headwaters where terrestrial imports take place. Here, we studied the radiocarbon age of DOC in three streams draining forested headwater catchments of the river Mulde (Ore Mountains, Germany). In a 4 week summer precipitation event DOC aged at between 160 and 270 years was delivered into the watershed. In one stream, the DOC was modern but depleted in radiocarbon compared to other hydrological conditions. The yield was substantial and corresponded to 2052 % of the annual DOC yields in wet and dry years, respectively. The analysis of long-term data suggested that the DOC export in extreme precipitation events added to the annual yield and was not compensated for by lower exports in remaining periods. We conclude that climate change, along with additional processes associated with human activities, channels old soil carbon into more rapidly cycled carbon pools of the hydrosphere.
1468950| The biogeochemistry of Ca, Mg, K, and Na were investigated in two forested catchments in the Czech Republic, one underlain by leucogranite, the other by serpentinite. High weathering rates at the serpentinite site at Pluhv Bor resulted in Mg<sup>2+</sup> as the dominant cation on the soil exchange complex and in drainage water. Other basic cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>,Na<sup>+</sup>) showed relatively low concentrations and outflow in streamwater. The catchment exhibited high base saturation in mineral soils (>70%), and near neutral soil and stream pH, despite elevated inputs of acidic deposition. Slow growth of Norway spruce at Pluhv Bor may be caused by K deficiency, Mg oversupply and/or Ni toxicity. In contrast, the granitic site at Lysina showed low concentrations of basic cations on the soil exchange complex and in streamwater. Soil and drainage water at Lysina were highly impacted by acidic deposition. Soil pH was extremely acidic (<4.5) throughout the soil profile, and the base saturation of the mineral soil was very low (<5%). Supplies of basic cations from atmospheric deposition and soil processes were less than inputs of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> on an equivalence basis, resulting in low pH and high concentrations of total Al in drainage water. Needle yellowing in Norway spruce was possibly the result of Mg deficiency at Lysina. Because of their extremely different lithologies, these catchments serve as valuable end-members of ecosystem sensitivity to elevated levels of acidic deposition.

We studied the effects of wind erosion on the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and other soil nutrients at the Jornada Experimental Range, in southern New Mexico. Enhanced wind erosion was encouraged by grass cover reduction in a Sporobolus-mcsquite dominated site (SM) and a Bouteloua-mesquite dominated site (BM). The scale and magnitude of spatial dependence for the soil analytes were quantified using geostatistical analyses.

1469726|In order to investigate the effects of anticipated increased precipitation and changing soil nutrient levels on soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from high arctic semi desert, a field experiment was carried out in Northeast Greenland. Water, phosphorus, and nitrogen were added to plots in a fully factorial design. Soil microbial biomass carbon was analysed after one year, and respiration from soil plus roots was measured in situ throughout the third growing season after initiation of the experiment. Soil plus root respiration was enhanced by up to 47%, and the microbial biomass by 24%, by the weekly water additions, but not by nutrient additions. The direct effect of increased soil moisture on CO<sub>2</sub> efflux suggests that future changes of precipitation levels and patterns may strongly affect below-ground respiration in arctic semi deserts, with direction of responses depending upon amounts and frequencies of precipitation events. Morover, low CO<sub>2</sub> emission at low light intensities regardless of treatment suggests that the major part of the below-ground respiration originated from turnover of recently fixed C. Hence, the more recalcitrant soil organic matter C pool may not change in proportion to changes in below-ground respiration rate.

40343571|Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) has been frequently ignored as a nutrient source to marine ecosystems because it is difficult to identify and quantify. However, recent studies show its ubiquity and ecological importance to the coastal zone, particularly when associated with contaminated continental aquifers. The Ria Formosa is a coastal lagoon located in the south of Portugal and surrounded by an intensely farmed area. Following a 12-month field study using seepage meters, we identified groundwater discharge in the intertidal zone of the lagoon. The seeping fluid was a mixture of two water types: one with low salinity and high nitrate concentration and another similar to local seawater. Based on the integration of monthly seepage rate measurements throughout the year, we estimate the mean discharge of submarine groundwater into the lagoon to be 3.6 m day per linear meter of coastline with freshwater contributions (per volume) ranging from 10% to 50%. The results of this study suggest a continental origin for the freshwater component, thus linking the biogeochemical cycles in the lagoon to anthropogenic activities taking place in the neighboring coastal plain. We further identify SGD as an important nutrient source to the Ria Formosa, estimating annual loads of 36.2 mol (0.507 kg) of Nitrogen, 1.1 mol (0.034 kg) of Phosphorus and 18.6 mol (0.522 kg) of Silicon per meter of coastline. Based on these results, we suggest that SGD is a potential contributor to the observed nutrification status of the Ria Formosa lagoon.
40343619|Variation in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of surface waters is a consequence of process changes in the surrounding terrestrial environment, both within annual cycles and over the longer term. Long-term records (1987-2006) of DOC concentrations at six catchments (0.44-10.0 km) across a climatic transect in Scotland were investigated for intra-annual relationships to evaluate potential long-term seasonal patterns. The intra-annual mode of DOC export contrasted markedly between catchments and appeared dependent on their hydrological characteristics. Catchments in wetter Central Scotland with high rainfall-runoff ratios, short transit times and well-connected responsive soils show a distinct annual periodicity in DOC concentrations throughout the long-term datasets. Increased DOC concentrations occurred between June and November with correspondingly lower DOC concentrations from December to May. This appears unrelated to discharge, and is dependent mainly on higher temperatures driving biological activity, increasing decomposition of available organic matter and solubility of DOC. The drier eastern catchments have lower rainfall-runoff ratios, longer transit times and annual drying-wetting regimes linked to changing connectivity of soils. These are characterised by seasonal DOC concentration-discharge relationships with an autumnal flush of DOC. Temperature influences the availability of organic matter for DOC transport producing a high DOC concentration-discharge relationship in summer/autumn and low DOC concentration-discharge relationship in winter/spring. These two distinct modes of seasonal DOC transport have important implications for understanding changes in DOC concentrations and export brought about by climate change (temperature and precipitation) and modelling of aquatic carbon losses from soil-types under different hydrological regimes.
1469844|Sulphur dioxide in air as well as dry deposition of sulphur dioxide to a forest has decreased by a factor of 20 during the last two decades. It was earlier found that the internal circulation of calcium in Norway spruce follows the dry deposition of sulphur dioxide. The sulphur and calcium fluxes from 1992 were calculated from wet deposition, throughfall and a surrogate surface. Earlier fluxes from 1981 to 1991 were calculated using assumptions of the dry deposition of non-marine sulphate and calcium. The new estimates confirm the earlier studies that the internal circulation of calcium in a coniferous forest is directly related to the dry deposition of sulphur dioxide to the canopies and that the internal circulation of calcium decreases at the same rate as the deposition of sulphur decreased during the last two decades. The deposition fluxes were also compared to run-off and uptake of calcium in the forest as well as on modelled weathering rates from severely acidified forested catchments near the coast and inland and the soil pool. A reconstruction of changes in the soil pool of calcium over the last 100 years indicate that the soil pool has decreased by ca. 70% in catchments with complete harvest of the forest and ca. 40% of branches and needles are left on the ground. In a natural forest without acid deposition the soil pool of calcium would have increased by 6%. Estimates for the 21st century show that harvesting of stems + branches and needles may almost empty the soil pool of calcium in the next 100 years. Increased nitrogen deposition has increased forest growth, which indirectly increased uptake of calcium by the trees and indirectly caused a further decrease of the soil pool of calcium.
20456459|During an annual cycle, overlying water and sediment cores were collected simultaneously at three sites (Tavira, Culatra and Ramalhete) of Ria Formosa's intertidal muddy and subtidal sandy sediments to determine ammonium, nitrates plus nitrites and phosphate. Organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus were also determined in superficial sediments. Ammonium and phosphate dissolved in porewater were positively correlated with temperature (P &lt; 0.01) in muddy and sandy sediments, while the nitrogen-oxidized forms had a negative correlation (P &lt; 0.02) in muddy sediments probably because mineralization and nitrification/denitrification processes vary seasonally. Porewater ammonium profiles evidenced a peak in the top-most muddy sediment (380 M) suggesting higher mineralization rate when oxygen is more available, while maximum phosphate concentration (113 M) occurred in the sub-oxic layer probably due to phosphorus desorption under reduced conditions. In organically poor subtidal sandy sediments, nutrient porewater concentrations were always lower than in intertidal muddy sediments, ranging annually from 20 M to 100 M for ammonium and from 0.05 M to 16 M for phosphate. Nutrient diffusive fluxes predicted by a mathematical model were higher during summer, in both muddy (104 nmol cm d--<tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math>; 8 nmol cm d--<tex-math>$\text{HPO}_{4}^{-2}$</tex-math>) and sandy sediments (26 nmol cm d--<tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math>; 1 nmol cm d--<tex-math>$\text{HPO}_{4}^{-2}$</tex-math>), while during lower temperature periods these fluxes were 3-4 times lower. Based on simulated nutrient effluxes, the estimated annual amount of ammonium and phosphate exported from intertidal areas was three times higher than that released from subtidal areas (22 ton year--<tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math>; 2 ton year--<tex-math>$\text{HPO}_{4}^{-2}$</tex-math>), emphasizing the importance of tidal flats to maintain the high productivity of the lagoon. Global warming scenarios simulated with the model, revealed that an increase in lagoon water temperature only produces significant variations (P &lt; 0.05) for <tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math> in porewater and consequent diffusive fluxes, what will probably affect the system productivity due to a N/P ratio unbalance.
1469959|Changes in concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reflect biogeochemical processes that determine chemical composition of groundwater and other natural waters. We found that the deeper the vadose zone, the lower the concentration of DOC in groundwater near the water table, indicating that considerable attenuation of surface-derived DOC occurred in the vadose zone. Under vadose zones <1.25 m, DOC concentrations at the surface of the water table ranged to <latex>$>20\ \text{mg C l}^{-1}$</latex>, while for vadose zones >5.0 m, DOC never exceeded 2.0 mg C l<sup>-1</sup>. DOC concentrations also decreased exponentially with increasing depth below the water table, most notably in the upper two meters, implying continued attenuation in the upper layer of the saturated zone. Ninety-nine percent of the DOC was attenuated by the time the water reached a depth of 19 m below the water table. A strong inverse relationship between DOC and nitrate concentrations suggests that nitrate is depleted where DOC supplies are high, providing evidence that some portion of the DOC losses in groundwater are due to microbial transformations, including denitrification. DOC concentrations in shallow groundwater show considerable spatial variability, but concentration of DOC at any one site is surprisingly stable over time. The largest source of variation in DOC concentration in groundwater therefore is spatial rather than temporal, suggesting that local heterogeneities play an important role in DOC delivery to shallow groundwater. Our results highlight both the importance of shallow vadose areas in DOC delivery to groundwater and the need to distinguish where samples are collected in relation to flow paths before conclusions are made about mean groundwater DOC concentrations. The substantial losses of DOC in the vadose zone and in shallow depths within the aquifer suggest quite active biogeochemical processes in these boundary environments.
40980874|The practice of harvesting forest residues is rapidly increasing due to rising demand for renewable energy. However, major concerns have been raised about the sustainability of this practice and its net impact on long term soil ability to support forest productivity, particularly through second and subsequent rotations. In this study, soil chemical properties such as acidity, total N and C, available NO-N and NH-N and exchangeable cations were measured in all horizons in peaty gleys soils under one of the oldest experiments in Europe a 28-year-old second rotation stand of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), in Kielder forest, UK. Treatments included Whole Tree Harvesting (WTH of all above ground biomass), Conventional stem-only harvesting (CH) of the first rotation crop, and repeated Fertilisation (FE) after the planting of the second rotation forest. This study demonstrates the soil changes underpinning the reduced second rotation tree productivity on these acidic upland sites under WTH, a further 18 years after the investigation by Proe and Dutch (1994). Overall, WTH increased soil acidity significantly (p < 0.05) and reduced soil base saturation whilst FE reduced soil acidity (p < 0.05) and increased soil base saturation as compared to CH. Soil moisture was significantly higher (p < 0.01) under WTH compared to CH and FE plots. There was no evidence that WTH decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (N), but to the contrary there were significantly (p < 0.01) higher concentrations and stocks of total The depletion of SOC and N in CH and FE plots was attributed to much higher soil mineralisation rates associated with the brash and fertilisation as compared to the WTH plots, where significantly less soil available NO-N (p < 0.01) was found. In the long term WTH on peaty gley soils appears positive for soil and N storage. However, WTH had a long term negative impact on soil and tree nutrition of K and P, which are currently at deficient levels, but has had a stabilising effect on tree N nutrition as measured in twigs and needles. These results suggest that whilst WTH lead to a reduction in aboveground tree biomass compared to conventional harvest, these practices on selected soil types and certain sites may be beneficial for soil and N sequestration. The overall findings of this study imply that cost benefit analyses for each site should be carried out before decisions are made on the appropriate type of forest operations (harvesting and replanting), considering both geology and soils in order to serve both environmental benefits, long term sustainability and the available biomass production for timber and biofuel.
1468920|More detailed knowledge of the density of organic carbon in soils of boreal forests is needed for accurate estimates of the size of this C stock. We investigated the effect of vegetation type and associated site fertility on the C density at 30 mature coniferous forest sites in southern Finland and evaluated the importance of deep layers to the total C store in the soil by extending the sampling at eight of the sites to the depth of ground water level (2.4-4.6 m). The C density in the organic horizon plus 1 m thick mineral soil layer ranged from 4.0 kg m<sup>2</sup> to 11.9 kg m<sup>2</sup>, and, on the average, increased towards the more productive vegetation types. Between the depth of 1 m and the ground water level the C density averaged 1.3-2.4 kg m<sup>2</sup> at the studied vegetation types and these layers represented 18-28% of the total stock of C in the soil. The results emphasize the importance of also considering these deep layers to correctly estimate the total amount of C in these soils. At the least fertile sites the soil contained about 30% more C than phytomass, whereas at the more fertile sites the amount of C in soil was about 10% less than the amount bound in vegetation.
20456557|This study uses the extensive monitoring datasets of the Environment Agency of England and Wales to calculate the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC); particulate organic carbon (POC); and excess dissolved CO through English and Welsh rivers. The innovation of this study's approach is to account for the losses of carbon within the fluvial system as well as fluxes at the catchment outlet. In order to make this assessment this study considers: the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) as a measure of the degradation of DOC; and the dissolved CO concentration of groundwater as calculated and apportioned into surface waters on the basis of Ca concentrations. The study shows that the best estimate of carbon export, via rivers, from England and Wales is 10.34 Mg C/km/year, with 4.19 Mg C/km/year of this going to the atmosphere. The mapping of the carbon export shows that there are regional hotspots of carbon export and in a small number of cases rivers could be net sinks of carbon due to their low dissolved CO content relative to the atmosphere. The flux calculated by this approach is probably still an underestimate of the carbon flux through fluvial systems but the scale of the export is greater than that previously reported and there is evidence that the fluvial flux of carbon is increasing on a decadal scale.
24715155|Migratory animals can alter ecosystem function via the provision of nutrient subsidies. These subsidies are heterogeneous in space and time, which may create hot spots or hot moments in biogeochemical transformations, in turn altering the ecosystem effect of the subsidy by changing the form of the nutrients. Annual migrations of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) transport nutrients from the marine environment to their natal freshwater ecosystems. Salmon subsidies provide high quality nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon) that may also be large in quantity where salmon migrations are near historic levels. We hypothesized that the nutrient subsidy provided via the excretion of ammonium (NH) by live salmon would stimulate microbially mediated nitrification rates in stream sediments and increase streamwater nitrate (NO) concentrations. We quantified sediment nitrification in seven streams in Southeast Alaska before and during the salmon run in 2007 and 2008. Nitrification rates increased 3-fold from before to during the salmon run (mean  SE = 0.07  0.01 to 0.24  0.02 mgN gAFDM d, respectively). The variation in nitrification was explained by both streamwater and exchangeable NH concentrations (R = 0.50 and 0.71, respectively), which were low before salmon and increased relative to the size of the salmon run. To experimentally test the effect of salmon subsidies on nitrification rates, we staked senesced salmon carcasses on stream sediments for 3 weeks during the salmon run and then measured nitrification rates directly under the carcasses. Sediment nitrification was 25 times higher under the carcasses compared to nearby sediments without the direct carcass influence. Our results confirm that biogeochemical transformations alter the form of salmon-derived nitrogen, representing an overlooked aspect in the dynamics of this subsidy. Therefore, animal-derived nutrient subsidies are not passively retained or exported in recipient ecosystems, but also transformed, thereby influencing the form and incorporation of these nutrient subsidies.
1469854|Denitrification is a major mechanism for nitrogen removal from nitrogen-rich waters, but it requires oxygen-poor conditions. We assessed denitrification rates in nitrate-rich but also oxygen-rich river water during its stay in a floodplain. We measured diurnal oxygen fluctuations in floodwater along the river Rhine, and carried out an experiment to assess denitrification rates during day, evening and night. Denitrification in floodwater and flooded sediment were measured, comparing activity of periphyton and sediment from agricultural grasslands and reedbeds. Floodwater along the river Rhine was oxygen-saturated (> 10 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L) during the day, but oxygen largely disappeared during the night (0.4-0.8 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L. Independent of oxygen concentrations, denitrification in surface water alone hardly occurred. In flooded sediments, however, denitrification rates were much higher (1.1-1.5 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>), particularly at dark and oxygen-poor conditions (nighttime). In the experimental jars, reedbed-periphyton bacteria achieved similar denitrification rates as bacteria in sediment, but overall periphyton denitrification was of minor importance when calculated per square meter. Apart from oxygen levels, maximum denitrification appeared to be regulated by nitrate diffusion from water into the sediment, as the maximum quantity of N denitrified in the sediment equalled the quantity of N lossed from the surface water. Assessed 24-hr denitrification rates in the flooded floodplains (c. 15 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) were similar in grasslands and reedbeds, and were rather low compared to rates in other floodplains.
20519847|There is a variety of methodologies used in the aquatic sciences and soil sciences for extracting different forms of Si from sediments and soils. However, a comparison of the published extraction techniques is lacking. Here we review the methodologies used to extract different Si fractions from soils and sediments. Methods were classified in those to assess plant-available Si and those to extract Si from amorphous silica and allophane. Plant-available Si is supposed to comprise silicic acid in soil solution and adsorbed to soil particles. Extraction techniques for plant-available Si include extractions with water, CaCl, acetate, acetic acid, phosphate, HSO, HSO, and citrate. The extractants show different capabilites to desorb silicic acid, with HSO, HSO and citrate having the greater extraction potential. The most common extractants to dissolve amorphous silica from soils and aquatic sediments are NaOH and NaCO, but both also dissolve crystalline silicates to varying degrees. In soils moreover Tiron is used to dissolve amorphous silica, while oxalate is used to dissolve allophanes and imogolite-type materials. Most techniques analyzing for biogenic silica in aquatic environments use a correction method to identify mineral derived Si. By contrast, in the soil sciences no correction methods are used although pedologists are well aware of the overestimation of amorphous silica by the NaOH extraction, which is most commonly used to extract silica from soils. It is recommended that soil scientists begin to use the techniques developed in the aquatic sciences, since it seems impossible to extract amorphous Si from soils completely without dissolving some of the crystalline silicates.
1468628| Element interactions within forests differ from those in other major ecosystems for three major reasons: - a greater allocation of carbon to structural material; - a greater element storage within biomass; and - the diversity of carbon- and nutrient-containing metabolites produced. The most important of these differences is structural material, which can lead to C:element ratios in biomass (as a whole) 100  greater than those in unicellular organisms. Stand allometry causes the amount of carbon stored and C:element ratios in biomass to change in predictable ways in the course of secondary succession. Such changes affect microbial dynamics and C:element interactions within soils. Bicarbonate, organic acids, nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate are major anions within forest soils: they control leaching of both anions and cations. Biotic interactions of C, N, P, and S during both uptake and mineralization control the potential for production of these anions within forests, and geochemical interactions regulate their mobility and loss. 
20519801|The affinity of iron oxides and hydroxides for phosphorus is thought to contribute to phosphorus limitation to net primary productivity in humid tropical forests on acidic, highly weathered soils. Perennially warm, humid conditions and high biological activity in these soils can result in fluctuating redox potential that in turn leads to considerable iron reduction in the presence of labile carbon and humic substances. We investigated the effects of reducing conditions in combination with the addition of labile carbon substrates (glucose and acetate) and an electron shuttle compound on iron reduction and phosphorus release in a humid tropical forest soil. Glucose or acetate was added to soils as a single dose at the beginning of the experiment, and as pulsed inputs over time, which more closely mimics patterns in labile carbon availability. Iron reduction and phosphorus mobilization were weakly stimulated by a single low level addition of carbon, and the addition of the electron shuttle compound with or without added carbon. Pulsed labile carbon additions produced a significant increase in soil pH, soluble iron, and phosphorus concentrations. Pulsed labile carbon inputs also promoted the precipitation of ferrous hydroxide complexes which could increase the capacity for P sorption, although our results suggest that rates of P solubilization exceeded re-adsorption. Plant and microbial P demand are also likely to serve as an important sinks for released P, limiting the role of P re-adsorption. Our results suggest that reducing conditions coupled with periodic carbon inputs can stimulate iron reduction and a corresponding increase in soil phosphorus mobilization, which may provide a source of phosphorus to plants and microorganisms previously undocumented in these ecosystems.

40343565|NO production from denitrification in soils contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect and the destruction of the stratospheric ozone. Ungulate grazing affects denitrification and the production of NO. The short-term effect of grazing on denitrification and NO production has been examined in several grassland ecosystems. However, the effects of long-term grazing have rarely been studied. We measured denitrification and NO production during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons in a long-term (17 years) experiment that had five grazing intensities (GI; 0.00, 1.33, 2.67, 4.00 and 5.33 sheep ha). We found that denitrification and NO production rates were seasonally variable during the measurement period, with higher values observed in summer and lower values found in spring and autumn. The grazed treatments resulted in decreased denitrification and NO production, primarily due to the reduced soil nitrate concentration and organic N content under the long-term grazing. This supported our hypothesis that long-term over-grazing suppresses denitrification and NO production. Although significant differences in denitrification and NO production were not found between the four GI, there was a general trend that cumulative denitrification and NO production decreased as grazing intensity increased, especially in 2006. Lower N losses via denitrification and the reduced soil nitrate concentration and organic N content under the long-term grazing.

Lower  losses via denitrification and NO production in the grazed plots, to some extent, may contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission and help to preserve soil N and ameliorate the negative impacts of grazing on plant growth, productivity, and ecological restoration processes in the temperate steppe in northern China. production in the grazed plots, to some extent, may contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission and help to preserve soil N and ameliorate the negative impacts of grazing on plant growth, productivity, and ecological restoration processes in the temperate steppe in northern China.
1469205| A total of 30 coniferous forest sites representing two productivity classes, forest types, were investigated on a temperature gradient (effective temperature sum using +5 C threshold 800-1300 degree-days and annual mean temperature -0.6-+3.9 C) in Finland for studying the effect of thermoclimate on the soil C storage. Other soil forming factors were standardized within the forest types so that the variation in the soil C density could be related to temperature. According to the applied regression model, the C density of the 0-1 m mineral soil layer increased 0.266 kg m<sup>-2</sup> for every 100 degree-day increase in the temperature sum, and the layer contained 57% and 28% more C under the warmest conditions of the gradient compared to the coolest in the less and more productive forest type, respectively. Accordingly, this soil layer was estimated to contain 23% more C in a new equilibrium with a 4 C higher annual mean temperature in Finland. The C density of the organic layer was not associated with temperature. Both soil layers contained more C at the sites of the more productive forest type, and the forest type explained 36% and 70% of the variation in the C density of the organic and 0-1 m layers, respectively. Within the forest types, the temperature sum accounted for 33-41% of the variation in the 0-1 m layer. These results suggest that site productivity is a cause for the large variation in the soil C density within the boreal zone, and relating the soil C density to site productivity and temperature would help to estimate the soil C reserves more accurately in the boreal zone. 
1469100| This study examines dissolved O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> in waters of the Pantanal, a vast savanna floodplain in Brazil. Measurements are presented for 540 samples from throughout the region, ranging from areas of sheet flooding to sluggish marsh streams to the major rivers of the region. Dissolved O<sub>2</sub> is often strongly depleted, particularly in waters filled with emergent vascular plants, which are the most extensive aquatic environment of the region. Median O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were 35 M for vegetated waters, 116 M for the Paraguay River, 95 M for tributary rivers, and 165 M for open lakes (atmospheric equilibrium, 230-290 M). Air-water diffusive fluxes were calculated from dissolved gas concentrations for representative vegetated floodplain waters, based on data collected over the course of an annual cycle. These fluxes reveal about twice as much CO<sub>2</sub> evasion as can be accounted for by invasion of O<sub>2</sub> (overall means in nmol cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>: O<sub>2</sub> 0.18, CO<sub>2</sub> 0.34, and CH<sub>4</sub> 0.017). Methanogenesis is estimated to account for ca. 20% of the total heterotrophic metabolism in the water column and sediments, with the remainder likely due mostly to aerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration is limited by the low concentrations of alternate electron acceptors. We hypothesize that O<sub>2</sub> transported through the stems of emergent plants is consumed in aerobic respiration by plant tissues or microorganisms, producing CO<sub>2</sub> that preferentially dissolves into the water, and thus explaining most of the excess CO<sub>2</sub> evasion. This hypothesis is supported by measurements of gases in submersed stems of emergent plants. 
20456399|Since the decomposition rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) varies as a function of environmental conditions, global climate change is expected to alter SOC decomposition dynamics, and the resulting changes in the amount of CO emitted from soils will feedback onto the rate at which climate change occurs. While this soil feedback is expected to be significant because the amount of SOC is substantially more than the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, the environmental dependencies of decomposition at global scales that determine the magnitude of the soil feedback have remained poorly characterized. In this study, we address this issue by fitting a mechanistic decomposition model to a global dataset of SOC, optimizing the model's temperature and moisture dependencies to best match the observed global distribution of SOC. The results of the analysis indicate that the temperature sensitivity of decomposition at global scales (Q=1.37) is significantly less than is assumed by many terrestrial ecosystem models that directly apply temperature sensitivity from small-scale studies, and that the maximal rate of decomposition occurs at higher moisture values than is assumed by many models. These findings imply that the magnitude of the soil decomposition feedback onto rate of global climate change will be less sensitive to increases in temperature, and modeling of temperature and moisture dependencies of SOC decomposition in global-scale models should consider effects of scale.

20519835|Atmospheric nitrogen deposition is anticipated to increase over the next decades with possible implications for future forest-atmosphere interactions. Increased soil NO emissions, depressed CH uptake and depressed soil respiration CO loss is considered a likely response to increased N deposition. This study examined fluxes of NO, CH and CO over two growing seasons from soils in unmanaged forest and grassland communities on abandoned agricultural areas in Michigan. All sites were subject to simulated increased N-deposition in the range of 1-3 g N m annually. Nitrous oxide fluxes and soil N concentrations in coniferous and grassland sites were on the whole unaffected by the increased N-inputs. It is noteworthy though that NO emissions increased three-fold in the coniferous sites in the first growing season in response to the low N treatment, although the response was barely significant (p &lt; 0.06). In deciduous forests, we observed increased levels of soil mineral N during the second year of N fertilization, however NO fluxes did not increase. Rates of methane oxidation were similar in all sites with no affect of field N application. Likewise, we did not observe any changes in soil CO efflux in response to N additions. The combination of tillage history and vegetation type was important for the trace gas fluxes, i.e. soil CO efflux was greater in successional grassland sites compared with the forested sites and CH uptake was reduced in post-tillage coniferous- and successional sites compared with the old-growth deciduous site. Our results indicate that short-term increased N availability influenced individual processes linked to trace gas turnover in the soil independently from the ecosystem N status. However, changes in whole system fluxes were not evident and were very likely mediated by competitive N uptake processes.

1469652| The vertical distributions of ethylene and methane in the upper water column of the subtropical Atlantic were measured along a transect from Madeira to the Caribbean and compared with temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Methane concentrations between 41.6 and 60.7 nL L<sup>-1</sup> were found in the upper 20 m of the water column giving a calculated average flux of methane into the atmosphere of 0.82 g m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Methane profiles reveal several distinct maxima in the upper 500 m of the water column and short-time variations which are presumably partly related to the vertical migration of zooplankton. Ethylene concentrations in near surface waters varied in the range of 1.8 to 8.2 nL L<sup>-1</sup>. Calculated flux rates for ethylene into the atmosphere were in the range of 0.41 to 1.35 g m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> with a mean of 0.83 g m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Maximum concentrations of up to 39.2 nL L<sup>-1</sup> were detected directly below the pycnocline in the western Atlantic. The vertical distributions of ethylene generally showed one maximum at the pycnocline (about 100 m depth) where elevated concentrations of chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients were also found; no ethylene was detected below 270 m depth. This suggests that ethylene release is mainly related to one, probably phytoplankton associated, source, while for methane, enhanced net production occurs at various depth horizons. For surface waters, a simple correlation between ethylene and chlorophyll-a or DOC concentrations could not be observed. No considerable diurnal variation was observed for the distribution and concentration of ethylene in the upper water column. 
20456424|Previous research indicates that transition between lowland heath and scrub ecosystems depends upon soil phosphorus (P) sorption capacity (PSC). Experimental work found a positive relationship between P availability and tree invasion but the relationship between PSC, P availability and scrub invasion is poorly understood making it difficult to clearly link landscape invasion patterns with small-scale experimental findings. Using a combination of descriptive and experimental studies we re-examined the relationship between PSC and tree invasion and investigated the hypothesis that PSC is a key determinant of P retention and therefore the P available to scrub colonists. In a statistical model fitted to soil data from three regions soil organic matter (SOM) content explained most of the variation in available P but PSC also accounted for a significant portion of the variance. Additional models suggest that soil P saturation and the proportion of available P in water desorbable form, both indicators of leaching losses, are strongly dependent on PSC. These findings are supported by experimental results; there was greater retention of added P, in plant available form, on high PSC soils and low PSC soils saturated at lower levels of addition. When synthesized with existing data, these results demonstrate that the relationship between PSC and P availability operates via a variety of mechanisms and at several spatio-temporal scales. PSC may for instance, influence post-disturbance SOM accumulation rates. Therefore PSC, by controlling P-availability and ecosystem development, may control the propensity of a site to either heath or scrub.
1468966|The organic carbon cycle of a shallow, tundra lake (mean depth 1.45 m) was followed for 5 weeks of the open water period by examining CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes through benthic respiration and anaerobic decomposition, photosynthesis of benthic and phytoplankton communities and gas exchange at the air-water interface. Total photosynthesis (as consumption of carbon dioxide) was 37.5 mmole C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, 83% of which was benthic and macrophytic. By direct measurement benthic respiration exceeded benthic photosynthesis by 6.6 mmole C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. The lake lost 1.4 10<sup>6</sup> moles C in two weeks after ice melted by degassing CO<sub>2</sub>, and 6.8 mmole C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>(1.5 10<sup>6</sup> moles) during the remainder of the open water period; 2.2 mmole C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> of this was release of CO<sub>2</sub> stored in the sediments by cryoconcentration the previous winter. Anaerobic microbial decomposition was only 4% of the benthic aerobic respiration rate of 38 mmole C m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. An annual budget estimate for the lake indicated that 50% of the carbon was produced by the benthic community, 20% by phytoplankton, and 30% was allochthonous material. The relative contribution of allochthonous input was in accordance with measurement of the  <sup>15</sup>N of sedimented organic matter.
20519860|Oxidation-reduction properties of surface sediments are tightly associated with the geochemistry of substances, and reducing organic substances (ROS) from hydrophytes residues may play an important role in these processes. In this study, composition, dynamics, and properties of ROS from anaerobic decomposition of Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, Potamogenton crispus Linn, Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara, Lemna trisulca Linn and Microcystis flos-aquae (Wittr) Kirch were investigated using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The type of hydrophytes determined both the reducibility and composition of ROS. At the peak time of ROS production, the anaerobic decomposition of M. flos-aquae produced 6 types of ROS, among which 3 belonged to strongly reducing organic substance (SROS), whereas there were only 3-4 types of ROS from the other hydrophytes, 2 of them exhibiting strong reducibility. The order of potential of hydrophytes to produce ROS was estimated to be: M. flos-aquae &gt; E. crassipes &gt; L. trisulca &gt; P. crispus  V. natans, based on the summation of SROS and weakly reducing organic substances (WROS). The dynamic pattern of SROS production was greatly different from WROS. The total SROS appeared periodic fluctuation with reducibility gradually weakening with incubation time, whereas the total WROS increased with incubation time. Reducibility of ROS from hydrophytes was readily affected by acid, base and ligands, suggesting that their properties were related to these aspects. In addition to the reducibility, we believe that more attention should be paid to the other behaviors of ROS in surface sediments.
23359748|The Angora Fire (summer of 2007) was the largest and most severe wildfire in recent history within the Lake Tahoe basin of the Sierra Nevada. To determine the watershed response and to assess the potential for downstream impacts of nutrient and sediment delivery to Lake Tahoe, we monitored the post-fire hydrology and stream water chemistry for 2 years at four locations along the length of Angora Creek, a perennial stream draining the burned watershed. When compared with unburned streams, the hydrology of Angora Creek indicated an earlier and faster melting of the spring snowpack. Peak stream water concentrations of total N (TN) and ammonium occurred within the burned area, whereas peak concentrations of nitrate (NO 3 - ), total P, soluble reactive P, total suspended solids, turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), and dissolved organic C occurred below the burned area. In comparison to pre-fire data, TN, NO 3 - , TP, total dissolved P, EC, and turbidity increased following the fire, particularly in the wetter second year. Yields for subwatershed areas suggest that the burned urban subwatershed was the largest source of nutrients and sediments, whereas the wet meadow subwatershed downstream of the burned area retained materials. Erosion control efforts, below-average annual precipitation and the timing of its arrival (absence of summer and fall rainstorms), and the existence of a wet meadow below the burned watershed likely reduced the negative impacts that would have been expected from such a severe wildfire.

Denitrification rates were measured monthly in laboratory-incubated sediment cores by using a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to assess net water-borne N flux from the cores. Annual average rates of denitrification in three intertidal riparian habitats, emergent marsh, mudflat, and hardwood forest, were 1864, 1956, and 2018 g m h, respectively. Laboratory experiments and in-situ monitoring revealed that the temporal lag between tidal inundation and reduced, denitrifying conditions was 4-5 h. Field measurements and remotely sensed data showed that the inundated surface area during high tide was three times greater than that at low tide. By combining data on denitrification, oxidationreduction potential, and topography, the model predicted that the daily denitrification flux constituted 2-15% of the daily riverine nitrate flux during most of the year and > 100% during low discharge periods. Current regional and global nitrogen budgets thus may overestimate nitrogen delivery to the ocean by not accounting for the TFZ denitrification.
1469690|The eastern U.S. receives elevated rates of N deposition compared to preindustrial times, yet relatively little of this N is exported in drainage waters. Net uptake of N into forest biomass and soils could account for a substantial portion of the difference between N deposition and solution exports. We quantified forest N sinks in biomass accumulation and harvest export for 16 large river basins in the eastern U.S. with two separate approaches: (1) using growth data from the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, and (2) using a model of forest nitrogen cycling (PnET-CN) linked to FIA information on forest age-class structure. The model was also used to quantify N sinks in soil and dead wood, and nitrate losses below the rooting zone. Both methods agreed that net growth rates were highest in the relatively young forests on the Schuylkill watershed, and lowest in the cool forests of northern Maine. Across the 16 watersheds, wood export removed an average of 2.7 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (range: 1-5 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), and standing stocks increased by 4.0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (-3 to 8 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Together, these sinks for N in woody biomass amounted to a mean of 6.7 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (2-9 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), or 73% (15-115%) of atmospheric N deposition. Modeled rates of net N sinks in dead wood and soil were small; soils were only a significant net sink for N during simulations of reforestation of degraded agricultural sites. Predicted losses of nitrate depended on the combined effects of N deposition, and both short- and long-term effects of disturbance. Linking the model with forest inventory information on age-class structure provided a useful step toward incorporating realistic patterns of forest disturbance status across the landscape.
20055246|Depth profiles of oxygen concentration and the redox status of acid-extractable iron were measured in littoral sediment cores of Lake Constance after mechanical removal of surface sediment, mixing, and re-deposition. In undisturbed sediment cores, oxygen penetrated down to 2.9  0.4 mm or 4.6  0.4 mm depth, respectively, after 12 h of incubation in the dark or light; causing a net diffusive flux of 108  20 nmol
24715326|Grasslands store substantial amounts of carbon in the form of organic matter in soil and roots. At high latitudes and elevation, turnover of these materials is slow due to various interacting biotic and abiotic constraints. Reliable estimates on the future of belowground carbon storage in cold grassland soils thus require quantitative understanding of these factors. We studied carbon turnover of roots, labile coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM) and older non-cPOM along a natural pH gradient (3.95.9) in a subalpine grassland by utilizing soil fractionation and radiocarbon dating. Soil carbon stocks and root biomass, turnover, and decomposability did not scale with soil pH whereas means residence times of both soil organic matter fractions significantly increased with declining pH. The effect was twice as strong for non-cPOM, which was also stronger enriched in N at low pH. Considering roots as important precursors for cPOM, the weaker soil pH effect on cPOM turnover may have been driven by comparably high root pH values. At pH < 5, long non-cPOM mean residence times were probably related to pH dependent changes in substrate availability. Differences in turnover along the pH gradient were not reflected in soil carbon stocks because aboveground productivity was lower under acidic conditions and, in turn, higher inputs from aboveground plant residues compensated for faster soil carbon turnover at less acidic pH. In summary, the study provides evidence for a strong and differential regulatory role of pH on the turnover of soil organic matter that needs consideration in studies aiming to quantify effects of changing environmental conditions on belowground carbon storage.
1469005| Cycling dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were examined in Lake Pontchartrain estuary, Louisiana, in relation to changes in freshwater inputs. DOC concentrations ranged from 5.3 to 8.5 mg C L<sup>-1</sup> reaching their highest during high river inflow. The percentage of DOC represented by HMW DOC (or colloidal material) was greatest (ca. 11%) at stations where freshwater discharge from rivers and surrounding wetlands was most significant. Moreover, the lignin-phenol content of this material ( ranged from 0.09 to 0.33 and  from 0.11 to 0.39) confirmed that a significant fraction of colloidal organic carbon was derived from terrestrial sources. Riverine and benthic fluxes represented the dominant sources of DOC to the estuary. On an annual basis, riverine and benthic DOC concentrations were estimated to be 2.8 10<sup>10</sup> g C yr<sup>-1</sup> and 8.8 10<sup>10</sup> g C yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, while the total DOC pool in the estuary was 3.8 10<sup>10</sup> g C. Annual average concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (1298 M) and pCO<sub>2</sub> (5774 atm) were comparable to those found in other freshwater systems that reached CO<sub>2</sub> saturation levels. Net losses of DOC in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary appeared to be primarily controlled by heterotrophic consumption (conversion of CO<sub>2</sub>) -- which may have been amplified by the long residence time (approximately 120 days) of DOC in this system. 
1469496|Pore-water concentrations of inorganic solutes were measured at four locations in a recent sedimentation area of the river Meuse in The Netherlands. The pore-water concentration profiles were interpreted using the steady state one-dimensional reaction/transport model STEADY SED1. This model explicitly accounts for the organic matter degradation pathways and secondary redox reactions. Results show that the model reproduces the measured pore-water profiles of redox species reasonably well, although significant divergence is observed for pH. The latter is due to the absence of pH buffering by CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the model. At all locations, methanogenesis is the major pathway of organic matter degradation below 3 cm from the sediment-water interface. However, organic matter degradation rates by methanogenesis may be overestimated, because methane ebullition is not included. Differences in profiles of redox-sensitive ions among the four locations are explained by differences in depositional conditions, in particular the sediment accumulation rate and supply of organic matter.
1468960|The relative importance of potential carbon sources in the littoral of Lake Gooimeer, a lake in the centre of the Netherlands, was studied using a combination of <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C-ratio analysis and carbohydrate composition analysis. The littoral is covered on the land side by a 80 m wide Phragmites australis bed. Potential carbon sources were macrophyte litter, seston and benthic algae. Samples of potential carbon sources, sediments and benthic macrofauna from inside and outside the bed were analyzed for their <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C-ratio and some for their carbohydrate composition. Results indicate that inside the bed, macrophyte litter was the main source of carbon for both the sediment organic matter and the benthic macrofauna, and that algal material was of minor importance. Outside the bed, production by benthic algae was the main carbon source, with seston as a second source. No macrophyte derived material could be detected outside the reed bed.
1468889|A procedure which includes the Total Reduced Inorganic Sulfur (TRIS) in a single distillation step is described for the radiotracer measurement of sulfate reduction in sediments. The TRIS includes both Acid Volatile Sulfide (AVS: H<sub>2</sub>S+FeS) and the remaining Chromium Reducible Sulfur (CRS: S<sup>0</sup>, FeS<sub>2</sub>). The single-step distillation was simpler and faster than the consecutive distillations of AVS and CRS. It also resulted in higher (4-50%) sulfate reduction rates than those obtained from the sum of <sup>35</sup>S in AVS and CRS. The difference was largest when the sediment had been dried after AVS but before CRS distillation. Relative to the <sup>35</sup>S-AVS distillation alone, the <sup>35</sup>S-TRIS single-step distallation yielded 8-87% higher reduction rates. The separation and recovery of FeS, S<sup>0</sup> and FeS<sub>2</sub> was studied under three distillation conditions: 1) cold acid, 2) cold acid with Cr<sup>2+</sup>, and 3) hot acid with Cr<sup>2+</sup>. The FeS was recovered by cold acid alone while pyrite was recovered by cold acid with Cr<sup>2+</sup>. A smaller S<sup>0</sup> fraction, presumably of the finer crystal sizes, was recovered also in the cold acid with Cr<sup>2+</sup> while most of the S<sup>0</sup> required hot acid with Cr<sup>2+</sup> for reduction to H<sub>2</sub>S.
1468873|The denitrifying activity was measured in different types of sediment from the Mediterranean coast of France before, and after, a massive contamination (30-100 g kg<sup>-1</sup> sediment) of hydrocarbons. A closed system was used in order to maintain anoxic conditions and to control substrates and gaseous products concentrations. We have demonstrated that the respiratory metabolism was inhibited in all cases following an incubation time of 20 to 50 days. At this time, the addition of lactate restore the denitrifying activity. The inhibitory effect of crude oil was not related to an alteration of bacterial cells, but to changes in environmental conditions allowing denitrification. The presence of hydrocarbons in the sediments causes a decrease in the redox potential and a concomitant stimulation of the sulfate reduction.
24716790|Major ion and mercury (Hg) inputs to terrestrial ecosystems include both wet and dry deposition (total deposition). Estimating total deposition to sensitive receptor sites is hampered by limited information regarding its spatial heterogeneity and seasonality. We used measurements of throughfall flux, which includes atmospheric inputs to forests and the net effects of canopy leaching or uptake, for ten major ions and Hg collected during 35 time periods in 1999-2005 at over 70 sites within Acadia National Park, Maine to (1) quantify coherence in temporal dynamics of seasonal throughfall deposition and (2) examine controls on these patterns at multiple scales. We quantified temporal coherence as the correlation between all possible site pairs for each solute on a seasonal basis. In the summer growing season and autumn, coherence among pairs of sites with similar vegetation was stronger than for site-pairs that differed in vegetation suggesting that interaction with the canopy and leaching of solutes differed in coniferous, deciduous, mixed, and shrub or open canopy sites. The spatial pattern in throughfall hydrologic inputs across Acadia National Park was more variable during the winter snow season, suggesting that snow re-distribution affects net hydrologic input, which consequently affects chemical flux. Sea-salt corrected calcium concentrations identified a shift in air mass sources from maritime in winter to the continental industrial corridor in summer. Our results suggest that the spatial pattern of throughfall hydrologic flux, dominant seasonal air mass source, and relationship with vegetation in winter differ from the spatial pattern of throughfall flux in these solutes in summer and autumn. The coherence approach applied here made clear the strong influence of spatial heterogeneity in throughfall hydrologic inputs and a maritime air mass source on winter patterns of throughfall flux. By contrast, vegetation type was the most important influence on throughfall chemical flux in summer and autumn.
1468659|In an oligotrophic moorland pool in The Netherlands, S cycling near the sediment/water boundary was investigated by measuring (1) SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction rates in the sediment, (2) depletion of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the overlying water column and (3) release of <sup>35</sup>S from the sediment into the water column. Two locations differing in sediment type (highly organic and sandy) were compared, with respect to reduction rates and depletion of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the overlying water. Sulfate reduction rates in sediments of an oligotrophic moorland pool were estimated by diagenetic modelling and whole core <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> injection. Rates of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> consumption in the overlying water were estimated by changes in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration over time in in situ enclosures. Reduction rates ranged from 0.27-11.2 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Rates of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> uptake from the enclosed water column varied from -0.5, -0.3 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> (November) to 0.43-1.81 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> (July, August and April). Maximum rates of oxidation to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in July 1990 estimated by combination of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction rates and rates of in situ SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> uptake in the enclosed water column were 10.3 and 10.5 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> at an organic rich and at a sandy site respectively. Experiments with <sup>35</sup>S<sup>2-</sup> and <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> tracer suggested (1) a rapid formation of organically bound S from dissimilatory reduced SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and (2) the presence of mainly non SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-S derived from reduced S transported from the sediment into the overlying water. A <sup>35</sup>S<sup>2-</sup> tracer experiment showed that about 7% of <sup>35</sup>S<sup>2-</sup> injected at 1 cm depth in a sediment core was recovered in the overlying water column. Sulfate reduction rates in sediments with higher volumetric mass fraction of organic matter did not significantly differ from those in sediments with a lower mass fraction of organic matter.
23359728|Litter decomposition contributes to one of the largest fluxes of carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and is a primary control on nutrient cycling. The inability of models using climate and litter chemistry to predict decomposition in dry environments has stimulated investigation of non-traditional drivers of decomposition, including photodegradation, the abiotic decomposition of organic matter via exposure to solar radiation. Recent work in this developing field shows that photodegradation may substantially influence terrestrial C fluxes, including abiotic production of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Research has also produced contradictory results regarding controls on photodegradation. Here we summarize the state of knowledge about the role of photodegradation in litter decomposition and C cycling and investigate drivers of photodegradation across experiments using a meta-analysis. Overall, increasing litter exposure to solar radiation increased mass loss by 23% with large variation in photodegradation rates among and within ecosystems. This variation was tied to both litter and environmental characteristics. Photodegradation increased with litter C to nitrogen (N) ratio, but not with lignin content, suggesting that we do not yet fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Photodegradation also increased with factors that increased solar radiation exposure (latitude and litter area to mass ratio) and decreased with mean annual precipitation. The impact of photodegradation on C (and potentially N) cycling fundamentally reshapes our thinking of decomposition as a solely biological process and requires that we define the mechanisms driving photodegradation before we can accurately represent photodegradation in global C and N models.
1469612|We have evaluated photoeffects of UV-B, UV-A and PAR radiation on dissolved organic matter (DOM). Photochemical production of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was measured in sterile lake water from Sweden and Brazil after 6 hours of sun exposure. Tubes were exposed to four solar radiation regimes: Full-radiation, Full-radiation minus UV-B, Full-radiation minus UV-B and UV-A (PAR) and darkness. In both areas, lakes with most DOC (varying between 3 and 40 mg Cl<sup>-1</sup>) were highly humic, resulting in high UV-B attenuation coefficients (K<sub>d</sub>=5-466 m<sup>-1</sup>). Under Full-radiation, photooxidative DIC-production varied from 0.09 to 1.7 mg Cl<sup>-1</sup> per 6 h, without UV-B from 0.07 to 1.4 mg Cl<sup>-1</sup> and with PAR only from 0.02 to 0.7 mg Cl<sup>-1</sup>. UV-B radiation explains a minor part (17%) of the photooxidative DIC-production, while UV-A and PAR have larger effects (39% and 44%, respectively). Photooxidation was proportional to DOC-content and DIC-production was positively related to decrease in DOC and to loss of absorbance at 250 nm. There was no significant difference in DOC and radiation normalized DIC-production between Swedish and Brazilian lakes. The UV-B dose during incubations was approximately 3 times higher in Brazil compared to Sweden, while UV-A and PAR doses were similar. We conclude that DOC from tropical and temperate freshwaters do not seem to differ with respect to sensitivity to photooxidation.
1469186|A simple heuristic theory based on conservation of matter and describing the fate of autotrophic production in pelagic ecosystems was developed to assist in conceptualizing how zooplankton affect sedimentation processes in lakes and oceans. The theory predicted that effects of zooplankton on the fraction of autotrophic incorporation that sediments (the "export ratio") will be a function of factors related both to zooplankton digestion and egestion and to tendencies of particulate matter to sediment directly prior to mineralization. As a result, effects of zooplankton grazing on the export ratio were predicted to be site-dependent, a function of physical conditions and zooplankton communities characterizing an ecosystem. The theory was tested by monitoring autotrophic production of C, N, and P, sedimentation of C, N, and P, and zooplankton biomass in two lakes of the Canadian shield characterized by contrasting morphometry and food-web structure. In Lake 110, a small elongate lake protected from wind exposure, export ratios of C, N, and P declined strongly with zooplankton biomass. In contrast, in L240, a larger lake with considerably greater wind exposure, export ratios increased with zooplankton biomass. These results were consistent with predictions of our theory that effects of zooplankton on sedimentation processes will depend on the tendency of particulate matter to directly sediment relative to the tendency of egested materials to sediment. However, no significant differences in relationships between export ratios for C, N, and P and zooplankton biomass were found.
1469916| The influence of the colonization of salt marsh sediments with Halimione portulacoides, on the composition of the sedimentary humic acids was evaluated. For this purpose, cores of colonized and non-colonized sediments from a salt marsh in Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) were collected, and the humic acids of different layers were extracted and characterized by Fourier transform infrared, synchronous molecular fluorescence ( = 60 nm) and UV-visible spectroscopies and also by elemental analysis. The infrared spectra suggest the presence of more peptide residues and carbohydrates in the sedimentary humic acids from surface and around the plant roots at the site colonized by H. portulacoides, when compared with the humic acids from the depth-equivalent sediment layers at the non-colonized site. The higher content of protein-type materials is confirmed by the lowest values of C/N ratios and the highest relative intensities of a band at  <sub>exc</sub> = 280 nm in the fluorescence spectra. The lowest  <sub>280</sub> values obtained in the UV-visible spectra, and the infrared spectra suggest a lower aromatic content of the humic acids from the colonized site. 
1469705|The de novo formation of organochlorines was observed in a municipal sewage treatment plant. Due to this formation, the amount of organically bound halogens (AOX) increased 15-fold inside the sewage treatment plant. Per day, more than 6 kg of organically-bound chlorine were produced. This formation is not based on a metabolism of present organochlorines, it is a de novo formation out of inorganic chloride and organic substrates. The AOX trigger concentration in sewage sludge in Germany is 500 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and was sometimes exceeded by a factor of 10. No known anthropogenic organohalogens were found which could explain the elevated AOX concentrations. Instead many chlorinated compounds could be identified which were not known to be of anthropogenic origin. The compound with the highest concentration was the 3,4-dichlorophenylacetic acid (3,4-CPAc). In one case, more than 1 g kg<sup>-1</sup> of this compound was detected. A slaughterhouse that emits phenylacetic acid is probably the origin of that formation. In model experiments phenylacetic acid was chlorinated with HOCl but chlorinated phenylacetic acids other than 3,4-CPAc were found. Therefore it can be excluded that the chlorination in the sewage treatment plant takes place by an abiotic reaction with hypochlorite that might have been introduced there. We assume that the occurring microorganisms are responsible for the de novo formation in the sewage treatment plant. The obtained knowledge could also be useful to understand natural chlorination processes.
1469180|Nitrate reduction and denitrification were measured in swamp forest streams draining lowland rain forest on Costa Rica's Atlantic slope foothills using the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-block assay and sediment-water nutrient fluxes. Denitrification assays using the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-block technique indicated that the full suite of denitrifying enzymes were present in the sediment but that only a small fraction of the functional activity could be expressed without adding NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Under optimal conditions, denitrification enzyme activity averaged 15 nmoles cm<sup>-3</sup> sediment h<sup>-1</sup>. Areal NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction rates measured from NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> loss in the overlying water of sediment-water flux chambers ranged from 65 to 470 umoles m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Oxygen loss rates accompanying NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> depletion averaged 750 umoles m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Corrected for denitrification of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> oxidized from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the sediment, gross NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction rates increase by 130 umoles m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, indicating nitrification may be the predominant source of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction in swamp forest stream sediments. Under field conditions approximately 80% of the increase in inorganic N mass along a 1250-m reach of the Salto River was in the form of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> with the balance NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Scrutiny of potential inorganic N sources suggested that mineralized N released from the streambed was a major source of the inorganic N increase. Despite significant NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction potential, swamp forest stream sediments appear to be a source of inorganic N to downstream communities.
20055204|Past research strongly indicates the importance of amino acids in the N economy of the Arctic tundra, but little is known about the seasonal dynamics of amino acids in tundra soils. We repeatedly sampled soils from tussock, shrub, and wet sedge tundra communities in the summers of 2000 and 2001 and extracted them with water (HO) and potassium sulfate (KSO) to determine the seasonal dynamics of soil amino acids, ammonium (NH), nitrate (NO), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and phosphate (
20055301|Concentrations of metals cycle daily in the water column of some mining-impacted streams in the Rocky Mountains of the western USA. We hypothesized that biofilm in High Ore Creek, Montana, USA, sorbs and releases Zn on a diel cycle, and this uptake-and-release cycle controls the total and dissolved (0.45-m filtered) Zn concentrations. We collected water samples from three sites (upstream, middle and downstream at 0, 350 and 650 m, respectively) along a 650-m reach of High Ore Creek during a 47-h period in August 2002 and from the upstream and downstream sites during a 24-h period in August 2003; we also collected biofilm samples at these sites. In 2002 and 2003, total and dissolved Zn concentrations did not exhibit a diel cycle at the upstream sampling site, which was 30 m downstream from a settling pond through which the creek flows. However, total and dissolved Zn concentrations exhibited a diel cycle at the middle and downstream sampling sites, with the highest Zn concentrations occurring at dawn and the lowest Zn concentrations occurring during late afternoon (&gt 2-fold range of concentrations at the downstream site). Based on (1) concentrations of Zn in biofilm at the three sites and (2) results of streamside experiments that demonstrated Zn uptake and release by nave biofilm during the light and dark hours of a photocycle, respectively, we conclude that Zn uptake in photosynthetic biofilms could contribute a large percentage to the cycling of Zn concentrations in the water column in High Ore Creek.

20456512|Cold-season processes are known to contribute substantially to annual carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) budgets in continental high elevation and high-latitude soils, but their role in more temperate alpine ecosystems has seldom been characterized. We used a 4-month lab incubation to describe temperature (-2, 0, 5C) and moisture [50, 90% water-holding capacity (WHC)] effects on soil C and N dynamics in two wet and one dry meadow soil from the Sierra Nevada, California. The soils varied in their capacity to process N at and below 0C. Only the dry meadow soil mineralized N at -2C, but the wet meadow soils switched from net N consumption at -2C to net N mineralization at temperatures 0C. When the latter soils were incubated at -2C at either moisture level (50 or 90% WHC), net NO production decreased even as NH continued to accumulate. The same pattern occurred in saturated (90% WHC) soils at warmer temperatures (0C), suggesting that dissimilatory processes could control N cycling in these soils when they are frozen.
20519770|Leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the forest floor and transport in soil solution into the mineral soil are important for carbon cycling in boreal forest ecosystems. We examined DOC concentrations in bulk deposition, throughfall and in soil solutions collected under the O and B horizons in three Norway spruce stands along a climatic gradient in Sweden. Mean annual temperature for the three sites was 5.5, 3.4 and 1.2 C. At each site we also examined the effect of soil moisture on DOC dynamics along a moisture gradient (dry, mesic and moist plots). To obtain information about the fate of DOC leached from the O horizon into the mineral soil, C measurements were made on bulk organic matter and DOC. The concentration and fluxes of DOC in O horizon leachates were highest at the southern site and lowest at the northern. Average DOC concentrations at the southern, central and northern sites were 49, 39 and 30 mg l, respectively. We suggest that DOC leaching rates from O horizons were related to the net primary production of the ecosystem. Soil temperature probably governed the within-year variation in DOC concentration in O horizon leachates, but the peak in DOC was delayed relative to that of temperature, probably due to sorption processes. Neither soil moisture regime (dry, mesic or moist plots) nor seasonal variation in soil moisture seemed to be of any significance for the concentration of DOC leached from the O horizon. The C measurements showed that DOC in soil solution collected below the B horizon was derived mainly from the B horizon itself, rather than from the O horizon, indicating a substantial exchange (sorption-desorption reactions) between incoming DOC and soil organic carbon in the mineral soil.
1469472|Rhizospheric methane oxidation was evaluated at a Carex (spp.) dominated fen in Alberta, Canada over three growing seasons. Aerobic incubations of bulk peat and live roots in the laboratory show a clear association between active methane oxidizing bacteria and the rhizosphere. Aerobic incubations also show an oxidation potential that far exceeds methane production potential measured in the laboratory. Quantitative estimates of how this oxidation potential is expressed in situ depend strongly on which of two common approaches are used. (1) Subtracting in situ methane emission rates from methane production rates measured in the laboratory with anaerobic incubations suggest that methane oxidation may attenuate emissions by 58 to 92%. (2) Applying the inhibitor methyl fluoride (CH<sub>3</sub>F) to whole plants in situ suggest methane oxidation attenuates emissions by less than 20% seasonally. The production minus emission technique likely overestimates methane oxidation because methane production measured via anaerobic incubations in the laboratory are probably overstimates. Oxidation percentages measured by CH<sub>3</sub>F were greatest early in the growing season when emission rates were low and fell to almost nondetectable levels as emission rates peaked in late summer. Estimates provided by the CH<sub>3</sub>F technique were generally in better agreement with estimates of oxidation based on a stable isotope mass balance (0-34%) determined in a companion study (Popp et al. 1999).
1469346|The vegetation mosaic of the Alaskan taiga is produced by patterns of disturbance coupled to well-defined successional patterns. In primary succession on river floodplains, one of the critical transitions in succession is that from thinleaf alder (Alnus tenuifolia) to balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera). This is the shift from a N<sub>2</sub>-fixing shrub to a deciduous tree. Through this transition there are major changes in N cycling including a decrease in N<sub>2</sub>-fixation, mineralization, and nitrification. Most models of plant effects on soil processes assume that these changes are caused by shifts in litter quality and C/N ratio. This paper reviews several studies examining the effects of balsam poplar secondary chemicals on soil nutrient cycling. Balsam poplar tannins inhibited both N<sub>2</sub>-fixation in alder, and decomposition and N-mineralization in alder soils. Other poplar compounds, including low-molecular-weight phenolics, were microbial substrates and increased microbial growth and immobilization, thereby reducing net soil N availability. Thus, substantial changes in soil N cycling through succession appear to have been mediated by balsam poplar secondary chemicals.
1468761|The pH of sediments underlying acidified lake waters does not necessarily reflect the acidification of the water. Profiles of sediments in Lake Anna, Virginia showed interstitial pH values between 6.0 and 7.0 within the top 4 cm, even though the sediments are constantly exposed to overlying waters with pH values as low as 3.5. The amount of acidity neutralized by sediment processes is 2 orders of magnitude greater than previously reported observations. The results indicate that caution must be used in drawing conclusions about sediments biogeochemical processes based on the pH of overlying waters.
1469817|Phytoplankton (microalgae), seaweeds (macroalgae), higher plants and fungi produce halomethanes. Algae and fungi produce both methyl halides and polyhalomethanes, whereas plants are known to produce only methyl halides. Why these organisms produce halomethanes is a question frequently asked by chemists and biologists. This question implies that halomethanes have a function and have a selective value to the producing organism. Except for some fungi, the evolutionary advantage of producing halomethanes may not presently exist. Polyhalomethanes are by-products of halogenation of certain organic compounds by haloperoxidases in marine algae and perhaps some fungi, and they may be indirectly produced in aquatic environments by algal release of oxidized halogen species. A main function of this enzyme is to rid the cell of harmful oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. Monohalomethanes (methyl halides) are products of methyltransferase activity. It has been proposed that methyl halide production may provide a mechanism to regulate chloride levels in halotolerant plants. The examination of halide cellular concentrations, halomethane production rates, and enzyme characteristics raises questions about this possible function. In algae, plants and some fungi, methyl halides may be a result of the insertion of ubiquitous halides into the active site of numerous methyltransferases. Therefore, halomethanes may be by-products or 'accidents' of metabolism.
1469174|The influence of storm runoff processes on stream nitrogen dynamics was investigated in a headwater riparian swamp on the Oak Ridges moraine in southern Ontario. Hydrologic data were combined with analysis of an isotopic tracer (<sup>18</sup>0) and nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>,NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) concentrations in saturation overland flow and stream discharge. Storm runoff was separated into its event and pre-event components using <sup>18</sup>0 in order to examine the effect of water source on nitrogen chemistry. Laboratory experiments were also used to study nitrogen transformation associated with storm runoff-surface substrate interactions in the swamp. In most storms NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentrations in the initial 3-4 mm throughfall increment were 10-20x and 20-100x higher respectively than stream base flow concentrations. Maximum stream NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations were <2x to 6x higher than base flow concentrations and preceded or coincided with peak stream discharge. Storm-to-storm variations in stream NO<sub>3</sub>-N behaviour also occurred during the hydrograph recession phase. NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentrations attained an initial peak on the rising hydrograph limb, or at peak stream discharge. A second NH<sub>4</sub>-N increase occurred during the late recession phase 3-5 h after maximum stream discharge. Inorganic-N concentrations in surface runoff were similar to peak streamflow. The close agreement between observed NO<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations and values predicted from a chemical mixing model indicate that stream NO<sub>3</sub>-N variations were controlled mainly by the mixture of throughfall and groundwater in surface stormflow from the swamp. Laboratory experiments also indicated that NO<sub>3</sub>-N in surface runoff behaved conservatively when mixed with swamp substrates. With the exception of the late hydrograph recession phase, observed stream NH<sub>4</sub>-N concentrations were much lower than concentrations predicted by the chemical mixing model. The rapid loss of NH<sub>4</sub>-N from mixtures of surface stormflow and swamp substrates in laboratory experiments and the absence of uptake in sterilized substrates indicated that NH<sub>4</sub>-N retention in surface storm runoff was due to biotic processes.
23359755|Microbial oxidation in aerobic soils is the primary biotic sink for atmospheric methane (CH 4 ), a powerful greenhouse gas. Although tropical forest soils are estimated to globally account for about 28% of annual soil CH 4 consumption (6.2 Tg CH 4 year -1 ), limited data are available on CH 4 exchange from tropical montane forests. We present the results of an extensive study on CH 4 exchange from tropical montane forest soils along an elevation gradient (1,000, 2,000, 3,000 m) at different topographic positions (lower slope, mid-slope, ridge position) in southern Ecuador. All soils were net atmospheric CH 4 sinks, with decreasing annual uptake rates from 5.9 kg CH 4 C ha -1 year -1 at 1,000 m to 0.6 kg CH 4 C ha -1 year -1 at 3,000 m. Topography had no effect on soil atmospheric CH 4 uptake. We detected some unexpected factors controlling net methane fluxes: positive correlations between CH 4 uptake rates, mineral nitrogen content of the mineral soil and with CO 2 emissions indicated that the largest CH 4 uptake corresponded with favorable conditions for microbial activity. Furthermore, we found indications that CH 4 uptake was N limited instead of inhibited by NH 4 + . Finally, we showed that in contrast to temperate regions, substantial high affinity methane oxidation occurred in the thick organic layers which can influence the CH 4 budget of these tropical montane forest soils. Inclusion of elevation as a co-variable will improve regional estimates of methane exchange in these tropical montane forests.
40343568|We evaluated how litter raking removed basic nutrients from forest soils by simulating this historical silvicultural practice on two spruce stands (Picea abies) in the Czech Republic. Experimental litter raking depleted the soil pool of exchangeable base cation nutrients (Ca, Mg and K) by up to 31% after the first litter raking in 2003. A second litter raking in the following year further reduced the soil pool by up to 16%, and the third litter raking in 2005 reduced the pool by up to 6% more. These losses of base cations were substantially greater than their annual input into the forest soil (estimated as from total atmospheric deposition and mineral weathering) as well as their annual runoff. The concentration of Mg and Ca in spruce needless decreased considerably within 3 years from the beginning of the experiment. In addition, the observed litter chemistry was used to estimate historical nutrient removal from litter raking by applying them to historical records of litter removal rates. According to these calculations, the annual loss of total Ca, Mg and K from spruce stands would be from 40% to 100% of its present annual input into the soil, and from 50% to 190% of annual runoff. On the basis of previous results estimated by geochemical modeling, we found that the loss of base cations due to litter raking was similar to their leaching due to acid deposition. We conclude that long-term removal of litter as widely practiced throughout the 19th century in Central Europe may have been responsible for a loss of base cations equivalent to that caused by acid deposition during the 20th century.
20456422|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sediment porewaters from Lake Erhai, Southwest China was investigated using dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, UV absorbance, fluorescence and molecular weight distribution. DOC exhibited a high concentration at the sediment--water interface with a rapid decrease to the oxic-anoxic interface at approximately 7 cm, and then increased with depth. Similar trends were also found for the UV absorption coefficients at 254 and 280 nm in the porewaters. DNA in the sediment was also measured, which confirmed the high abundance of aerobic bacteria in the upper layer of the sediment. Both humic-like (peaks A and C) and protein-like (peaks B and D) fluorescence were observed in the porewater DOM, and their fluorescence intensities exhibited a similar porewater profile as DOC concentration. A strong correlation was found between the peak fluorescence intensity ratio r(A, C) and r(D, B). Both the fluorescence index and UV absorption coefficient at 254 nm suggested a dramatic increase in aromaticity of porewater DOM across the oxic-anoxic interface. Porewater DOM exhibited a multimodal distribution of molecular weight with a relatively low polydispersity. The results of this study offer significant insight into the nature and properties of DOM in freshwater ecosystems.
1468620|The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study was designed to evaluate element flux and cycling in a northern hardwood forest and the effects of disturbance on these processes. In the original experiment, an entire watershed was deforested and regrowth was inhibited for three years using herbicides. Initial effects of the treatment included: elevated stream discharge, large increases in streamwater solute concentrations and elevated losses of those ions from the watershed. In contrast, streamwater concentrations and net ecosystem output of sulfate decreased in response to the treatment. During the post treatment period, the concentrations of most dissolved ions declined relative to a reference watershed while, again in contrast, sulfate concentrations increased relative to the reference. In this paper we develop a hypothesis which links acidification and sulfate adsorption processes in the soil to explain the observed trends in sulfate losses from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.
41490531|Hood Canal, Washington, USA, is a poorly ventilated fjord-like sub-basin of Puget Sound that commonly experiences hypoxia. This study examined the influence of watershed soils, vegetation, physical features, and population density on nitrogen (N) export to Hood Canal from 43 tributaries. We also linked our watershed study to the estuary using a salinity mass balance model that calculated the relative magnitude of N loading to Hood Canal from watershed, direct precipitation, and marine sources. The overall flowweighted total dissolved N (TDN) and particulate N input concentrations to Hood Canal were 152 and 49 g l , respectively. Nitrate and dissolved organic N comprised 64 and 29% of TDN, respectively. The optimal regression models for TDN concentration and areal yield included a land cover term suggesting an effect of N-fixing red alder (Alnus rubra) and a human population density term (suggesting onsite septic system (OSS) discharges). There was pronounced seasonality in stream water TDN concentrations, particularly for catchments with a high prevalence of red alder, with the lowest concentrations occurring in the summer and the highest occurring in November-December. Due to strong seasonality in TDN concentrations and in particular stream flow, over 60% of the TDN export from this watershed occurred during the 3 month period of November-January. Entrainment of marine water into the surface layer of Hood Canal accounted for 98% of  loading to the euphotic zone of this estuary, and in a worst case scenario OSS  inputs contribute 0.5% of total  loading. Domestic wastewater discharges and red alders appear to be a very important  source for many streams, but a minor nutrient source for the estuary as a whole.
20055237|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important vehicle for the movement of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic systems. To investigate how the source and composition of aquatic DOM change in both space and time, we used chemical, spectroscopic, and isotopic analyses to characterize DOM in a headwater catchment in the Colorado Front Range. Streamwater samples for DOM analyses were collected from 2 sites, a lightly vegetated alpine site and a forested, subalpine site, in the North Boulder Creek catchment during the snowmelt runoff season (May-September). Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) peaked on the ascending limb of the snowmelt hydrograph at both the alpine (
24715342|Stable isotopes of nitrogen (N) in plants are increasingly used to evaluate ecosystem N cycling patterns. A basic assumption in this research is that plant N reflects the N of the N source. Recent evidence suggests that plants may fractionate on uptake, transport, or transformation of N. If the dominant source of plant N is via roots, a difference in N by tissue type would suggest fractionation on transport and assimilation of N. In order to evaluate differences between species and plant parts, we measured N in root, stem, and leaf tissues of individual sugar maple (Acer saccharum; SM) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia; BE) plants ranging in age from germinants to mature trees at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire (USA). For SM, root N > stem N > leaf N; for BE seedlings, root N > stem N and root N > leaf N. These differences suggest that fractionation occurs during plant transport and assimilation of N. Beech N (root, stem, and leaf) was consistently higher than SM N for 17 year-old seedlings. At one site, we found no differences with age in foliar N (range: 4.14.8 ) for seedlings, saplings, and trees which suggests that it may be possible to compare foliar N of plants of different ages at some sites. However, at another site, foliar and root N were higher for trees than 12 year-old seedlings. This study suggests that physiological differences in N assimilation and transport processes that differ by species likely control plant N.
1469083|Dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in chronosequences of soils below forests that had been replaced by grazed pastures 3-25 years ago, were investigated for two contrasting soil types (Andic Humitropept and Eutric Hapludand) in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. By forest clearing and subsequent establishment of pastures, photosynthesis changes from a C-3 to a C-4 pathway. The accompanying changes in C-input and its  <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>14</sup>C signals, were used to quantify SOC dynamics. C-input from root turnover at a pasture site was measured by sequential harvesting and <sup>14</sup>C-pulse labelling. With a spatial resolution of 5 cm, data on total SOC,  <sup>13</sup>C and  <sup>14</sup>C of soil profiles were interpreted with a model that distinguishes three pools of SOC 'active' C, 'slow' C and 'passive' C, each with a l<sup>-st</sup> order decomposition rate (k<sub>a</sub>, k<sub>s</sub> and k<sub>p</sub>). The model includes carbon isotope fractionation and depth-dependent decomposition rates. Transport of C between soil layers was described as a diffusion process, which accounts for physical and biotic mixing processes. Calibrated diffusion coefficients were 0.42 cm<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for the Humitropept and 3.97 cm<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for the Hapludand chronosequence. Diffusional transport alone was insufficient for optimal simulation; it had to be augmented by depth-dependent decomposition rates to explain the dynamics of SOC,  <sup>13</sup>C and  <sup>14</sup>C. Decomposition rates decreased strongly with depth. Upon increased diffusion, differences between calibrated decomposition rates of SOC fractions between surface soils and subsoils diminished, but the concept of depth-dependent decomposition had to be retained, to obtain small residuals between observed and simulated data. At a reference depth of 15-20 cm k<sub>s</sub> was 90 yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Humitropept and 146 yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Hapludand. Slow C contributed most to total organic C in surface soils, whereas passive C contributed most below 40 cm depth. After 18-25 years of pasture, net loss of C was 2180 g C m<sup>-2</sup> for the Hapludand and 150 g m<sup>-2</sup> for the Humitropept soil.
24716783|Wet N deposition comprises oxidised (nitrate) and reduced (ammonium) N forms in proportions that vary spatially with source and topography. Field evidence of long-term N form effects on seminatural ecosystems and how these are modified by phosphorus and potassium availability are lacking. This study describes cover changes for some key peatland species and litter chemistry from Sphagnum capillifolium, Calluna and Eriophorum vaginatum, and peat in response to 9 years of N treatment. Ammonium and nitrate as NHCl or NaNO were provided to replicate plots in rainwater spray at +8 (low) or +56 (high) kg N ha year, with and without PK via an automated system coupled to site meteorological conditions. Reduced N caused greater N accumulation in all key species than oxidised N, especially at higher doses, but cover declined more, though not significantly so, with oxidised than reduced N at the high N dose. Overall the detrimental effects of high N on Sphagnum and Calluna cover were significant but small. By comparison PK inclusion with 56 kg N ha year as oxidised N, not reduced N, had devastating effects on cover, causing both S. capillifolium and Calluna to decrease 35-fold, facilitating invasion and expansion of nitrophiles, non-characteristic bog plants e.g. Epilobium angustifolium, Epilobium palustre, Juncus effusus, Digitalis purpurea and Dryopteris dilatata. N form appears to be significant for peatlands because of its effects on pH. The significance of changes in plant cover for peat chemistry and decomposition for biogeochemistry is discussed.
1469657|Decomposition of plant material is a complex process that requires interaction among a diversity of microorganisms whose presence and activity is subject to regulation by a wide range of environmental factors. Analysis of extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) provides a way to relate the functional organization of microdecomposer communities to environmental variables. In this study, we examined EEA in relation to litter composition and nitrogen deposition. Mesh bags containing senescent leaves of Quercus borealis (red oak), Acer rubrum (red maple) and Cornus florida (flowering dogwood) were placed on forest floor plots in southeastern New York. One-third of the plots were sprayed monthly with distilled water. The other plots were sprayed monthly with NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> solution at dose rates equivalent to 2 or 8 g N m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>. Mass loss, litter composition, fungal mass, and the activities of eight enzymes were measured on 13 dates for each litter type. Dogwood was followed for one year, maple for two, oak for three. For each litter type and treatment, enzymatic turnover activities were calculated from regressions of LN (%mass remaining) vs. cumulative activity. The decomposition of dogwood litter was more efficient than that of maple and oak. Maple litter had the lowest fungal mass and required the most enzymatic work to decompose, even though its mass loss rate was twice that of oak. Across litter types, N amendment reduced apparent enzymatic efficiencies and shifted EEA away from N acquisition and toward P acquisition, and away from polyphenol oxidation and toward polysaccharide hydrolysis. The effect of these shifts on decomposition rate varied with litter composition: dogwood was stimulated, oak was inhibited and maple showed mixed effects. The results show that relatively small shifts in the activity of one or two critical enzymes can significantly alter decomposition rates.
24715132|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical phase in terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling forming the basis of many ecosystem functions, yet the primary drivers controlling its flux from organic horizons and resultant chemical composition remain only partially understood. We studied dissolved organic matter production and chemistry from organic soil horizons across a 4.1 My old well-constrained chronosequence in Hawaii. Controlled soil column irrigation and leaching experiments were conducted on field moist organic soil horizons to quantify microbial activity, DOM production and chemistry. Both microbial activity (defined as CO production per unit substrate C) and DOM production were found to be lowest in the youngest (0.3 ky) and oldest (4.1 My) sites of the chronosequence, where nutrients (N and P respectively) were most limiting. By contrast, DOM production and microbial activity was greatest at the intermediate-aged (20350 ky) sites where nutrients were least limiting, unrelated to the mass of organic matter found in the organic horizons. While differences in production rates were found, C NMR spectroscopic results indicated that there was a convergence of chemistry from the solid to the dissolved phase at all sites. In particular, all DOM samples were found to have a high proportion of aromatic acids. With supporting data from a diverse range of ecosystems, we postulate that chemical homogenization of DOM relative to source material is a common feature of many ecosystems due to two microbially mediated processes: (1) similar extracellular enzymatic oxidation conferring solubility to a subset of degradation products; and (2) the rapid selective consumption of the more labile organic compounds in the soil solution.
40343550|Calcium/strontium and Sr/Sr ratios in foliage can be used to determine the relative importance of different soil sources of Ca to vegetation, if the discrimination of Ca/Sr by the plant between nutrient sources and foliage is known. We compared these tracers in the foliage of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) to the exchange fraction and acid leaches of soil horizons at six study sites in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA. In a previous study, sugar maple was shown to discriminate for Ca compared to Sr in foliage formation by a factor of 1.14  0.12. After accounting for the predicted 14% shift in Ca/Sr, foliar Ca/Sr and Sr/Sr ratios closely match the values in the Oie horizon at each study site across a 3.6-fold variation in foliar Ca/Sr ratios. Newly weathered cations, for which the Ca/Sr and Sr/Sr ratios are estimated from acid leaches of soils, can be ruled out as a major Ca source to current foliage. Within sites, the Sr/Sr ratio of the soil exchange pool in the Oa horizon and in the 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm increments of the mineral soil are similar to the Oie horizon and sugar maple foliar values, suggesting a common source of Sr in all of the actively cycling pools, but providing no help in distinguishing among them as sources to foliage. The Ca/Sr ratio in the soil exchange pool, however, decreases significantly with depth, and based on this variation, the exchange pool below the forest floor can be excluded as a major Ca source to the current sugar maple foliage. This study confirms that internal recycling of Ca between litter, organic soil horizons and vegetation dominate annual uptake of Ca in northern hardwood ecosystems. Refinement of our understanding of Ca and Sr uptake and allocation in trees allows improvement in the use of Ca/Sr and Sr/Sr ratios to trace Ca sources to plants.
41490498|In the Amazon river system, the source of the large quantity of CO evading from river surfaces remains unidentified. Photochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) is a promising candidate. Few studies in the Amazon river system, and river systems in general, have attempted to quantify the contribution of these specific photoproducts to CO evasion. We conducted photochemical degradation and C addition experiments to measure the rate of production and the impact on bacterial metabolism, respectively, in the black water Rio Negro and in the white water Rio Solimes during low water. We found statistically significant production of both photoproducts in the Rio Negro and none in Rio Solimes. We also found that two photochemically produced LMWOAsacetic and formic acidmay play a significant role in bacterial metabolism in both rivers. Based on our experimental results, we estimate that photochemically produced CO, acetic acid and formic acid alone contribute to only 0.5% of the CO evading from the Rio Negro. Due to our experimental set-up, analytical methods and time of sampling, we caution that our estimate is very conservative. More extensive research is needed before drawing conclusions on the contribution of photochemistry to CO evasion from river surfaces of the Amazon basin.
1469862|Gross and net nitrogen (N) ammonification and nitrification were measured in soils from an uncut and recently cut upland and peatland conifer stand in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Rates of gross total inorganic N immobilization were similar to gross mineralization, resulting in low net mineralization rates in soils from all four upland and peatland conifer stands. Gross ammonification rates were variable but similar in soils from uncut and cut peatland hollows (18-19 mg N kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) and upland forest floor soils (14-19 mg N kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>). Gross ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) immobilization rates were also variable but similar to ammonification rates. Median gross nitrification rates were within 0-2 mg N kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> in soils from all four upland and peatland cut and uncut stands, although rates were consistently higher for the soils from the cut stands. Large variability in gross nitrification rates were observed in peatland soils, however the highest gross nitrification rates were measured in saturated peatland soils. Net rates remained low in the soils from all four stands due to high nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) immobilization and very fast NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> turnover (<0.2 day). Our results suggest that potential NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> losses may be negated by high immobilization in uncut and cut boreal forest stands. This study reveals the potential for the interaction of N production and consumption processes in regulating N retention in upland and peatland conifer forests, and the resilience of the boreal forest to disturbance.
40647928|We modeled the expected range of seasonal and annual NO flux from temperate, grain agroecosystems using Monte Carlo sampling of NO flux field observations. This analysis is complimentary to mechanistic biogeochemical model outcomes and provides an alternative method of estimating NO flux. Our analysis produced a range of annual NO gas flux estimates with mean values overlapping with results from an intermodel comparison of mechanistic models. Mean seasonal NO flux was 1-4% of available N, while median seasonal NO flux was less than 2% of available N across corn, soybean, wheat, ryegrass, legume, and bare fallow systems. The 25th-75th percentile values for simulated average annualized NO flux rates ranged from 1 to 12.2 kg N ha in the conventional system, from 1.3 to 8.8 kg N ha in the cover crop rotation, and from 0.8 to 9.3 kg N ha in the legume rotation. Although these modeling techniques lack the seasonal resolution of mechanistic models, model outcomes are based on measured field observations. Given the large variation in seasonal N gas flux predictions resulting from the application of mechanistic simulation models, this data-derived approach is a complimentary benchmark for assessing the impact of agricultural policy on greenhouse gas emissions.
41490499|Cloud streets are common feature in the Amazon Basin. They form from the combination of the vertical trade wind stress and moist convection. Here, satellite imagery, data collected during the COBRA-PAR (Caxiuan Observations in the Biosphere, River and Atmosphere of Par) field campaign, and high resolution modeling are used to understand the streets' formation and behavior. The observations show that the streets have an aspect ratio of about 3.5 and they reach their maximum activity around 15:00 UTC when the wind shear is weaker, and the convective boundary layer reaches its maximum height. The simulations reveal that the cloud streets onset is caused by the local circulations and convection produced at the interfaces between forest and rivers of the Amazon. The satellite data and modeling show that the large rivers anchor the cloud streets producing a quasi-stationary horizontal pattern. The streets are associated with horizontal roll vortices parallel to the mean flow that organizes the turbulence causing advection of latent heat flux towards the upward branches. The streets have multiple warm plumes that promote a connection between the rolls. These spatial patterns allow fundamental insights on the interpretation of the Amazon exchanges between surface and atmosphere with important consequences for the climate change understanding.
1468671|The biogeochemistry of N in freshwater wetlands is complicated by vegetation characteristics that range from annual herbs to perennial woodlands; by hydrologic characteristics that range from closed, precipitation-driven to tidal, riverine wetlands; and by the diversity of the nitrogen cycle itself. It is clear that sediments are the single largest pool of nitrogen in wetland ecosystems (100's to 1000's g N m<sup>-2</sup>) followed in rough order-of-magnitude decreases by plants and available inorganic nitrogen. Precipitation inputs <latex>$(<1-2\ \text{g N m}^{-2}\ \text{yr}^{-1})$</latex> are well known but other atmospheric inputs, e.g. dry deposition, are essentially unknown and could be as large or larger than wet deposition. Nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) is an important supplementary input in some wetlands <latex>$(<<1-3\ \text{g N m}^{-2}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$</latex> but is probably limited by the excess of fixed nitrogen usually present in wetland sediments. Plant uptake normally ranges from a few g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> to  35 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> with extreme values of up to  100 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Results of translocation experiments done to date may be misleading and may call for a reassessment of the magnitude of both plant uptake and leaching rates. Interactions between plant litter and decomposer microorganisms tend, over the short-term, to conserve nitrogen within the system in immobile forms. Later, decomposers release this nitrogen in forms and at rates that plants can efficiently reassimilate. The NO<sub>3</sub> formed by nitrification (< 0.1 to 10 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) has several fates which may tend to either conserve nitrogen (uptake and dissimilatory reduction to ammonium) or lead to its loss (denitrification). Both nitrification and denitrification operate at rates far below their potential and under proper conditions (e.g. draining or fluctuating water levels) may accelerate. However, virtually all estimates of denitrification rates in freshwater wetlands are based on measurements of potential denitrification, not actual denitrification and, as a consequence, the importance of denitrification in these ecosystems may have been greatly over estimated. In general, larger amounts of nitrogen cycle within freshwater wetlands than flow in or out. Except for closed, ombrotrophic systems this might seem an unusual characteristic for ecosystems that are dominated by the flux of water, however, two factors limit the opportunity for N loss. At any given time the fraction of nitrogen in wetlands that could be lost by hydrologic export is probably a small fraction of the potentially mineralizable nitrogen and is certainly a negligible fraction of the total nitrogen in the system. Second, in some cases freshwater wetlands may be hydrologically isolated so that the bulk of upland water flow may pass under (in the case of floating mats) or by (in the case of riparian systems) the biotically active components of the wetland. This may explain the rather limited range of N loading rates real wetlands can accept in comparison to, for example, percolation columns or engineered marshes.
24716791|An estimated 215,000 tonnes of mercury (Hg) have been emitted to the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources since the nineteenth century, igniting widespread environmental monitoring owing to its toxicity. The environmental fate of Hg is strongly determined by catchment characteristics, especially soil organic matter. In this study, concentrations and pools of Hg were determined for lakes and soils in upland peat-dominated catchments in Ireland to assess controls of aquatic Hg and soil response to changes in emissions. Headwater lakes in upland coastal regions were surveyed for water chemistry and total Hg (THg) during spring 2008. In addition, a sub-set of lakes (n = 5) were repeatedly sampled during 20092011, and their surface soils collected for Hg analysis, including a short (30 cm) peat core to assess temporal Hg fluxes using radiometric Pb dating. Peat cores indicated a significant decrease in Hg deposition since the 1980s, in broad agreement with other 'background' regions. Total Hg was correlated with total organic carbon (TOC) in the survey and intensive study lakes (r = 0.70 and 0.45), indicative of the strong affinity of Hg to organic matter. At the intensive lakes, monomethylmercury (MMHg) made up 3.3 % of mean THg and exhibited a positive correlation with total SO (r = 0.55). Further, both THg and MMHg were significantly correlated with conductivity (r = 0.48 and 0.54, respectively) potentially owing to marine inputs, and negatively correlated with pH (r = 0.59 and 0.56 respectively). Significant differences in THg (and MMHg) were observed between the five lakes, the highest concentrations (4.45 and 0.16 ng L, respectively) tended to be associated with TOC in lakes and occurred at sites in the northwest, characterized by higher levels of soil organic matter (peat) and soil moisture relative to the other sites. In contrast, surface soil pools of THg ranged between 13.6 and 20.8 g m across study sites and did not vary significantly, but were typical of global background regions. Nonetheless, the organic rich soils that dominate Ireland are a natural sink for THg, and peat harvesting for energy production may release long-term stores of Hg from deeper soil layers.
1469078|Solute concentrations in atmospheric deposition and stream water were measured in two mixed-conifer catchments (Tharp's and Log creeks) in the Sierra Nevada of California from 1984 through 1995, a period including a 6-year drought and a prescribed burn in one catchment. The effects of prescribed burning in the Tharp's Creek catchment significantly increased the concentrations of most solutes in stream water. In the first year after prescribed burning, the VWM (volume-weighted mean) concentrations of acid anions in stream water increased proportionally more than those of the base cations, and ANC (acid neutralizing capacity) more than doubled. Sulfate and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> increased proportionally more in stream water than any other ions after the fire, but pre- and post-burn VWM pH were not significantly different. VWM SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations the first year after burning occurred were about 16- and 2,000-fold above pre-burn baselines, respectively, while that of Cl<sup>-</sup> increased 4-fold. Net retention (precipitation inputs minus streamwater outputs) of H<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> occurred in both catchments, except after prescribed burning of the Tharp's Creek catchment in the fall of 1990, which caused a net export of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> the first year after the burn. Most solutes remained above pre-disturbance concentrations by the end of the third year after burning, whereas H<sup>+</sup> and SiO<sub>2</sub> remained below. Periodic increases in the concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and decreases in ANC and SiO<sub>2</sub> occurred during a 6-year drought monitored in the adjacent undisturbed catchment of Log Creek.
1469455|Nitrate immobilization into organic matter is thought to require catalysis by the enzymes of soil microorganisms. However, recent studies suggest that nitrate added to soil is immobilized rapidly and this process may include abiotic pathways. We amended living and sterilized soil with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled nitrate and nitrite to investigate biotic and abiotic immobilization. We report rapid transformation of nitrate in incubations of the O layer of forest soils that have been sterilized to prevent microbial activity and to denature microbial enzymes. Approximately 30, 40, and 60% of the <sup>15</sup>N-labeled nitrate added to live, irradiated, or autoclaved organic horizon soil disappeared from the extractable inorganic-N pool in less than 15 minutes. About 5% or less of the nitrate was recovered as insoluble organic N in live and sterilized soil, and the remainder was determined to be soluble organic N. Added <sup>15</sup>N-nitrite, however, was either lost to gaseous N or incorporated into an insoluble organic N form in both live and sterile organic soils. Hence, the fate and pathway of apparent abiotic nitrate immobilization differs from the better-known mechanisms of nitrite reactions with soil organic matter. Nitrate and nitrite added to live A-horizon soil was largely recovered in the form added, suggesting that rapid conversion of nitrate to soluble organic-N may be limited to C-rich organic horizons. The processes by which this temperate forest soil transforms added nitrate to soluble organic-N cannot be explained by established mechanisms, but appears to be due to abiotic processes in the organic horizon.
23359763|We measured CO 2 concentration and determined evasion rate and piston velocity across the waterair interface in flow-through chambers at eight stations along two 20 km long streams in agricultural landscapes in Zealand, Denmark. Both streams were 918-fold supersaturated in CO 2 with daily means of 240 and 340 M in JanuaryMarch and 130 and 180 M in JuneAugust. Annual CO 2 medians were 212 M in six other streams and 460 M in four groundwater wells, while seven lakes were weakly supersaturated (29 M). Air concentrations immediately above stream surfaces were close to mean atmospheric conditions except during calm summer nights. Piston velocity from 0.4 to 21.6 cm h -1 was closely related to current velocity permitting calculation of evasion rates for entire streams. CO 2 evasion rates were highest in midstream reaches (1701,200 mmol m -2 day -1 ) where CO 2 -rich soil water entered fast stream flow, while rates were tenfold lower (25100 mmol m -2 day -1 ) in slow-flowing lower reaches. CO 2 evasion mainly derived from the input of CO 2 in soil water. The variability of CO 2 evasion along the two lowland streams covered much of the range in sub-Arctic and temperate streams reported previously. In budgets for the two stream catchments, loss of carbon from soils via the hydrological cycle was substantial (3.25.7 mmol m -2 day -1 ) and dominated by CO 2 consumed to form HCO 3 - by mineral dissolution (6976%) and export of organic carbon (1523%) relative to dissolved CO 2 export (7-9%).
40647959|To clarify responses of plant and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools in grassland ecosystem to N addition, a field experiment was performed in a grassland in Keerqin Sandy Lands, Northeast China. We investigated vegetation composition and and N pools of plant and soil (0-30 cm) after five consecutive years of N addition at a rate of 20 g N m y . Vegetation composition and species diversity responded dramatically to N addition, as dominance by C perennials was replaced with C annuals. Carbon in aboveground pool increased significantly (over two-fold), mainly due to the increase of the in aboveground living plants and surface litter, which increased by 98 and 134%, respectively. Although soil did not change significantly, the root pool decreased in response to 5 years of N addition. The total ecosystem pool was not significantly impacted by N addition because the large soil pool did not respond to N addition, and the increase in aboveground was offset by the decrease in root pool. Moreover, N addition significantly increased the aboveground N pool, but had no significant effects on belowground and total ecosystem N pools. Our results suggest that in the mid-term N addition alters the and N partitioning in above-and belowground pools, but has no significant effects on total ecosystem and N pools in these N-limited grasslands.
41490482|Headwater streams have a demonstrated ability to denitrify a portion of their nitrate (NO) load but there has not been an extensive consideration of where in a stream this process is occurring and how various habitats contribute to total denitrification capability. As part of the Lotie Intersite Nitrogen Experiment II (LINX II) we measured denitrification potential in 65 streams spanning eight regions of the US and draining three land-use types. In each stream, potential denitrification rates were measured in common substrate types found across many streams as well as locations unique to particular streams. Overall, habitats from streams draining urban and agricultural land-uses showed higher potential rates of denitrification than reference streams draining native vegetation. This difference among streams was probably driven by higher ambient nitrate concentrations found in urban or agricultural streams. Within streams, sandy habitats and accumulations of fine benthic organic matter contributed more than half of the total denitrification capacity (mg N removed m h). A particular rate of potential denitrification per unit area could be achieved either by high activity per unit organic matter or lower activities associated with larger standing stocks of organic matter. We found that both small patches with high rates (hot spots) or more widespread but less active areas (cool matrix) contributed significantly to whole stream denitrification capacity. Denitrification estimated from scaled-up denitrification enzyme assay (DEA) potentials were not always dramatically higher than in situ rates of denitrification measured as N gas generation following 24-h N-NO tracer additions. In general, headwater streams draining varying land-use types have significant potential to remove nitrate via denitrification and some appear to be functioning near their maximal capacity.
1469290|Peat soils with high nitrogen content are potential sources of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). Fluxes of nitrous oxide were measured in situ on nine virgin and ten drained peatlands of different hydrology and nutrient status. Numbers of nitrifying bacteria were estimated in different layers of the peat profiles with a most-probable-number technique. Nitrification potentials were determined in soil slurries of pH 4 and 6 from the profiles of six peat soils. Many virgin peatlands showed low N<sub>2</sub>O uptake. Lowering of the water table generally increased the average fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O from the soils, although more in minerotrophic (nutrient rich) than in ombrotrophic (nutrient poor) sites. Ammonium oxidizing bacteria were found on only two sites but nitrite oxidizers were detected in almost all peat profiles. More nitrite oxidizers were found in drained than in virgin peat profiles. Nitrification was enhanced after lowering of the water table in minerotrophic peat but not in ombrotrophic peat. The N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes correlated positively with the numbers of nitrite oxidizers, nitrification potential, N, P and Ca content and pH of the soil and negatively with the level of water table (expressed as negative values) and K content of the soil.
1468574|The biological activity and the amount of living fungal mycelium in the mor humus of pine forests around an industrialized city were studied. The activities were lower in the more polluted zone than in a cleaner one but varied between sites within the zones. The relationship of these activities to the microbial environment was determined in both the total data and in the various zones separately. Soil respiration rate was positively related to ammonium nitrogen concentration of the humus in the less polluted zone but negatively in the more polluted zone, while it related negatively to total nitrogen concentration of the humus in the entire data set. DHA was partly accounted for by the variation in acidity parameters, and best by pH(CaCl<sub>2</sub>), with a positive relation. The length of FDA active fungal mycelium showed no significant variation between the zones or sites, and was thus poorly explained by the environmental variables. The weather conditions prevailing at two seasons did not explain any variation of the activities or the length of FDA mycelium, though the biological variables were in general positively related to the moisture of the humus.
1468580| Biochemical weathering mechanisms carried out by Penicillium frequentans and Cladosporium cladosporoides on unaltered sandstone, granite and limestone were studied using FTIR, X-ray diffraction, atomic absorption and flame photometry. Strains belonging to both fungal species, isolated from the faades of two Spanish Cathedrals, were used. Large amounts of oxalic, citric and gluconic acids were produced by P. frequentans in broth cultures. These metabolites caused extensive deterioration of clay silicates, micas and feldspars from both sandstone and granite and also of calcite and dolomite from limestone, as a result of high cation release and organic salts formation such as calcium, magnesium and ferric oxalates and calcium citrates. Comparatively, the biodegradative effect brought about by C. cladosporoides was much less than that caused by P. frequentans. Neither organic acids nor organic salts were formed by C. cladosporiodes samples. It is concluded that filamentous fungi are able to cause an extensive weathering of stone, due principally to organic acid excretion, although other metabolites participate to a lesser extent in these deteriorative processes. Ecological adaptative mechanisms, such micronutrients uptake and trivalent cations chelation (Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup>) are derived from fungal growth on stone monuments. 
4151467|Nitrogen addition may alter the decomposition rate for different organic-matter pools in contrasting ways. Using a paired-plot design, we sought to determine the effects of long-term elevated N on the stability of five organic-matter pools: organic horizons (Oe + a), whole mineral soil (WS), mineral soil fractions including the light fraction (LF), heavy fraction (HF), and a physically recombined fraction (RF). These substrates were incubated for 300 days, and respiration, mineralized N, and active microbial biomass were measured. Samples with elevated N gave 15% lower cumulative respiration for all five substrates. Over the 300-day incubation, the Oe + a gave twice the cumulative respiration (
1469437|The extracellular secretions of epipelic diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are an important source of carbohydrates on intertidal sediments. For analytical purposes, sediment carbohydrates have been operationally separated into colloidal and bulk fractions that are often assumed to be similar in their chemical properties. However, there has been little investigation into the nature of the two fractions. In this study, carbohydrate fractions were sampled in situ, isolated, purified and biochemically characterised using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Both carbohydrate fractions were found to contain similar sugars although in different proportions. Glucose represented more than 80% of the monosaccharides identified in the colloidal carbohydrate fraction while only 37% of monosaccharides present in the bulk carbohydrate fraction. Colloidal carbohydrate concentrations showed short-term variability and were correlated with diatom biomass (as chlorophyll a) suggesting the colloidal fraction is labile and may be of recent origin, perhaps representing diatom activity. Concentrations of the bulk carbohydrate fraction did not show significant short-term variation and was therefore more refractory. This combination of biochemical and field data suggested that the bulk and colloidal carbohydrate fractions were chemically and physically different. These findings have relevance to studies of estuarine carbon cycling.
20055235|The effects of land-cover change on soil properties have reached regional proportions in the southwestern Amazon, and can be detected in their patterns at the scale of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. Spatial analysis of an extensive soil profile database revealed four nested spatial scales at which different patterns in soil properties occur: &lt3, &lt10, &lt68, and &gt68 km. The shortest scales account for the majority of the spatial variability in the biogeochemically important properties (phosphorus, nitrogen, organic carbon), while the longest scales explain the most for pedologic properties (pH, aluminum, percent clay and sand). The magnitude and sign of correlations among soil properties changed with scale, indicating major shifts in distribution and soil dynamics depending on the scale of observation and analysis. Precipitation, substrate composition, topography, and biological influences vary over large areas, leading to variable distribution of soil properties, and complicating the evaluation of the effect of deforestation on biogeochemical cycling. We modeled the relationships among scale-specific patterns in soil properties and the soil forming state factors to tease out the relative impact of changing land cover. Soil property short-scale variability corresponded with the distribution of land cover and terrain attributes, medium scale variation with geology and state soil map classifications, and long scale with geology and precipitation. The strength of these relationships may be partially attributable to the resolution of the maps used as proxies for the soil forming factors. Land-cover change has already left a discernable imprint on broad-scale soil nutrient patterns, although it is still not the dominant process.
1469266| During the fall of 1989 7.7Mg/ha of calcium carbonate was applied on two tributary catchments (40 ha and 60 ha) to Woods Lake, a small (25 ha) acidic headwater lake in the western Adirondack region of New York. Stream-water chemistry in both catchment tributaries responded immediately. Acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) increased by more than 200 eq/L in one of the streams and more than 1000 eq/L in the other, from pre-liming values which ranged from -25 to +40 eq/L. The increase in ANC was primarily due to increases in dissolved Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Most of the initial response of the streams was due to the dissolution of calcite that fell directly into the stream channels and adjacent wetlands. A small beaver impoundment and associated wetlands were probably responsible for the greater response observed in one of the streams. After the liming of subcatchment IV (60 ha), Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations increased with increasing stream discharge in the stream during fall rain events, suggesting a contribution from calcite dissolved within the soil and transported to the stream by surface runoff or shallow interflow. Concentrations of other ions not associated with the calcite (e.g. Na<sup>+</sup>) decreased during fall rain events, presumably due to mixing of solute-rich base flow with more dilute shallow interflow. The strong relation between changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and changes in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations during spring snowmelt, (r<sup>2</sup>=0.93, slope = 0.96, on an equivalent basis) suggests that both solutes had a common source in the organic horizon of the soil. Increases in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations during snowmelt were balanced by increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> that was released either directly from the calcite or from exchange sites, mitigating episodic acidification of the stream. However, high ambient NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations and relatively low ambient Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the stream during the spring caused the stream to become acidic despite the CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment. In stream WO2 (40ha), Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were much higher than in stream WO4 because of the dissolution of calcite which fell directly into the upstream beaver pond and its associated wetlands. Calcium concentrations decreased as both NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations and stream discharge increased, due to the dilution of Ca-enriched beaver pond water by shallow interflow. Despite this dilution, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were high enough to more than balance strong acid anion (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>) concentrations, resulting in a positive ANC in this stream throughout the year. These data indicate that liming of wetlands and beaver ponds is more effective than whole catchment liming in neutralizing acidic surface waters. 
41410560|The Red River Delta (RRD) (Vietnam), a region experiencing rapid population growth, industrialization, and economic development, concentrates 54% of the population of the whole Red River watershed in less than 10% of the basin area. Our study aimed at understanding and quantifying the processes by which the delta affects the nutrient fluxes coming from the upstream watershed before they reach the sea. A comprehensive budget of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silica (Si) fluxes associated with natural and anthropogenic processes in the terrestrial and hydrological system of the delta was established for five sub-basins of the delta for the period 2000-2006, based on official statistical data, available measurements, and our own sampling campaigns and enquiries. The results show that anthropogenic inputs of N and P brought into the delta area are higher than the amounts delivered by the river from the upstream watershed. However, the amounts of these two elements ultimately delivered to the coastal zone from the delta are lower than the amounts carried by the upstream river, showing extremely efficient retention of both the soils and the delta's drainage network. For Si (taking into account both dissolved and amorphous solid forms), the retention is much lower. High retention of N and P and low retention of Si in the delta area have up to now protected the coastal zone from severe eutrophication problems. for five sub-basins of the delta for the period 2000-2006, based on official statistical data, available measurements, and our own sampling campaigns and enquiries.

23359756|The carbon pool of peatlands has been considered as potentially unstable in a changing climate. This study is the first presenting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) net ecosystem exchange, CO 2 efflux due to ecosystem respiration and CO 2 uptake by gross primary production over a complete growing season for different microforms of a boreal peatland in Russia (6156N,5013E). CO 2 fluxes were measured using the closed chamber technique from the 25th April in the period of snow melt until the end of the vegetation period and the first frost on the 20th October 2008 at seven different microform types: minerogenous and ombrogenous hollows, lawns and hummocks, respectively, and Carex lawns situated in a transition zone between minerogenous and ombrogenous mire parts. The total number of chamber flux measurements was 5,517. Ombrogenous hummocks and lawns were sources of CO 2 over the investigation period whereas hollows and minerogenous lawns were CO 2 sinks. Some plots of Carex lawns and minerogenous hummocks were sinks while other plots of these microform types were sources. The CO 2 fluxes were characterised by large variability not only between the microform types but also within the respective microform types. Of all microform types, the Carex, ombrogenous, and minerogenous lawns showed the highest variability in CO 2 fluxes, which is probably related to a stronger within-microform heterogeneity in vegetation composition and coverage as well as in the water table level. Air temperature was one of the dominant controls on the CO 2 flux dynamics. Water table and green area index were found to have strong influence on CO 2 fluxes both within different patches of the same microform type as well as between different microforms.
1469129| Possible interactions between soil enzymes and the biogeochemistry of wetlands were investigated during a field-based drought simulation. Under control (waterlogged) conditions, correlations were found between the activity of the enzyme -glucosidase and two properties associated with carbon cycling, namely i) CH<sub>4</sub> release (r = 0.79, p < 0.01) and ii) dissolved organic carbon concentration (r = -0.81, p < 0.01). In contrast, the transition to drought conditions resulted in correlations between -glucosidase activity and certain mineralisation processes, namely the release of mg and Ca (r = 0.72, p < 0.05). Sulphatase activity correlated with changes in sulphate concentration during the drought simulation (r = 0.73, p < 0.05). Further support for the suggested enzymic involvement in biogeochemical processes was found in laboratory studies. These experiments indicated that increasing the abundance of -glucosidase could stimulate trace gas emissions (p < 0.001) and increase the concentration of magnesium and calcium (p < 0.05). Increased sulphatase abundance caused a suppression of methane emissions (p = 0.053). 
1469454| Although studies have shown that peatland drainage and harvesting alter local hydrology, microclimate, and peat characteristics, little is known about the effects of these changes on CO<sub>2</sub> production rates. This study examines the different factors affecting CO<sub>2</sub> production from natural and cutover peatlands. Laboratory peat incubations were performed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions to determine the influence of temperature, soil moisture, and peat depth on CO<sub>2</sub> production rates from peat samples taken from: (1) a natural peatland; (2) a 2-year post-cutover peatland and; (3) a 7-year post-cutover peatland. CO<sub>2</sub> production rates ranged from 0.21 to 4.87 mol g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> under anaerobic conditions, and from 0.37 to 15.69 mol g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in the aerobic trials. While no significant differences were found between the CO<sub>2</sub> production rates of the two cutover sites, the natural site consistently displayed higher production values. The natural site was also the only site to exhibit strong depth dependent trends, thus indicating the importance of the upper peat layer with respect to substrate quality. Higher production rates were found under aerobic than anaerobic conditions, with the greatest response to oxygen observed at the natural site. Production rates increased with both temperature and soil moisture, with maximum production rates found at 20 C and 92% moisture content. Temperature responses were generally greater at the cutover sites, while soil moisture had greater effects on the natural site peat. Results of this work agree with previous studies that suggest that it is essential to begin restoration once a cutover peatland is abandoned. Re-wetting a cutover peatland (through restoration practices) is necessary to prevent an increase in peat temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> production since cutover peat has higher Q<sub>10</sub> values than natural peat. A decrease in overall peatland oxidation should reduce the persistent source of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from cutover peatlands and the irreversible changes in peat structure that impede Sphagnum re-establishment. 
20456423|Hydrologic pathways through soil affect element leaching by determining the relative importance of biogeochemical processes such as sorption and decomposition. We used stable hydrogen isotopes of water (D) to examine the influence of flowpaths on soil solution chemistry in a mature spruce--hemlock forest in coastal Oregon, USA. Soil solutions (50 cm depth, n = 13) were collected monthly for 1 year and analyzed for D, major ions and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON). We propose that the variability of D can be used as an index of flowpath length and contact time. Throughfall variability in D was much greater than soil solution variability, illustrating that soil solution integrates the variation in inputs. Lysimeters with greater variation in D presumably have a greater proportion of flow through rapid flowpaths such as macropores. The variation in soil solution D for individual lysimeters explained up to 53% of the variation in soil solution chemistry, and suggests that flowpaths influence leaching of some constituents. Soil solutions from lysimeters with greater D variation had higher DOC and DON (R = 0.51 and 0.37, respectively), perhaps because transport via macropores reduces inter-action of DOM with the soil matrix. In contrast, nitrate concentrations were highest in lysimeters with a small variation in D, where long contact time and low DOC concentrations may yield higher net nitrification. Our results demonstrate the utility of stable isotopes to link flowpaths and soil solution chemistry, and illustrate how the spatial complexity of soils can influence ecosystem-level nutrient losses.
1468943|Large earthen-walled lysimeters at the San Dimas Experimental Forest in southern California present a unique opportunity to assess vegetation effects on biogeochemical processes and cation release by weathering in controlled soil-vegetation systems where archived samples of soil parent material are available for comparison. The lysimeters were filled in 1937 with homogenized fine sandy loam derived on site from the weathering of diorite, and planted in 1946 with scrub oak (Quercus dumosa) and Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri). Changes in base cation contents were measured in above-ground biomass, and total and exchangeable soil pools to a depth of 1 meter. All cations in the non-exchangeable soil pool decreased relative to the initial fill material, indicating release by weathering. Sodium and K were depleted from both exchangeable and non-exchangeable pools of the soils. Plant uptake of Na was minimal, whereas K storage in vegetation exceeded the loss from the exchangeable soil pool. In both soil-vegetation systems, but especially for oak, there was an increase in exchangeable Ca and Mg. For all base cations, storage in above-ground biomass was greater for oak, whereas losses by weathering from the non-exchangeable soil pool were greater under pine. Strong evidence supports biocycling as a controlling mechanism resulting in greater Ca and Mg release by weathering under pine. In addition, decreases in non-exchangeable Ca and Mg were strongly correlated to decrease in Si under oak, whereas no correlation was observed under pine. We conclude that weathering reactions or stoichiometry differed between vegetation types.
1468664|The chemistry and nutrient inputs of wet deposition, and the N chemistry of throughfall, were characterized for a tallgrass prairie in north-central Kansas. Dominant ions in wetfall were NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>; weighted mean pH was 4.79. Principal sources of ions appeared to be natural emissions and wind-blown soils. Concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, and organic N in wet deposition were 0.31, 0.30, and 0.17 mg/L, respectively, resulting in N inputs of 2.5, 2.5, and 1.4 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Comparisons with bulk precipitation suggested that at least 50% of atmospheric N inputs were from dry deposition. Concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, and organic N in unburned prairie throughfall were 0.27, 0.28, and 1.28 mg/L, and in burned prairie throughfall were 0.33, 0.37, and 0.91 mg/L, respectively. The prairie canopy intercepted up to 48% of incident precipitation. Lower inorganic N and higher organic N concentrations in throughfall relative to wet deposition probably resulted from leaf uptake of N and immobilization by microbes associated with the standing dead plant materials of the prairie canopy. The removal of these materials by fire is important in maintaining N availability for tallgrass prairie. Much of the N immobilization appeared to have been of N that was supplied to the prairie canopy by dry deposition.
41490492|Plant productivity in many tropical savannas is phosphorus limited. The biogeochemical cycling of P in these ecosystems, however, has not been well quantified. In the present study, we characterized P stocks and fluxes in a well-preserved small watershed in the Brazilian Cerrado. As the Cerrado is also a firedominated ecosystem, we measured the P stocks and fluxes in a cerrado stricto sensu plot with complete exclusion of fire for 26 years (unburned plot) and then tested some predictions about the impacts of fire impacts on P cycling in an experimental plot that was burned three times since 1992 (burned plot). The unburned area is an ecosystem with large soil stocks of total P (1,151 kg ha up to 50 cm depth), but the largest fraction is in an occluded form. Readily extractable P was found up to 3 m soil depth suggesting that deep soil is more important to the P cycle than has been recognized. The P stock in belowground biomass (0-800 cm) was 9.9 kg ha. Decomposition of fine litter released 0.97 kg P ha year. Fluxes of P through bulk atmospheric deposition, throughfall and litter leachate were very low (0.008, 0.006 and 0.028 kg ha year, respectively) as was stream export (0.001 kg ha year). Immobilization of P by microbes during the rainy season seems to be an important mechanism of P conservation in this ecosystem. Fire significantly increased P flux in litter leachate to 0.11 kg ha year , and added 1.2 kg ha of P in ash deposition after fire. We found an increase of P concentration in soil solution at 100 cm depth (from 0.03 g 1 in unburned plot to 0.3 g 1 in the burned plot). In surface soils (0-10 cm) of the burned plot, fire decreased the concentrations of extractable organic-P fractions, but did not significantly increase inorganic-P fractions. The reduction of extractable soil organic P in the burned plot in topsoil and the increase of P in the soil solution at greater depths indicated a reduction of P availability and may increase P fixation in deep soils. Repeated fire events over the long term may result in significant net loss of available forms of phosphorus from this ecosystem.
1469823|The transformation of native Cerrado into Pinus caribaea Morelet plantations changes the DOM dynamics including changed rates of mineralisation, denitrification, and C export to the groundwater. To examine the differences in quantity, temporal dynamics, and quality of DOM between Cerrado and Pine plantations we collected rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, litter leachate (under pine only) and soil solution at 15, 80, and 200 cm depth in weekly intervals during the rainy seasons 1997/98 and 1998/99. We determined total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and assessed DOM quality by separating hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions and by NMR analysis of organic layer extracts. The rainfall had a mean DOC concentration of 2.6 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. The mean concentrations of DOC in the throughfall of the pine plantations (5.0-10.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) were significantly above those of Cerrado (2.6-4.9 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). During the first part of the rainy seasons (October-December), the concentrations of DOC in the soil solution (15-200 cm depth) under Cerrado and pine did not differ significantly. During the second part of both rainy seasons (January-April), the concentrations of DOC in the soil solution under Cerrado (4.4-5.1 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) exceeded those under PI (1.4-2.7 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). Possible explanations of the latter include higher DOM input into the Cerrado soil and a stronger retention and/or faster mineralisation of the pine DOM than of the Cerrado DOM in the mineral soil. As the structural composition of DOM extracted from the organic layer under Cerrado and pine did not differ significantly, faster mineralisation was the most likely explanation for partly lower DOC concentrations in the soil solution under pine than under Cerrado. This assumption was supported by increasing contributions of hydrophobic DOM to total DOM with increasing depth under pine while, under Cerrado, the DOM composition did not change with depth. The reason for DOM mineralisation under pine was probably the higher N availability because total N concentrations were 11-23 times higher under pine than under Cerrado.
4151464|A major part of the dissolved organic matter produced in the organic layers of forest ecosystems and leached into the mineral soil is retained by the upper subsoil horizons. The retention is selective and thus dissolved organic matter in the subsoils has different composition than dissolved organic matter leached from the forest floor. Here we report on changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter with soil depth based on C-to-N ratios, XAD-8 fractionation, wet-chemical analyses (lignin-derived CuO oxidation products, hydrolysable sugars and amino sugars) and liquid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Dissolved organic matter was sampled directly beneath the forest floor using tension-free lysimeters and at 90 cm depth by suction cups in Haplic Arenosols under Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Rendzic Leptosols under European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest. At both sites, the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased but not as strongly as reported for deeply weathered soils. The decrease in DOC was accompanied by strong changes in the composition of dissolved organic matter. The proportion of the XAD-8- adsorbable (hydrophobic) fraction, carboxyl and aromatic C, and the concentrations of lignin-derived phenols decreased whereas the concentrations of sugars, amino sugars, and nitrogen remained either constant or increased. A general feature of the compositional changes within the tested compound classes was that the ratios of neutral to acidic compounds increased with depth. These results indicate that during the transport of dissolved organic matter through the soils, oxidatively degraded lignin-derived compounds were preferentially retained while potentially labile material high in nitrogen and carbohydrates tended to remain dissolved. Despite the studied soils' small capacity to sorb organic matter, the preferential retention of potentially refractory and acidic compounds suggests sorption by the mineral soil matrix rather than biodegradation to govern the retention of dissolved organic matter even in soils with a low sorption capacity.
1468543| Concentrations of dissolved silicate and particulate biogenic silicate were measured in three branches of the lower river Rhine in The Netherlands in order to analyse the role of this element in the eutrophication of the river basin. Particulate silicate followed the seasonal development of the phytoplankton, which was dominated by diatoms. The concentration of dissolved silicate fell during blooms (<0.1 mg.l<sup>-1</sup>), but the amounts of biogenic silicate measured ( 1 mg.l<sup>-1</sup>) were insufficient to explain the seasonal decrease in the dissolved fraction; this indicates retention of silicate upstream. Some particulate biogenic silicate in river water settled in man-made sedimentation areas in the Rhine delta. The observations suggest that changes in silicate fixation in the Rhine may have contributed to the incidence of non-diatom phytoplankton blooms in receiving waters. 
20519861|Organic carbon degradation experiments were carried out using flow-through reactors with sediments collected from an intertidal freshwater marsh of an eutrophic estuary (The Scheldt, Belgium). Concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon, methane, dissolved cations (Ca, Mg, Na and K), total dissolved Fe, phosphate and alkalinity were measured in the outflow solutions from reactors that were supplied with or without the terminal electron acceptor nitrate. Organic carbon mineralization rates were computed from the release rates of DIC after correcting for the contribution of carbonate mineral dissolution. The experiments ran for several months until nitrate reducing activity could no longer be detected. In the reactors supplied with nitrate, 10-13% of the bulk sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) was mineralized by the end of the experiments. In reactors receiving no nitrate, only 3-9% of the initial SOC was mineralized. Organic matter utilization by nitrate reducers could be described as the simultaneous degradation of two carbon pools with different maximum oxidation rates and half-saturation constants. Even when nitrate was supplied in non-limiting concentrations about half of the carbon mineralization in the reactors was due to fermentative processes, rather than being coupled to nitrate respiration. Fermentation may thus be responsible for a large fraction of the DIC efflux from organic-rich, nearshore sediments.
41490525|The seasonal pattern and primary mechanism of nitrogen (N) export by surface runoff from the Wuchuan subwatershed (WCW), an agricultural upper watershed (1.88 km) located in southcast China, were investigated based on extensive streamwater measurements in 20042005 under subtropical climatic conditions. The results disclosed a highly variable but strong linkage between hydrological and anthropogenic controls and N export. N export via surface runoff presented a significant seasonal pattern caused by changes in rainfall and watershed N input. Approximately 75% of the annual N export (67 kg ha) was flushed by those storm runoff mainly occurred during the wet season (March through September). The WCW dataset of N concentrations and loads during both baseflow and stormflow implied an interactive effects of anthropogenetic N input and hydrology conditions: N export was flush-driven in late spring, summer and autumn (wet season), but highly related with soil N in winter and early spring. Compared to undisturbed watersheds under similar rainfall conditions, WCW exported a considerable amount of N due to intensive fertilizer application (a mean of 690 kg N ha year, commonly as surface applications). This work provides a first characterization of a small agricultural Chinese catchment under subtropical climates and its associated N export behavior.
1468758| Cores from five lakes of the Adirondack Mountains, New York, were analyzed for sedimentary sulfur concentrations and stable sulfur isotopic compositions. Isotopic values of total sedimentary sulfur were as much as 6 to 8 lower than isotopic values of sulfur sources (soils, tree leaves and lake water sulfate) which showed little isotopic variation in the Adirondacks. The low isotopic values of recent sediments indicate increased sulfate reduction, probably in response to increased sulfate loading and acid deposition. Detailed historical reconstruction of sulfate loading histories from sedimentary sulfur profiles is premature, however, since model calculations indicate that sulfur can be added to deeper older sediments by ongoing, contemporary sulfate reduction. 
1469128| The research was carried out to ascertain the effect of rimsulfuron, a solfonylurea herbrcide, on soil microbial biomass growth and activity. Laboratory experiments were performed in a silty clay loam soil to relate changes of soil microbial biomass-C content and global hydrolytic activity to the rimsulfuron persistence under different conditions of temperature and soil humidity. The results showed that rimsulfuron persistence depended significantly on temperature, while it remained almost unchanged by humidity changes. A range of half-life values form 3.5 to 14.8 days was found in a temperature range from 10 C to 25 C, with lower half-lives at higher temperature. Persistence data were processed with the VARLEACH model, in order to predict rimsulfuron persistence under different environmental conditions. On comparing treated soils with untreated soil samples, decreases in the microbial biomass-C content and increases in the global hydrolytic activity were found to be connected with rimsulfuron persistence at the various experimental conditions. These effects persisted for a short time and, they were evident earlier at higher temperature and more persistent at lower humidity. This behaviour is discussed in terms of rimsulfuron toxicity, with the consequent release of endocellular hydrolytic enzymes from the dead microorganisms. An equation was derived to calculate the microbial biomass-C content in response to the variation of rimsulfuron persistence. 
1468706|The concentrations and transport of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were studied in the Apure River, Venezuela, over a period of 21 months. The drainage basin, which is in western Venezuela, encompasses 167,000 km<sup>2</sup>, most of which has low relief and supports tropical savanna vegetation. Average runoff for the period of study was 361 mm/year. Discharge-weighted mean concentrations were 188 ug/l for total P, 957 ug/l for total N, and 9.8 mg/l for organic C. Annual transport was 0.68 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> for total P, 3.45 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> for total N, and 35.4 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> for organic C. Particulate matter accounted for 68% of P, 54% of N, and 37% of C transport. The yield of carbon from the Apure watershed agrees well with empirical predictions, based mostly on the temperate zone, for watersheds of similar size and water yield. Seasonal patterns in chemistry are tied strongly to the hydrologic cycle. When the wet season begins, rising water flushes organic matter from side channels and produces a sharp increase in particulate C and N. Particulate P, which is associated more with mineral material, also increases during rising water. All dissolved constituents except inorganic C also increase over the rising-water phase. As the river inundates the floodplain, the concentration of nitrate declines, whereas the concentrations of dissolved organic C and N continue to rise. At high water the floodplain appears to store sediments that are later remobilized. During low water, all fractions except dissolved inorganic C tend to be at minimum concentration. Soluble reactive P, total dissolved P, dissolved inorganic C, and dissolved organic C were successfully modelled as hyperbolic functions of discharge. No significant relationships were found between concentration and discharge for any particulate fraction because the flushing and storage mechanisms affecting these fractions occurred within specific hydrologic phases, rather than as a smooth function of discharge. No significant relationships were found for any nitrogen fraction. For nitrate, and thus for total dissolved N, of which nitrate is a major component, poor conformance to standard models is explained by association of key mechanisms (e.g. uptake) with specific hydrologic phases. Particulate components and nitrate in this sense violate the continuity assumptions implicit in the standard models.
1469145| Sediment (0.5 mm-2.0 mm grain size) was incubated in nylon bags (200 m mesh) below the water table in the channel and in two transects of shallow wells perpendicular to the banks (to 18 m) of a third-order stream during August, 1987. One transect of wells drained steep old-growth forest, and the other a steep 23 year-old clear-cut partially regenerated in alder. At approximately 6-week intervals between October, 1987, and June, 1988, bags were retrieved. Total exchangeable ammonium was determined on sediment, and dissolved oxygen, nitrate and ammonium were determined in stream and well water. Exchangeable ammonium ranged from 10 eq/100 g of sediment in the stream where nitrification potential and subsurface exchange with stream water were high, to 115 eq/100 g sediment 18 m inland where channel water-groundwater mixing and nitrification potential were both low. Sorbed ammonium was highest during summer/autumn base flow and lowest during winter storm flow. Both channel and well water contained measurable dissolved oxygen at all times. Ammonium concentration was typically < 10 g-N/L in channel water, increased with distance inland, but did not exceed 365 g-N/L at any site. Nitrate concentration was typically higher in well water than channel water. Nitrate levels increased dramatically in wells at the base of the clear-cut following the onset of autumn rains. The results indicate a potential for temporary storage of ammonium on riparian sediments which may influence biotic nitrogen cycling, and alter the timing and form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen transport from the watershed. 
1469421|Anion fluxes from a forest soil are usually correlated with those of base cations (BC). Declines in base cation deposition or long-term depletion from the soil may change these relationships. We used multiple regression to identify biogeochemical variables predicting annual volume-weighted concentrations of BC in streamwater draining a forested watershed, and analysis of variance to compare the effects of Ca and Cl inputs on BC fluxes out of soil horizons in irrigated plots. For the watershed, anion concentrations in streamwater predicted BC export most precisely (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.84). The best two-variable model (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91) also included BC concentration in bulk deposition. Consistent with predictions from equations governing exchange chemistry, the proportion of charge contributed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased with increasing total anion concentration, while that of Na<sup>+</sup> decreased. At the plot scale, Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations in treatment solutions had a stronger effect (p = 0.06) on BC concentration in Oa-horizon solutions than did Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (p = 0.33). In individual horizons of individual plots, BC and total ion concentrations were correlated, but cation composition was not consistent within horizons from different plots. This study detected no evidence of long-term cation depletion in the soils controlling streamwater, but did detect extremely base-poor plots. Because acid deposition affects surface horizons first, streamwater chemistry may not be an adequate way to assess nutrient supply of forest soils.
1469618|The fluxes and concentrations of materials from two contiguous second-order watersheds in the Coastal Plain of Maryland, U.S.A. were measured for six years prior to and six years subsequent to the formation of a 1.25 ha beaver pond near the bottom of one of the watersheds. The watersheds have a clay aquiclude and were equipped with V-notch weirs and continuous volume-integrating water samplers. The beaver pond reduced annual discharge of water, total-N, total-P, dissolved silicate, TOC, and TSS by 8, 18, 21, 32, 28, and 27%, respectively. Most of the total-N reduction was due to increased retention of nitrate in the winter and spring and TON in the winter and summer. Most of the total-P reduction was the result of retention of both TPi and TOP in the winter and summer. Dissolved silicate retention peaked in the spring, while TOC and TSS retention peaked in the winter. Prior to the formation of the beaver pond, concentrations of TON, TPi, TOP, TOC, and TSS had highly significant correlations with stream discharge, especially in the winter, but subsequent to the pond there was little or no relationship between these concentrations and stream discharge. However, concentrations of nitrate in the spring and ammonium in the summer were highly correlated with stream discharge both before and after the formation of the beaver pond and regressions of discharge versus concentrations of these nutrients explained more of the variation in concentrations after the formation of the pond.
1469968| A study of the isotopic composition of organic matter was conducted in a freshwater marsh over seasonal and diel time scales to determine the sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the processes leading to its formation. Bulk C and N isotopic compositions of the bacterial fraction (0.2-0.7 m) and particulate organic matter (POM; 0.7-10 m) were compared on a seasonal basis with the change in  <sup>13</sup>C of DOM. The bulk isotopic data support the idea that DOM was, in part, derived from the breakdown of larger organic matter fractions. The bacterial fraction and POM were compositionally similar throughout the year, based on a comparison of the  <sup>13</sup>C of individual amino acids in each fraction. Annual variation in the  <sup>13</sup>C of amino acids in DOM was greater relative to the variation in larger fractions indicating that microbial reworking was an important factor determining the proteinaceous component of DOM. The <sup>13</sup>C enrichment of serine and leucine in each organic matter fraction suggested microbial reworking was an important factor determining organic matter composition during the most productive times of year. Changes in the bulk  <sup>13</sup>C of DOM were more significant over daily, relative to seasonal, time scales where values ranged by 6 and followed changes in chlorophyll a concentrations. Although bulk  <sup>13</sup>C values for POM ranged only from -29 to -28 during the same diel period, the  <sup>13</sup>C of alanine in POM ranged from -30 to -22. Alanine is directly synthesized from pyruvate and is therefore a good metabolic indicator. The  <sup>13</sup>C of individual amino acids in DOM revealed the diel change in the importance of autotrophic versus heterotrophic activity in influencing DOM composition. Diel changes in the  <sup>13</sup>C of phenylalanine, synthesized by common pathways in phytoplankton and bacteria, were similar in both DOM and POM. The diel change in  <sup>13</sup>C of isoleucine and valine, synthesized through different pathways in phytoplankton and bacteria, were distinctly different in DOM versus POM. This disparity indicated a decoupling of the POM and DOM pools, which suggests a greater source of bacterial-derived organic matter at night. The results of this study demonstrate the use of the isotopic composition of individual amino acids in determining the importance of microbial reworking and autotrophic versus heterotrophic contributions to DOM over both diel and seasonal time scales. 
1469490| The methane cycle in constructed wetlands without plants and with Phragmites australis (reed) and Scirpus lacustris (bulrush) was investigated. Variations in CH<sub>4</sub> production largely determined variations in CH<sub>4</sub> emission among the systems, rather than variations in CH<sub>4</sub> storage and oxidation. Twofold lower CH<sub>4</sub> production rates in the Scirpus system (5.6-13 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) relative to the control (16.7-17.6 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) were accompanied by a lower contribution of methanogenesis to organic carbon metabolism (20% for Scirpus vs. 80% for control). Sedimentary iron(II) reservoirs were smaller in the Scirpus than control sediment (300 vs. 485 mmol.m<sup>-2</sup>) and a shuttle role for iron as an intermediate between root O<sub>2</sub> release and carbon oxidation, attenuating the availability of substrate for methanogens, is suggested. Differences in CH<sub>4</sub> production among the Phragmites and Scirpus systems were controlled by the interspecific variation in sediment oxidation capacities of both plant species. Comparatively, in the Phragmites sediment, dissolved iron reservoirs were larger (340 mmol.m<sup>-2</sup>) and methanogenesis was a more important pathway (80%). Methane transport was mainly plant mediated in the Phragmites and Scirpus systems, but ebullition dominated in the non-vegetated control systems as well as in the vegetated systems when plant biomass was low. 
1468730|Aluminum chemistry was evaluated in two headwater streams in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Observed elevational trends in stream aluminum chemistry may be related to spatial variations of vegetation type and mineral soil depth within the watersheds. At the highest elevations maximum densities of spruce and fir vegetation occur and aluminum appears to be mobilized predominantly by transformations involving dissolved organic matter. At the mid-elevations hardwood vegetation predominates and the mechanism of aluminum mobilization shifts to dissolution by strong acids within the mineral soil. At the lowest elevations, relatively thick mineral soil seems to limit aluminum mobility, resulting in low concentrations in streamwater. Comparison of these results with an earlier study of an adjacent watershed, indicates that subtle differences in watershed characteristics such as tree species distribution and topography may cause significant variations in stream aluminum chemistry. Control of aluminum mobility by imogolite minerals was not indicated by the stream chemistry of these watersheds. To determine the relationship between acidic deposition and aluminum mobility, natural variations which occur in the aluminum cycle must be addressed.
1469323|Mercury levels in fish have been demonstrated to increase after impoundment with augmented levels of mercury predicted to decline as the reservoir ages. Previous research in Newfoundland predicted return rates in the order of 10 to 12 years for landlocked Atlantic salmon or ouananiche (Salmo salar) and 7 years for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). In order to test the validity of these predictions on a broader spatial and temporal scale, and develop more generally predictive 'models', mercury levels in three fish species were studied in 16 older Newfoundland hydroelectric reservoirs of various age (32 to 95 years) and area flooded (21 to 13,000 ha). Mercury concentrations were standardized to fish length and correlated with physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the sampling sites. Standard length mercury levels ranged from 0.23 to 0.86 ppm in ouananiche, 0.13 to 0.59 ppm in brook trout, and 0.22 to 0.72 in arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Fish in excess of the Canadian Safety Limit (0.5 ppm) were collected from 14 of 16 sites for ouananiche, 8 of 17 sites for brook trout, and 3 of 7 sites for arctic charr, including control lakes. Standard length fish mercury levels were correlated with reservoir age and (log<sub>10</sub>) area flooded for ouananiche and with pH for arctic charr. A multiple regression model was developed relating standard length mercury in ouananiche with reservoir age and log<sub>10</sub> of the flooded area. There were no apparent relationship between reservoir characteristics and brook trout mercury concentrations. Based on this analysis, it is not possible, at present, to develop generally predictive models for all species found in Newfoundland impoundments.
1469010|Charophyte oosporangia and water samples from a highly calcareous lake were measured for stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition. The time period over which the oosporangia calcify is short, thus any biochemical relationship between the water and oosporangia's calcite represents only one 'time window' (late Summer in Malham Tarn). This important temporal restraint must also apply to interpretations of all fossil material measured. The  <sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub> of the charophyte oosporangia is deduced to be in equilibrium with the  <sup>18</sup>O<sub>w</sub> of the water for a given temperature. The  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>c</sub> of the charophyte oosporangia was approximately 2.5 per mil lower than the  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> in the water we measured. With the release of CO<sub>2</sub> with phosphoric acid from the charophyte oosporangia, there was no significant difference in the  <sup>18</sup>O<sub>c</sub> values obtained, regardless of whether or not the carbonate was separated from the organic center, however  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>c</sub> values were marginally lower for carbonate plus organic center measurements. Our results indicate that fossil charophyte gyrogonites can be used to elucidate the geochemistry of the ancient water body in which they lived.
41490435|Sphagnum-dominated peatlands head the list of ecosystems with the largest known reservoirs of organic carbon (C). The bulk of this C is stored in decomposition-resistant litter of one bryophyte genus: Sphagnum. Understanding how Sphagnum litter chemistry controls C mineralization is essential for understanding potential interactions between environmental changes and C mineralization in peatlands. We aimed to separate the effects of phenolics from structural polysaccharides on decay of Sphagnum. We measured aerobic microbial respiration of different moss litter types in a lab. We used chemical treatments to step-wise remove the chemical compounds thought to be important in decay-resistance in three taxonomically distant moss genera. We also focused on the effect of Sphagnum-specific cell-wall pectin-like polysaccharides (sphagnan) on C and N mineralization. Removing polymeric lignin-like phenolics had only negligible effects on mineralization of Sphagnum litter, but increased mineralization of two other bryophyte genera, suggesting a minor role of these phenolics in decay resistance of Sphagnum but a major role of cell-wall polysaccharides. Carboxyl groups of pectin-like polysaccharides represented a C-source in non-Sphagnum litters but resisted decay in Sphagnum. Finally, isolated sphagnan did not serve as C-source but inhibited C and N mineralization instead, reminiscent of the effects reported for phenolics in other ecosystems. Our results emphasize the role of polysaccharides in resistance to, and active inhibition of, microbial mineralization in Sphagnum-dominated litter. As the polysaccharides displayed decay-inhibiting properties hitherto associated with phenolics (lignin, polyphenols), it raises the question if polysaccharide-dominated litter also shares similar environmental controls on decomposition, such as temperature or nutrient and water availability.
41410569|In the last decades, in particular forest ecosystems became increasingly N saturated due to elevated atmospheric N deposition, resulting from anthropogenic N emission. This led to serious consequences for the environment such as N leaching to the groundwater. Recent efforts to reduce N emissions raise the question if, and over what timescale, ecosystems recover to previous conditions. In order to study the effects on N distribution and N transformation processes under the lowered N deposition treatment, we investigated the fate of deposited NH -N in soil of a N-saturated Norway spruce forest (current N deposition: 34 kg ha year ; critical N load: 14 kg ha year ), where N deposition has been reduced to 11.5 kg ha year since 14.5 years. We traced the deposited N in needle litter, bulk soil, and amino acids, microbial biomass and inorganic N in soil. Under reduced N deposition, 123  23% of the deposited N was retained in bulk soil, while this was only 72  15% under ambient deposition. We presume that with reduced deposition the amount of deposited N was small enough to become completely immobilized in plant and soil and no leaching losses occurred. Trees receiving reduced N deposition showed a decline in N content as well as in N incorporation into needle litter, indicating reduced N plant uptake. In contrast, the distribution of N within the soil over active microbial biomass, microbial residues and inorganic N was not affected by the reduced N deposition. We conclude that the reduction in N deposition impacted only plant uptake and drainage losses, while microbial N transformation processes were not influenced. We assume changes in the biological N turnover to start with the onset of the decomposition of the new, N-depleted litter.
1468586|Carbon cycling processes in ecosystems are generally believed to be well understood. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and other essential elements are chemically converted from inorganic to organic compounds primarily in the process of photosynthesis. Secondary metabolic processes cycle carbon in and among organisms and carbon is ultimately released back to the environment as CO<sub>2</sub> by respiratory processes. Unfortunately, our understanding of this cycle was determined under the assumption that the primary inorganic form of C (CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere) was relatively constant. With the emerging concensus that atmospheric carbon concentration is increasing, we must now reassess our understanding of the carbon cycle. How will plants, animals and decomposers respond to a doubling of carbon supply? Will biological productivity be accelerated? If plant productivity increases will a predictable percentage of the increase be accumulated as increased standing crop? Or, is it possible that doubling the availability of CO<sub>2</sub> will increase metabolic activity at all trophic levels resulting in no net increase in system standing crop? The purpose of this paper is to review evidence for physiological and growth responses of plants to carbon dioxide enhancement. Essentially no research has been completed on the ecological aspects of these questions. From this review, I conclude that accurate predictions of future ecosystem responses to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration are not possible without additional understanding of physiological and ecological mechanisms.
4151468|Some of the largest riverine N fluxes in the continental USA have been observed in agricultural regions with extensive artificial subsurface drainage, commonly called tile drainage. The degree to which high riverine N fluxes in these settings are due to high net N inputs (NNI), greater transport efficiency caused by the drainage systems, or other factors is not known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of tile drainage by comparing NNI and riverine N fluxes in regions of Illinois with similar climate and crop production practices but with different intensities of tile drainage. Annual values of NNI between 1940 and 1999 were estimated from county level agricultural production statistics and census estimates of human population. During 1945-1961, riverine nitrate flux in the extensively tile drained region averaged 6.6kg
1468536|Comparison of total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentration, nutrient loading, and water turn-over time in six shallow choked lagoons along the coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, established that water turn-over time is related to the trophic state of the lagoons with additional anthropogenic nutrient loading affecting this relationship. Turnover time was calculated as a flushing half-life from rainfall, evaporation, runoff, and tidal exchange data, and trophic state was calculated from the quantity and quality of dissolved inorganic nutrients, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a standing stock. Flushing half-life of the lagoons ranged between 1 and 27 days, annual phosphorus areal loading from 3 to 18 mg m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>, and chlorophyll-a standing stock from 6 to 160 mg m<sup>-2</sup>.
1469942| Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to increase methane emissions in herbaceous wetlands, but it is not clear that this will occur in wetlands dominated by woody plants or in wetlands that are not in-undated. We determined the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and water table position on methane emission and oxidation rates from plant-soil microcosms planted with a woody tree, Taxodium distichum, or an emergent aquatic macrophyte, Orontium aquaticum. Experiments were conducted in replicate glasshouses (n = 2) at CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of either 350 or 700 ppmv. Plants were grown from seed and subjected to two water level depths, flooded (+5 cm above the soil surface) and non-flooded (-10 cm for T. distichum and -6 cm for O. aquaticum). Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> increased whole-plant photosynthetic rates in both water table treatments. Methane emission rates increased by 62 to 69% in the T. distichum treatment and 27 to 29% in the O. aquaticum treatment. Whole-plant photosynthesis and biomass were strongly correlated with methane emissions (r<sup>2</sup>  0.75, P  0.01). This relationship provides evidence of a tight coupling between plant and microbial activity and suggests that similar relationships from other wetland studies measured at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> can be extrapolated into the future. In the O. aquaticum, non-flooded treatment, methanotrophy consumed 14 and 22% (replicate glasshouses) of the methane produced in the ambient treatment compared to 29 and 36% in the elevated CO<sub>2</sub> treatment. However, there was no significant methane oxidation detected in the flooded treatment. We concluded that woody and non-woody wetland ecosystems growing in a future CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched atmosphere will emit more methane regardless of water table position, but the degree of stimulation will be sensitive to changes in water table position, particularly in forested wetlands. 
1469474|The seasonal variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux in a Mediterranean stream subjected to discharges of wide range of intensities and variable dry period was studied as a function of the hydrologic conditions, and the relationship between surface and subsurface (hyporheic and groundwater) DOC concentration. DOC concentration in stream water (2.6 mg l<sup>-1</sup> 1.5 SD) was higher than groundwater (1.3 mg l<sup>-1</sup> 1.2 SD) and lower than hyporheic water (3.8 mg l<sup>-1</sup> 1.7 SD), suggesting that, at baseflow, stream DOC concentration increases when groundwater discharges through the hyporheic zone. Storms contributed to 39% of annual water export and to 52% of the total annual DOC export (220 kg km<sup>-2</sup>). A positive relationship was observed between Discharge (Q) and stream DOC concentration. Discharge explained only 40% of the annual variance in stream DOC, but explained up to 93% of the variance within floods. The rate of stream DOC changes with discharge change during storms (dDOC/dQ), ranged between 0 and 0.0045 C mg l<sup>-1</sup> s l<sup>-1</sup>, with minimum values during Spring and Summer, and maxima values in Fall and Winter. These dynamics suggest that storm inputs of terrigenous DOC vary between seasons. During floods in the dormant season, DOC recession curves were always steeper than discharge decline, suggesting short flushing of DOC from the leaching of fresh detritus stored in the riparian zone.
1469928| Overwinter and snowmelt processes are thought to be critical to controllers of nitrogen (N) cycling and retention in northern forests. However, there have been few measurements of basic N cycle processes (e.g. mineralization, nitrification, denitrification) during winter and little analysis of the influence of winter climate on growing season N dynamics. In this study, we manipulated snow cover to assess the effects of soil freezing on in situ rates of N mineralization, nitrification and soil respiration, denitrification (intact core, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> - based method), microbial biomass C and N content and potential net N mineralization and nitrification in two sugar maple and two yellow birch stands with reference and snow manipulation treatment plots over a two year period at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, U.S.A. The snow manipulation treatment, which simulated the late development of snowpack as may occur in a warmer climate, induced mild (temperatures > -5 C) soil freezing that lasted until snowmelt. The treatment caused significant increases in soil nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) concentrations in sugar maple stands, but did not affect mineralization, nitrification, denitrification or microbial biomass, and had no significant effects in yellow birch stands. Annual N mineralization and nitrification rates varied significantly from year to year. Net mineralization increased from  12.0 g N m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in 1998 to  22 g N m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in 1999 and nitrification increased from  8 g N m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in 1998 to  13 g N m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in 1999. Denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 0.65 g N m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>. Our results suggest that mild soil freezing must increase soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels by physical disruption of the soil ecosystem and not by direct stimulation of mineralization and nitrification. Physical disruption can increase fine root mortality, reduce plant N uptake and reduce competition for inorganic N, allowing soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> levels to increase even with no increase in net mineralization or nitrification. 
1469883|A hydrogeologic model of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to the near-shore environment at a site on the northeast Gulf of Mexico has been developed to provide a basis for comparison with measurements of SGD made using seepage meters, and with estimates derived from chemical tracers. The hydrogeologic model incorporates the seaward movement of fresh water and the recirculation of sea water at the fresh water-salt water interface. The hydrostratigraphy at the site includes the Surficial Aquifer, a thin confining unit known as the Intracoastal Formation, and the underlying Upper Floridan Aquifer. It is not possible to explain either the magnitude or spatial distribution of SGD recorded by the seepage meters, or the magnitude of SGD estimated using radium and radon tracers, if only steady state flow in the Surficial Aquifer is considered. Nor does it appear likely that the difference between the model-based prediction of SGD and the field-based estimates can be fully resolved by leakage across the Intracoastal Formation from a source in the Floridan Aquifer. These results suggest that processes driven by variations in fluid pressure in the marine water column, which occur on a variety of time scales, be examined to quantify their contribution to fluid circulation within and discharge from that segment of the Surficial Aquifer located beyond the low tide line.
20055314|Few studies have examined the invasion of understory species into closed-canopy forests and, despite inter-specific differences in litter quality and quantity between understory and dominant canopy trees, the influence of understory invasions on soil nitrogen (N) cycling remains unknown. This paper examines litter quality and decomposition of kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), an invasive understory herb, to determine the influence of this species on N cycling in a Hawaiian montane rainforest. To examine the potential feedback between increased soil N availability and litter decomposition, litter from the invasive ginger, a native tree, and native tree fern was collected from unfertilized and fertilized plots and decomposed in a reciprocal transplant design. Hedychium litter decomposed faster than litter from the two native species. Across species, decomposition rates were negatively correlated with litter lignin content. Despite rapid decomposition rates of Hedychium litter, soil nitrogen availability and rates of net mineralization in the soil were similar in invaded and uninvaded plots. Nitrogen cycling at this site may be more strongly influenced by native species, which contribute the most to overall stand biomass. A negative effect of fertilization on the decomposition of Hedychium litter suggests that a negative feedback between litter quality and soil N availability may exist over longer timescales.
24715104|The important role of soil carbon (C) in the global C cycle has stimulated interest in better understanding the mechanisms regulating soil C storage and its stabilization. Exotic earthworm invasion of northern forest soils in North America can affect soil C pools, and we examined their effects on these mechanisms by adding C labeled leaf litter to adjacent northern hardwood forests with and without earthworms. Two types of labeled litter were produced, one with the C more concentrated in structural (S) components and the other in non-structural (NS) components, to evaluate the role of biochemical differences in soil C stabilization. Earthworm invasions have reduced soil C storage in the upper 20 cm of the soil profile by 37 %, mostly by eliminating surface organic horizons. Despite rapid mixing of litter into mineral soil and its incorporation into aggregates, mineral soil C has not increased in the presence of earthworms. Incorporation of litter C into soil and microbial biomass was not affected by biochemical differences between S versus NS labeled litter although NS litter C was assimilated more readily into earthworm biomass and S litter C into fungal hyphae. Apparently, the net effect of earthworm mixing of litter and forest floor C into mineral soil, plus stabilization of that C in aggregates, is counterbalanced by earthworm bioturbation and possible priming effects. Our results support recent arguments that biochemical recalcitrance is not a major contributor to the stabilization of soil C.
1469244| A 12-month study was conducted to measure the concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOC, TDN, TDP) in four sites within a 119 km long reach of the Ohio River, near Louisville, KY. In this study we test whether specific geomorphological and biological factors influenced variations in dissolved organic matter. Concentrations of DOC in the river averaged 1200 mol/L, and varied by nearly two orders of magnitude seasonally (mean DOC during base flow 620 mol/L). Peak periods for DOC at all sites were during April-May. The site nearest a navigation dam (deeper, lower current velocities) had significantly lower concentrations of TDN and greater C:N ratios than upstream sites. The largest tributary entering this reach (Kentucky River) had no significant effect on levels of DOM in the main river, despite having significantly greater concentrations of TDN and lower levels of DOC during most months of the year. Concentrations of DOC, TDN, and TDP were not significantly different in littoral and pelagic habitats at all sites studied, suggesting little floodplain influence on DOM in this constricted-channel section of the Ohio River. C:N ratios of DOM in the Ohio were significantly different among seasons; C:N exceeded or equaled Redfield ratios in summer and fall (6 to 10), but were below Redfield (1.8 to 3.0) during winter and spring. Regression models suggest that total phytoplankton densities and flow conditions are the two most important factors regulating DOM in this very large river. 
20456533|Plants accumulate significant amounts of atmospheric mercury (Hg) in aboveground biomass, likely sequestering over 1,000 Mg of atmospheric Hg every year. This large mercury uptake could be strong enough to affect tropospheric Hg levels and might be partially responsible for seasonal variations in atmospheric Hg observed at Mace Head, Ireland. The fluctuations of Hg concentrations coincide temporally with the annual oscillation of carbon dioxide (CO) in the Northern Hemisphere, which is a result of seasonal growth of vegetation. Therefore, declining Hg concentrations in spring and summer may be attributed in part to plant uptake of atmospheric Hg. Further, the increase of Hg concentrations during non-active vegetation periods might partially be due to plant-derived Hg emitting back to the atmosphere during carbon mineralization. The implications of these propositions are that past and future changes in biomass productivity and organic carbon pools may have had--and may continue to have--significant effects on atmospheric Hg levels. Specifically, large losses in soil and biomass carbon pools in the last 150 years could have contributed significantly to observed increases in atmospheric Hg pollution. The roles of vegetation and terrestrial carbon pools should receive detailed consideration on how they might attenuate or exacerbate atmospheric Hg pollution.
41490529|Bulk precipitation and throughfall were collected in a wet lowland rainforest in SW Costa Rica on an event basis to allow modelling the contributions of dry deposition and canopy exchange to nutrient inputs and internal cycling of nutrients. Estimates based on bulk precipitation underestimated total atmospheric deposition to tropical rainforests by up to 10-fold ignoring the contributions of dry deposition. Canopy exchange contributed most of the aboveground inputs to the forest soil of Na, about half for K + , 10% for P and Mg and negligible for N, C and other elements. Tree species composition did not account for the differences found in net throughfall between forest sites, and vegetation structure (plant area index) had only a small effect on net throughfall. Forest regrowth affected net throughfall through reduced soil fertility and differences in leaf traits. Topography most significantly affected net throughfall via increased dry deposition at sites of higher elevation and via soil fertility and increased canopy exchange at down slope sites.
1468532|Sediment cores from lakes located in the Pantanal Swamp, Central Brazil were analysed for the distribution of mercury released by the local gold mining. Atmospheric transport is the only pathway of mercury contamination of these remote lakes. Mercury concentrations were higher at the surface of sediments (62 to 80 ug.kg<sup>-1</sup>) decreasing to values of 20 to 30 ug.kg<sup>-1</sup> in deeper layers. Mercury deposition rate was estimated as 90 to 120 ug Hg.m<sup>-2</sup>.yr<sup>-1</sup>. Although mercury concentrations were much lower than in industrialized areas, mercury deposition rate for these Pantanal lakes is of the same order of magnitude of deposition rates measured in lakes in industrialized areas.
1469579|Clarification of carbon content characteristics, on their spatial variability in density, of tropical peatlands is needed for more accurate estimates of the C pools and more detailed C cycle understandings. In this study, the C density characteristics of different peatland types and at various depths within tropical peats in Central Kalimantan were analyzed. The peatland types and the land cover types were classified by land system map and remotely sensed data of multi-temporal AVHRR composites (1-km pixel size), respectively. Differences in the mean values of volumetric C density (CD<sub>V</sub>) were found among peatland types owing to the variability in physical consolidation from peat decomposition or nutrient inputs, although no vertical trends of CD<sub>V</sub> were found. Using a step-wise regression technique, geographic variables and the categories of peatland type and land cover type were found to explain 54% of the variability of CD<sub>V</sub> within tropical peatlands in some conditions.
41410567|In late-successional steady state ecosystems, plants and microbes compete for nutrients and nutrient retention efficiency is expected to decline when inputs exceed biotic demand. In carbon (C)-poor environments typical of early primary succession, nitrogen (N) uptake by C-limited microbes may be limited by inputs of detritus and exudates derived from contemporaneous plant production. If plants are N-limited in these environments, then this differential limitation may lead to positive relationships between N inputs and N retention efficiency. Further, the mechanisms of N removal may vary as a function of inputs if plant-derived C promotes denitrification. These hypotheses were tested using field surveys and greenhouse microcosms simulating the colonization of desert stream channel sediments by herbaceous vegetation. In field surveys of wetland (cinega) and gravelbed habitat, plant biomass was positively correlated with nitrate (NO) concentration. Manipulation of NO in flow-through microcosms produced positive relationships among NO supply, plant production, and tissue N content, and a negative relationship with root: shoot ratio. These results are consistent with N limitation of herbaceous vegetation in Sycamore Creek and suggest that N availability may influence transitions between and resilience of wetland and gravelbed stable states in desert streams. Increased biomass in high N treatments resulted in elevated rates of denitrification and shifts from co-limitation by C and NO to limitation by NO alone. Overall NO retention efficiency and the relative importance of denitrification increased with increasing N inputs. Thus the coupling of plant growth and microbial processes in low C environments alters the relationship between N inputs and exports due to increased N removal under high input regimes that exceed assimilative demand.
40343748|The determination of optical properties of organic matter using spectroscopic techniques is a powerful tool for the characterization of humic substances (HS) in soils and sediments because of sensitivity, specificity and sample throughput. However, basic spectroscopic techniques have practical limitations because of the similarity in the optical properties of many HS. To improve resolution, the combination of excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was applied for characterizing fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) fractions from soils and sediments of two estuarine environments in Spain. Five fluorescent components were identified by EEM-PARAFAC and were found in both FA and HA fractions, consistent with the new paradigm of HS as supramolecular associations as well as the ubiquity of the HS components in the environment. Their contribution was, however, different between the FA and HA fractions. Two different, humic-like, fluorescent components were representative of FA and HA fractions, respectively. The spectral characteristics of these components were similar to previously reported PARAFAC components in dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a wide range of environments, suggesting their applicability in assessing OM quality and environmental dynamics. A microbial humic-like component was much more abundant in FA than in HA fractions. Furthermore, principal component analysis clarified that the two identified protein-like components, were enriched in sediment HA compared to soil HA, suggesting a larger contribution of refractory algaenan in sediment HA. The results of the present study demonstrate that EEM-PARAFAC is a useful technique for the biogeochemical characterization of soil and sedimentary HS.
20456476|The association of Phaeocystis spp. with small pennate diatoms during three Phaeocystis-dominated spring blooms were investigated in the Eastern English Channel (2003 and 2004) and in coastal waters of Western Norway during a mesocosm experiment (2005). In each of these studies, colonization of the surface of large Phaeocystis spp. colonies by small needle-shaped diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia spp.) were observed. In the English Channel the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima colonized the surface of large (&gt;100 m) Phaeocystis globosa colonies. The abundance of Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima reached 130 cells per colony and formed up to 70% of the total carbon associated with Phaeocystis cells during late bloom stages. In Norwegian waters, the surface of large (&gt;250 m) Phaeocystis pouchetii colonies were colonized by Pseudonitzschia cf. granii var. curvata and to a lesser degree by other phytoplankton and protist species, although the abundance of these diatoms was never greater than 40 cells per colony. Based on these observations we suggest that diatoms utilize Phaeocystis colonies not only as habitat, but that they are able to utilize the colonial matrix as a growth substrate. Furthermore, these observations indicate that a considerable fraction of biomass (chlorophyll) associated with Phaeocystis colonies, especially large colonies concerned with intense and prolonged blooms, are due to cooccurring plankton species and not exclusively Phaeocystis cells.
1469243|Long-term changes in concentrations of available Ca in soils of red spruce forests have been documented, but remaining questions about the magnitude and regional extent of these changes have precluded an assessment of the current and future status of soil Ca. To address this problem, soil samples were collected in 1992-93 from 12 sites in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine to provide additional data necessary to synthesize all available research results on soil Ca in red spruce forests. Sites were chosen to encompass the range of environmental conditions experienced by red spruce. Concentrations of exchangeable Ca ranged from 2.13 to 21.6 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> in the Oa horizon, and from 0.11 to 0.68 cmol<sub>c</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> in the upper 10 cm of the B horizon. These measurements expanded the range of exchangeable Ca reported in the literature for both horizons in northeastern red spruce forests. Exchangeable Ca was the largest Ca fraction in the forest floor at most sites (92% of acid-extractable Ca), but mineral Ca was the largest fraction at the three sites that also had the highest mineral-matter concentrations. The primary factor causing variability in Ca concentrations among sites was the mineralogy of parent material, but exchangeable concentrations in the B horizon of all sites were probably reduced by acidic deposition. Because the majority of Ca in the forest floor is in a readily leachable form, and Ca inputs to the forest floor from the mineral soil and atmospheric deposition have been decreasing in recent decades, the previously documented decreases in Ca concentrations in the forest floor over previous decades may extend into the future.
25652627|Rapid industrialization in East Asia is causing adverse effects due to atmospheric deposition in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Decreasing stream pH and alkalinity and increasing NO concentrations were observed throughout the 1990s in the forested Lake Ijira catchment in central Japan. We investigated these changes using data on atmospheric deposition, soil chemistry, stream water chemistry, and forest growth. Average atmospheric depositions (wet + dry) of 0.83, 0.57, and 1.37 kmol ha year for hydrogen, sulfur, and nitrogen, respectively, were among the highest levels in Japan. Atmospheric deposition generally decreased before 1994 and increased thereafter. The catchment was acidsensitive; stream alkalinity was low (134 mol c l) and pH in surface mineral soils decreased from 4.5 in 1990 to 3.9 in 2003. Stream NO concentration nearly doubled (from 22 to 42 mol c l) from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. Stream NO concentration was controlled primarily by water temperature before 1996/1997 and by stream discharge thereafter. Stream NO concentrations decreased during the growing season before 1996/1997, but this seasonality was lost thereafter. The catchment became nitrogen-saturated (changing from stage 1 to 2) in 1996/1997, possibly because of declining forest growth rates due to the 1994 summer drought, defoliation of Japanese red pine by pine wilt disease, maturation of Japanese cedar stands, and stimulation of nitrogen mineralization and nitrification due to alkalinization of soils (increased exchangeable Ca and soil pH) after the summer drought. Stream pH and alkalinity began decreasing in 1996/1997. The enhanced growing-season NO discharge since 1996/1997 appeared to be the major cause of stream acidification. Increased atmospheric deposition since 1994 may have contributed to this change.
41410552|Impacts of long-term drying and associated vegetation change on anaerobic decomposition, methane production, and pore water composition in peat bogs are poorly documented. To identify some of these impacts, we analyzed peat humification, pore water solutes, in situ and in vitro respiration rates, and Gibbs free energies of methanogenesis in a bog near a drainage ditch established in 1923. We compared drained peat under open bog vegetation and forest with a bog reference site. Drainage and tree growth induced an enrichment in carboxylic, aromatic, and phenolic moieties in the peat. Short-term in vitro respiration rates significantly decreased with humification (R > 0.6, P < 0.01). Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CH concentrations also attained lower maxima in drained areas. However, near the water table in situ respiration intensified as indicated by steeper increases in DIC and CH concentrations than at the reference site, especially under forest. Maximum in situ CO production derived from inverse pore water modeling was 10.3 nmol cm d (forest) and 6.3 nmol cm d 10.3 nmol cm d (bog) and was one to two orders of magnitude slower than in vitro anaerobic respiration. In the highly decomposed shallow peats under forest, methane production was suppressed and DOC concentration elevated. Raised H concentrations (up to 200 nmol 1) and in situ Gibbs free energies of down to -60 kJ mol (CH) suggested an inhibition of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by an unidentified factor at these sites. The study documents that several changes in biogeochemical process patterns do occur post-drainage, especially when tree growth is triggered. Most importantly, the establishment of forest on intensely humified peats can lower in situ methane production.
1469918|Soil properties of terrestrial ecosystems are controlled by a variety of factors that operate at different scales. We tested the role of abiotic and biotic factors that potentially influence spatial gradients of total ion content, acidity, carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorous in topsoil. We studied a network of Mediterranean montane meadows that spans a 2000-m altitudinal gradient. The analyzed factors were grouped into two spatial scales: a landscape scale (climate and land form) and a field scale (topography, soil texture, soil moisture, and plant community composition). Total ion content and acidity are the major and independent variation trends of soil geochemistry. Soil acidity, carbon, and nitrogen increased along the altitudinal gradient whereas there was no relationship between total ion content and phosphorous and elevation. Climate had no direct influence on the analyzed gradients; all effects of climate were indirect through plant community composition and/or soil moisture. The results point to three types of models that explain the gradients of soil chemical composition: (1) a predominantly biotic control of carbon and nitrogen, (2) a predominantly abiotic control of acidity, and (3) a combined biotic and abiotic control of total ionic content. No direct or indirect effects explained the gradient of phosphorous. In our study region (central Spain), climate is predicted to turn more arid and soils will lose moisture. According to our models, this will result in less acid and fertile soils, and any change in plant community composition will modify gradients of soil carbon, nitrogen, total ion content, and acidity.
1469649| The impact of the spring phytoplanktonic blooms on the partition of nutrients and metals between the dissolved and particulate phases was studied over two years in the river Marne, upstream of its confluence with the river Seine. Particular attention was devoted to copper and manganese, determined in the dissolved phase (< 0.22 m), subdivided into the colloidal phase and the 'truly dissolved' phase (< 10 KDaltons) obtained by tangential ultrafiltration. During the algal growth peaks, a sharp reduction of nutrients was observed in the dissolved phase: in 1994, consumption of 70% of silica, 50% of ammonium and 40% of soluble phosphorus present before the phytoplanktonic bloom. The water concentration peaks of suspended matter (SM) and of particulate metals, phosphorus and carbon coincide with those of chlorophyll. The highly significant correlations between pH and chlorophyll (r = 0.92, P < 0.001), pH and SM (r = 0.97, P < 0.001) and chlorophyll and SM (r = 0.93, P < 0.001) confirmed the phytoplanktonic nature of SM and the determining role of pH in the partition of metals, its increase being responsible for the coprecipitation of metal. As a corollary to the increase in the particulate phase, a decrease of 55% was observed for copper and manganese in the 'truly dissolved' phase compared to the concentrations outside bloom periods. The importance of the colloidal fraction was also shown. During the strong algal growth periods, the proportion of 'colloidal metal' in the dissolved phase (< 0.22 m) reached 60% and the increase in the colloidal fraction was 4 times stronger for copper than for manganese. While manganese seemed to be more associated with macroparticles, copper was more associated with fine colloidal biological particles intrinsic to the phytoplankton. 
24716794|We used various approaches to establish a comprehensive budget of methane (CH) emissions from the Seine basin, including direct emissions from livestock and soils as well as emissions from the drainage network. For the direct emissions from livestock, we used official livestock census numbers and emission factors (CH emitted by each animal species per head per year) available in the literature. For the emissions from soils, we based our estimates on experimental measurements in closed chambers installed on differenct agricultural plots, forest, and grasslands in 2008 and 2009. The results were extrapolated to the whole Seine basin, including grassland, cropland, and forest soil distributions in the Seine basin. The CH emissions from the Seine drainage network were also based on measurements of sampled waters in various rivers and streams (from headwaters to estuary) during different seasons in 2007, 2008, and 2010. After chemical analysis of CH concentrations in the water samples using a gas chromatographic technique and calculation of the CH supersaturation by stream order in rivers of the Seine basin (from 1 to 8) and by season we could estimate the CH emissions for the whole water surface area of the Seine drainage network. The livestock of the Seine basin produce CH emissions amounting to 166  10 kg C year, among which cattle are responsible for 85 %. The total CH emission from the Seine drainage network was estimated at 0.3  10 kg C year, large rivers being responsible for the largest proportion. Ebullition could account for an additional 0.2  10 kg C year. Soils of the Seine basin are a net sink for CH (9.4  10 kg C year). The water and soils fluxes are low with regard to emissions by livestock, but domestic waste, through landfills, could contribute an additional 40  10 kg C year.
1469200| The relationships between the abundance and activity of planktonic, heterotrophic microorganisms and the quantity and characteristics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in a Rocky Mountain stream were evaluated. Peak values of glucose uptake, 2.1 nmol L<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>, and glucose concentration, 333 nM, occurred during spring snowmelt when the water temperature was 4.0 C and the DOC concentration was greatest. The turnover time of the in situ glucose pool ranged seasonally from 40-1110 hours, with a mean of 272 hr. Seasonal uptake of <sup>3</sup>H-glucose, particulate ATP concentrations, and direct counts of microbial biomass were independent of temperature, but were positively correlated with DOC concentrations and negatively correlated with stream discharge. Heterotrophic activity in melted snow was generally low, but patchy. In the summer, planktonic heterotrophic activity and microbial biomass exhibited small-scale diel cycles which did not appear to be related to fluctuations in discharge or DOC, but could be related to the activity of benthic invertebrates. Leaf-packs placed under the snow progressively lost weight and leachable organic material during the winter, indicating that the annual litterfall in the watershed may be one source of the spring flush of DOC. These results indicate that the availability of labile DOC to the stream ecosystem is the primary control on seasonal variation in heterotrophic activity of planktonic microbial populations. 
1469810|Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) may play an important role in plant nutrition and nitrogen fluxes in forest ecosystems. In spite of the apparent importance of DON, there is a paucity of information concerning its chemical composition. However, it is exactly this chemical characterization that is required to understand the importance of DON in ecosystem processes. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the distribution of free amino acids and hydrolyzable peptides/proteins in the DON fraction of Oa horizon leachates along an extreme edaphic gradient in northern California. In situ soil solutions were extracted by centrifugation from Oa horizons collected beneath Pinus muricata (Bishop pine) and Cupressus pygmaea (pygmy cypress) on slightly acidic/fertile and highly acidic/infertile sites. DON accounted for 77 to 99% of the total dissolved nitrogen in Oa horizon leachates. Nitrogen in free amino acids and alkyl amines ranged from 0.04-0.07 mg N/L on the low fertility site to 0.45-0.49 mg N/L on the high fertility site, and accounted for 1.5 to 10.6% of the DON fraction. Serine, glutamic acid, leucine, ornithine, alanine, aspartic acid and methylamine were generally the most abundant free amino compounds. Combined amino acids released by acid hydrolysis accounted for 48 to 74% of the DON, suggesting that proteins and peptides were the main contributor to DON in Oa horizon leachates. Together, nitrogen from free and combined amino compounds accounted for 59 to 78% of the DON. Most of the DON was found in the hydrophobic fraction, which suggests the presence of protein/peptide-polyphenol complexes or amino compounds associated with humic substances. Because free and combined amino acids can be an important nitrogen source for some plants, soil DON may play an important role in plant nutrition and ecosystem function.
20055174|The Adirondack region of New York is characterized by soils and surface waters that are sensitive to inputs of strong acids, receiving among the highest rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in the United States. Atmospheric N deposition to Adirondack ecosystems may contribute to the acidification of soils through losses of exchangeable basic cations and the acidification of surface waters in part due to increased mobility of nitrate (NO). This response is particularly evident in watersheds that exhibit 'nitrogen saturation.' To evaluate the contribution of atmospheric N deposition to the N export and the capacity of lake-containing watersheds to remove, store, or release N, annual N input-output budgets were estimated for 52 lake-containing watersheds in the Adirondack region from 1998 to 2000. Wet N deposition was used as the N input and the lake N discharge loss was used as the N output based on modeled hydrology and measured monthly solute concentrations. Annual outputs were also estimated for dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Wet N deposition increased from the northeast to the southwest across the region. Lake N drainage losses, which exhibited a wider range of values than wet N deposition, did not show any distinctive spatial pattern, although there was some evidence of a relationship between wet N deposition and the lake N drainage loss. Wet N deposition was also related to the fraction of N removed or retained within the watersheds (i.e., the fraction of net N hydrologic flux relative to wet N deposition, calculated as [(wet N deposition minus lake N drainage loss)/wet N deposition]). In addition to wet N deposition, watershed attributes also had effects on the exports of NO, ammonium (NH), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and DOC, the DOC/DON export ratio, and the N flux removed or retained within the watersheds (i.e., net N hydrologic flux, calculated as [wet N deposition less lake N drainage loss]). Elevation was strongly related with the lake drainage losses of NO, NH, and DON, net NO hydrologic flux (i.e., NO deposition less NO drainage loss), and the fraction of net NO hydrologic flux, but not with the DOC drainage loss. Both DON and DOC drainage losses from the lakes increased with the proportion of watershed area occupied by wetlands, with a stronger relationship for DOC. The effects of wetlands and forest type on NO flux were evident for the estimated NO fluxes flowing from the watershed drainage area into the lakes, but were masked in the drainage losses flowing out of the lakes. The DOC/DON export ratios from the lake-containing watersheds were in general lower than those from forest floor leachates or streams in New England and were intermediate between the values of autochthonous and allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM) reported for various lakes. The DOC/DON ratios for seepage lakes were lower than those for drainage lakes. In-lake processes regulating N exports may include denitrification, planktonic depletion, degradation of DOM, and the contribution of autochthonous DOM and the influences of in-lake processes were also reflected in the relationships with hydraulic retention time. The N fluxes removed or stored within the lakes substantially varied among the lakes. Our analysis demonstrates that for these northern temperate lake-containing watershed ecosystems, many factors, including atmospheric N deposition, landscape features, hydrologic flowpaths, and retention in ponded waters, regulated the spatial patterns of net N hydrologic flux within the lake-containing watersheds and the loss of N solutes through drainage waters.
1469669|Based on litter mass and litterfall data, decomposition rates for leaves were found to be fast (k = 3.3) and the turnover times short (3.6 mo) on the low-nutrient sandy soils of Korup. Leaf litter of four ectomycorrhizal tree species (Berlinia bracteosa, Didelotia africana, Microberlinia bisulcata and Tetraberlinia bifoliolata) and of three non-ectomycorrhizal species (Cola verticillata, Oubanguia alata and Strephonema pseudocola) from Korup were left to decompose in 2-mm mesh bags on the forest floor in three plots of each of two forest types forest of low (LEM) and high (HEM) abundance of ectomycorrhizal (caesalp) trees. The litter of the ectomycorrhizal species decayed at a significantly slower rate than that of the non-ectomycorrhizal species, although the former were richer in P and N concentrations of the start. Disappearance rates of the litter layer showed a similar trend. Ectomycorrhizal species immobilized less N, but mineralized more P, than non-ectomycorrhizal species. Differences between species groups in K, Mg and Ca mineralization were negligible. Effect of forest type was clear only for Mg: mineralization of Mg was faster in the HEM than LEM plots, a pattern repeated across all species. This difference was attributed to a much more prolific fine root mat in the HEM than LEM forest. The relatively fast release of P from the litter of the ectomycorrhizal species suggests that the mat must allow an efficient uptake to maintain P in the forest ecosystem.
1468759|The effects of cultivation and soil texture on net and gross N mineralization, CO<sub>2</sub> evolution and C and N turnover were investigated using paired grassland and cropped sites on soils of three textures. Gross N mineralization and immobilization were measured using <sup>15</sup>N-isotope dilution. Grassland soils had high CO<sub>2</sub> evolution and gross N mineralization rates, and low net N mineralization rates. Cropland soils had low CO<sub>2</sub> evolution rates but had high net and gross N mineralization rates. Grassland soils thus had high immobilization rates and cropland soils had low immobilization rates. Cultivation increased N turnover but reduced C turnover. The data suggest that the microflora in grassland soils are N limited, while those of cropland soils are limited by C availability. Increasing clay content reduced N turnover. C turnover was less clearly related to texture. Differences in the immobilization potential of substrates help explain why agricultural soils have higher N losses than do grassland soils.
1469210|Cone Pond is one of the few acidic, clear-water ponds in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, a region dominated by high inputs of strong acids from atmospheric deposition and low base content of bedrock. Monitoring was conducted for 13 months to compare and contrast the acid-base chemistry of the terrestrial and aquatic portions of the watershed. Variations in Al concentration and speciation in drainage waters were correlated with changes in the supply of naturally occurring organic ligands. During the study period, the pond retained 28% of Al inputs, including nearly half of the inputs of organically complexed Al. Chemical equilibrium calculations indicated that the entire water-column was oversaturated with respect to the solubility of synthetic gibbsite during summer, as was the hypolimnion during winter. Retention of Al resulted from an increase in pH in the hypolimnion concomitant with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction, and from loss of organic anions in epilimnetic waters. Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) generated in the pond primarily through SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction and base cation (C<sub>B</sub>) release was balanced by ANC consumed as a result of Al retention.
1468696|Aboveground nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) requirement, retranslocation and use efficiency were determined for 28-year-old red oak (Quercus rubra L.), European larch (Larix decidua Miller), white pine (Pinus strobus L.), red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) plantations on a similar soil in southwestern Wisconsin. Annual aboveground N and P requirements (kg/ha/yr) totaled 126 and 13 for red oak, 86 and 9 for European larch, 80 and 9 for white pine, 38 and 6 for red pine, and 81 and 13 for Norway spruce, respectively. Nitrogen and P retranslocation from current foliage ranged from 81 and 72%, respectively, for European larch, whereas red pine retranslocated the smallest amount of N (13%) and Norway spruce retranslocated the smallest amount of P (18%). In three evergreen species, uptake accounted for 72 to 74% of annual N requirement whereas for two deciduous species retranslocation accounted for 76 to 77% of the annual N requirement. Nitrogen and P use (ANPP/uptake) was more efficient in deciduous species than evergreen species. The results from this common garden experiment demonstrate that differences in N and P cycling among species may result from intrinsic characteristics (e.g. leaf longevity) rather than environmental conditions.
41490487|Stream discharge-concentration relationships are indicators of terrestrial ecosystem function. Throughout the Amazon and Cerrado regions of Brazil rapid changes in land use and land cover may be altering these hydrochemical relationships. The current analysis focuses on factors controlling the discharge-calcium (Ca) concentration relationship since previous research in these regions has demonstrated both positive and negative slopes in linear log 10 discharge-log 1 0 Ca concentration regressions. The objective of the current study was to evaluate factors controlling stream discharge-Ca concentration relationships including year, season, stream order,vegetation cover, land use, and soil classification. It was hypothesized that land use and soil class are the most critical attributes controlling discharge-Ca concentration relationships. A multilevel, linear regression approach was utilized with data from 28 streams throughout Brazil. These streams come from three distinct regions and varied broadly in watershed size (< 1 to > 10 6 ha) and discharge (10 -10. m s). Linear regressions of log 10 Ca versus log 10 discharge in 13 streams have a preponderance of negative slopes with only two streams having significant positive slopes. An ANOVA decomposition suggests the effect of discharge on Ca concentration is large but variable. Vegetation cover, which incorporates aspects of land use, explains the largest proportion of the variance in the effect of discharge on Ca followed by season and year. In contrast, stream order, land use, and soil class explain most of the variation in stream Ca concentration. In the current data set, soil class, which is related to lithology, has an important effect on Ca concentration but land use, likely through its effect on runoff concentration and hydrology, has a greater effect on discharge-concentration relationships.
1468935|A set of long term <sup>15</sup>N studies was initiated during the summers of 1981 and 1982 on the backslope and footslope, respectively, of a catena in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Microplots labeled with <sup>15</sup>N urea were sampled for <sup>15</sup>N and total N content in 1981 and 1982 and again in 1992. In November, 1982, 100% of the added N was recovered in the soil-plant system of the finer-textured footslope, compared to 39% in the coarser-textured backslope microplots. Ten years later, <sup>15</sup>N recovery of the applied N decreased at both topographic positions to 85% in the footslope and 29% in the backslope. Average losses since the time of application were 3.5 g N m<sup>-2</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup> in the backslope and 0.8 g N m<sup>-2</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup> in the footslope. In 1992, soil organic matter was physically fractionated into particulate (POM) and mineral associated (MAON) fractions and 21-day mineralization incubations were conducted to assess the relative amounts of <sup>15</sup>N that were in the slow, passive and active soil organic matter pools, respectively, of the two soils. Our findings confirm the assumptions that POM represents a large portion of the slow organic compartment and that the MAON represents a large fraction of the passive compartment defined in the Century model. The N located in the MAON had the lowest availability for plant uptake. Isotopic data were consistent with textural effects and with the Century model compartmentalization of soil organic N based on the residence time of the organic N.
1469383| Soil microorganisms and plants produce enzymes that mineralize organically bound nutrients. When nutrient availability is low, the biota may be able to increase production of these enzymes to enhance the supply of inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Regulation of enzyme production may be a point where N and P cycles interact. We measured acid phosphatase and chitinase (N-acetyl -D-glucosaminide) activity in soil across a chronosequence in Hawaii where N and P availability varies substantially among sites and long term fertilizer plots had been maintained for over 4 years. Phosphatase activity was high at all sites. Chitinase activity decreased significantly as age and N availability increased across the chronosequence. Phosphorus addition suppressed phosphatase activity at all sites, while N addition increased phosphatase activity at the young, N-limited site. In contrast, N addition repressed chitinase activity only at the N limited young site, and P additions had no effect on chitinase activity. These results suggest that the regulatory relationship between nutrient supply and nutrient mineralization are asymmetric for N and P, and that the differences could help to explain differences observed in patterns of N and P availability. 
1469413|The variability and biological fractionation of Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca and <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios were studied in a soil-plant-invertebrate-bird food chain in two forested ecosystems with contrasting calcium availability in the northeastern U.S.A. Chemical measurements were made of the soil exchange pool, leaves, caterpillars, snails, and both the femurs and eggshells of breeding insectivorous migratory songbirds. <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr values were transferred up the food chain from the soil exchange pool to leaves, caterpillars, snails and eggshells without modification. Adult birds were the one exception; their <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr values generally reflected those of lower trophic levels at each site, but were lower and more variable, probably because their strontium was derived in part from foods in tropical winter habitats where lower <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios are likely to predominate. Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios decreased at each successive trophic level, supporting previous suggestions that Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios can be used to identify the trophic level at which an organism is primarily feeding. The changes in Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios we measured for vegetation and insects were comparable to similar measurements made previously (but based on single samples of each organism) in an alpine ecosystem. Changes in Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios between birds and their food have not previously been measured, but the values we obtained were similar to those for herbivorous and carnivorous mammals at similar trophic levels. Our results provide evidence that supports the use of Sr/Ca ratios in the determination of human paleodiets and suggests that Sr/Ca ratios may also provide a useful tool in studies of modern food webs. Furthermore, our findings suggest that <sup>90</sup>Sr from nuclear fallout will not bioaccumulate in forests and that changes in Sr/Ca ratios between trophic levels will need to be considered in some cases when using <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr as a tracer of calcium biogeochemistry.
40343625|Organic and inorganic carbon concentrations in lakes and the links to catchment and water quality were studied in variable landscapes using the Finnish Lake Survey data base including 874 randomly selected lakes sampled during autumn overturn. The median total organic carbon (TOC) in these boreal lakes was 7.8 mg 1, the median total inorganic carbon (TIC) 1.6 mg  and the median partial pressure of CO (pCO) 900 atm. When the data was divided into subgroups according to land use in the catchment, the proportion of TIC of the total carbon (TC) in lakes was highest (31%) in agricultural areas and lowest (10%) in peatland areas. Elevated TIC concentrations were associated with agricultural land in the catchment, whereas elevated TOC concentrations were observed in lakes with high peatland proportion in the catchment. Two contrasting important sources of CO in lakes were identified on the basis of statistical analysis of the data; weathering processes in the catchments and decomposition of organic matter. CO was also strongly associated with total nutrients TN and TP, implying the importance of quality of organic matter and availability of nutrients for the decomposition processes.
40980878|Pulses of plant-available nutrients to the soil solution are expected to occur during the dynamic winter-spring transition in arctic tundra. Our aims were to quantify the magnitude of these potential nutrient pulses, to understand the sensitivity of these pulses to winter conditions, and to characterize and integrate the environmental and biogeochemical dynamics of this period. To test the hypotheses that snow depth, temperature and soil water and not snow nutrient content are important controls on winter and spring biogeochemistry, we sampled soil from under ambient and deepened snow every 3 days from late winter to spring, in addition to the snowpack at the start of thaw. Soil and microbial biogeochemical dynamics were divided into distinct phases that correlated with steps in soil temperature and soil water. Soil solution and microbial pools of C, N and P fluctuated with strong peaks and declines throughout the thaw, especially under deepened snow. Snowpack nutrient accumulation was negligible relative to these biogeochemical peaks. All nutrient and microbial peaks declined simultaneously at the end of snowmelt and so this decline was delayed by 15 days under deepened snow. The timing of these nutrient pulses is critical for plant species nutrient availability and landscape nutrient budgets. This detailed and statistically-based characterisation of the winter-spring transition in terms of environmental and biogeochemical variables should provide a useful foundation for future biogeochemical process-based studies of thaw, and indicate that spring thaw and possibly growing season biogeochemical dynamics are sensitive to present and future variability in winter snow depth.
41490548|Methanogenic archaea are ubiquitous in peat soils; however, their diversity and distributions within and among peatland ecosystems are not well known. We used comprehensive clone libraries of 16S rRNA gene sequences to investigate spatial patterns in diversity (richness, evenness of taxa) and composition (taxonomic, phylogenetic) of the methanogenic community in six peatlands arrayed 775 km from eastern Ontario, Canada to West Virginia, USA. Five sites were Sphagnum (moss) and shrub dominated; one site was sedge dominated; and, potential rates of methane (CH) production ranged from 15 to 450 nmol/g day. The gradient allowed us to examine influences of site conditions, site history, and climate on community composition. The region had representatives of methanogens from four taxonomic orders. We observed 29 operationally defined units (OTUs) based on >97% sequence identity. One OTU accounted for 43% of all clones, whereas 15 OTUs were rare with <1% of the total number of clones. The number of OTUs per site ranged from 4 to 21, and statistical analysis suggested diversity of 443 per site. Eighteen of the OTUs were endemic to one site; albeit, most endemics occurred in the sedge dominated site. One OTU was cosmopolitan, occurring in all six sites. We found a positive relationship between methanogen diversity and rates of CH production per site (Pearson r = 0.93). Turnover in community composition between sites was weakly related to geographic distance between sites, whereas variation in soil pH and annual temperature played larger roles. About 50% of the variation in community composition was unexplained by distance, pH, mean climate, and site age. We conclude that methanogen diversity in peatlands of the central Appalachian region is shaped by present-day environmental conditions, suggesting an influence of impending climatic and environmental changes.
1468856|Samples of 01/02, A1, E2 and Bh horizons collected from a coastal pine forest were assayed for the potential capacity to adsorb and to form organic sulfur from added sulfate. The subsequent mobilization (mineralization) of organic S was also assayed to determine potential capacities of the samples for organic S accumulation. Organic and inorganic forms of S were quantified, as were total carbon and nitrogen levels. Relationships between these parameters and the above S processing capacities for each sample were examined, and fluctuations were statistically analyzed. Of the organic S present, sulfonate-S (non-Raney Ni-reducible S) was found to be the major component irrespective of horizon. Adsorbed and soluble S were found to be low, suggesting that loss by leaching may be an important fate of incoming sulfate at this site. Results from this study were compared with those obtained for two additional sites, which have been examined in detail and documented previously to be S accumulating. Soils from the pine forest site adsorbed substantially less sulfate than those from the other two sites. The organic S accumulation capacity was relatively low for the pine site, averaging less than one third of the potential established for the other two sites.
1468902| The concentrations of methanethiol (MSH) and 3-mercaptopropionate (3-MPA) increased for a period of up to 24 h in fresh slurries of anoxic Biscayne Bay sediments. Other endogenous thiols such as glutathione (GSH) deceased immediately after slurry preparation or were not detectable at all. The maximum concentrations reached by 3-MPA and MSH were sometimes as high as 1 M, but were usually in the 100 to 300 nM range. After the initial increases, the concentrations of these thiols decreased rapidly to nearly constant levels of 20 nM for MSH and < 1nM for 3-MPA. In pre-incubated slurries, which had constant levels of thiols, the addition of microbial inhibitors including tungstate, molybdate, chloroform, and a mixture of chloramphenicol plus tetracycline caused MSH and 3-MPA to accumulate steadily. In the presence of inhibitors, accumulation rates of MSH ranged from 18 to 730 nM d<sup>-1</sup> and those of 3-MPA ranged from 0 to 185 nM d<sup>-1</sup>. Tungstate and chloroform generally gave the highest accumulation rates, while molybdate gave the lowest, possibly due to its complexation with sulfhydryl compounds. BES (2-Bromoethanesulfonate) was also tested for its effects, but no 3-MPA and only trace amounts (19 nM d<sup>-1</sup>) of MSH accumulated with this treatment. However, additions of BES (10 mM) to sulfidic sediments caused significant ( 8  M d<sup>-1</sup>) production of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (HS-CoM). Formation of HS-CoM was abiotic and was due to sulfide attack on the bromine atom in BES. The accumulations of 3-MPA and MSH in the presence of several different microbial inhibitors, suggests that these thiols may turn over in anoxic sediments. The relatively low concentrations of thiols observed in pore water profiles may be due to continuous microbial removal of these compounds. Much larger amounts of thiols were associated with sediment particles than present in the pore water. Evidence is presented which suggests that bound thiols may be exchangeable with the porewater, and therefore potentially available for microbial consumption. 
1469595|We used a chronosequence comprised of 10 y, 52 y and 142 y old 'a' a lava flows on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, to determine the accumulation of organic matter and nitrogen and rates of nitrogen fixation through time. The mass of organic matter (live and dead biomass and soil organic matter) on the 1984, 1942 and 1852 lava flows was 0.6, 2.2 and 7.6 kg m-2, respectively, while total N was 4.8, 10.9 and 85.7 g m-2. We estimated the total rates of nitrogen fixation for the three different aged ecosystems using an acetylene reduction assay calibrated with 15N incubations. While mean rates of total N fixation remained largely constant across the three sites -- between 2.0 and 3.1 kg ha-1 y-1 -- the most important sources of N fixation changed. On the 10 y flow, the most important fixer was the pioneering cyanolichen, Stereocaulon vulcani. After 52 years of ecosystem development, the most important N fixer was a cyanoalga, while after 142 years, the predominant N fixers were heterotrophic bacteria associated with leaf litter, twigs and detritus. The total amount of N accumulated after 52 years of ecosystem development was equivalent to cumulative inputs through biological N fixation. After 142 years, however, cumulative inputs from N fixation could only account for between 27-59% of the total nitrogen accrued. We used fertilizer additions of all essential nutrients other than N to test whether the availability of lithophilic nutrients regulated rates of N fixation in early ecosystem development. Rates of nitrogen fixation by the lichen, S. vulcani, approximately doubled when fertilized on the 1984 and 1942 flows. Rates of N-fixation by heterotrophic nitrogen fixing bacteria on leaf litter of Metrosideros polymorpha also increased significantly when fertilized with lithophilic nutrients. These findings suggest that weathering rates of lava in part regulate rates of nitrogen fixation in these young ecosystems.
41490472|We used two dataseis of C analyses of archived soil samples to study carbon turnover in O horizons from spruce dominated old-growth stands on well-drained podzols in Scandinavia. The main data set was obtained from archived samples from the National Forest Soil Inventory in Sweden and represents a climatic gradient in temperature. Composite samples from 1966, 1972, 1983 and 2000 from four different regions in a latitude gradient ranging from 57 to 67N were analysed for C content. Along this gradient the C stock in the O horizon ranges from 2.1 kg m in the north to 3.7 kg m in the southwest. The other data set contains C analyses from 1986, 1987, 1991, 1996 and 2004 from the O horizons in Birkenes, Norway. Mean residence times (MRT) were calculated using a two compartment model, with a litter decomposition compartment using mass loss data from the literature for the three-first years of decomposition and a humus decomposition compartment with a fitted constant turnover rate. We hypothesized that the climatic gradient would result in different C turnover in different parts of the country between northern and southern Sweden. The use of archived soil samples was very valuable for constraining the MRT calculations, which showed that there were differences between the regions. Longest MRT was found in the northernmost region (41 years), with decreasing residence times through the middle (36 years) and central Sweden (28 years), then again increasing in the southwestern region (40 years). The size of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in the horizon was mainly related to differences in litter input and to a lesser degree to MRT. Because N deposition leads both to larger litter input and to longer MRT, we suggest that N deposition contributes significantly to the latitudinal SOC gradient in Scandinavia, with approximately twice as much SOC in the O horizon in the south compared to the north. The data from Birkenes was in good agreement with the Swedish dataset with MRT estimated to 34 years.
1468663|The seasonal flux of methane to the atmosphere was measured at three salt marsh sites along a tidal creek. Average soil salinities at the sites ranged from 5 to 17 ppt and fluxes ranged from below detection limits (less than 0.3 mgCH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) to 259 mgCH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Annual flux to the atmosphere was 5.6 gCH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> from the most saline site, 22.4 gCH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> from the intermediate site, and 18.2 gCH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> from the freshest of the three sites. Regression of the amount of methane in the soil with flux indicates that changes in this soil methane can account for 64% of the observed variation in flux. Data on pore water distributions of sulfate suggests that the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria is a primary control on methane flux in these transitional environments. Results indicate that relatively high emissions of methane from salt marshes can occur at soil salinities up to approximately 13 ppt. When these data are combined with other tidal marsh studies, annual CH<sub>4</sub> flux to the atmosphere shows a strong negative correlation with the long term average soil salinity over a range from essentially fresh water to 26 ppt.
1469685| The surface water of the marine environment has traditionally been viewed as a nitrogen (N) limited habitat, and this has guided the development of conceptual biogeochemical models focusing largely on the reservoir of nitrate as the critical source of N to sustain primary productivity. However, selected groups of Bacteria, including cyanobacteria, and Archaea can utilize dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) as an alternative N source. In the marine environment, these microorganisms can have profound effects on net community production processes and can impact the coupling of C-N-P cycles as well as the net oceanic sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. As one component of an integrated 'Nitrogen Transport and Transformations' project, we have begun to re-assess our understanding of (1) the biotic sources and rates of N<sub>2</sub> fixation in the world's oceans, (2) the major controls on rates of oceanic N<sub>2</sub> fixation, (3) the significance of this N<sub>2</sub> fixation for the global carbon cycle and (4) the role of human activities in the alteration of oceanic N<sub>2</sub> fixation. Preliminary results indicate that rates of N<sub>2</sub> fixation, especially in subtropical and tropical open ocean habitats, have a major role in the global marine N budget. Iron (Fe) bioavailability appears to be an important control and is, therefore, critical in extrapolation to global rates of N<sub>2</sub> fixation. Anthropogenic perturbations may alter N<sub>2</sub> fixation in coastal environments through habitat destruction and eutrophication, and open ocean N<sub>2</sub> fixation may be enhanced by warming and increased stratification of the upper water column. Global anthropogenic and climatic changes may also affect N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates, for example by altering dust inputs (i.e. Fe) or by expansion of subtropical boundaries. Some recent estimates of global ocean N<sub>2</sub> fixation are in the range of 100-200 Tg N (1-2  10<sup>14</sup> g N) yr<sup>-1</sup>, but have large uncertainties. These estimates are nearly an order of magnitude greater than historical, pre-1980 estimates, but approach modern estimates of oceanic denitrification. 
1469317|The biogeochemistry of Hg was evaluated in a small wetland in the Adirondack region of New York. Concentrations of total Hg (Hg<sub>T</sub>) in streamwater draining the wetland showed little temporal variation. The annual areal watershed flux of Hg<sub>T</sub> (2.2  g/m<sup>2</sup>-yr) was considerably smaller than regional inputs of atmospheric deposition of Hg<sub>T</sub> indicating that the terrestrial environment is a net sink for atmospheric deposition of Hg<sub>T</sub>. Drainage inputs of Hg<sub>T</sub> were conservatively transported through the beaver impoundment. The annual flux of total methylmercury (CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sub>T</sub><sup>+</sup>) was greater than literature values of atmospheric deposition suggesting that the watershed is a net source of CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sub>T</sub><sup>+</sup>. Stream concentrations of CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sub>T</sub><sup>+</sup> increased during low-flow summer conditions in a riparian wetland, and particularly at the outlet of the beaver impoundment. Net production of CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sub>T</sub><sup>+</sup> occurred in the beaver impoundment (0.45  g/m<sup>2</sup>-yr). Rates of net methylation for the beaver impoundment were comparable to values reported in the literature for wetlands.
1468982|Denitrification was directly estimated in estuarine sediments of Waquoit Bay, Cape Cod, MA by detection of N<sub>2</sub> increases above ambient in the water overlying sediment cores. Denitrification rates (-9 to 712  mol N<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) were high compared to previous studies, but compared well with estimates of N loss from mass balance studies. The precision of the estimate depended on the N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> flux ratio. The N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> flux ratio was lower in Waquoit Bay than previously studied estuaries, and estuaries had lower N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> flux ratios than shelf sites. The contribution of temperature-driven solubility changes to estuarine fluxes was estimated by modeling sediment temperature variations and found to be potentially important (43  mol N<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>); however, control incubations indicate the temperature model overestimates solubility driven fluxes. The relatively low fluxes under anaerobic conditions and the low rate of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> removal from the overlying water indicates coupled nitrification/denitrification produced the observed N<sub>2</sub> fluxes.
1469894|Sulfur cycling was investigated in carbonate-rich and iron-poor sediments vegetated with Posidonia oceanica in oligotrophic Mediterranean around Mallorca Island, Spain, to quantify sulfate reduction and pools of sulfide in seagrass sediments. The oxygen penetration depth was low (< 4.5 mm) and sulfate reduction rates were relatively high (0.7-12 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). The total pools of reduced sulfides were remarkably low (< 5 mol S m<sup>-2</sup>) indicating a fast turnover of reduced sulfides in these iron-poor sediments. The sulfate reduction rates were generally higher in vegetated compared to bare sediments possible due to enhanced sedimentation of sestonic material inside the seagrass meadows. The sulfate reduction rates were positively correlated with the seasonal variation in water temperature and negatively correlated with the shoot density indicating that the microbial activity was controlled by temperature and release of oxygen from the roots. The pools of reduced sulfides were low in these iron-poor sediments leading to high oxygen consumption for reoxidation. The sediments were highly anoxic as shown by relatively low oxygen penetration depths (< 4.5 mm) in these low organic sediments. The net shoot recruitment rate was negative in sediments enriched with organic matter, suggesting that organic matter enrichment may be an important factor for seagrass status in these iron-depleted carbonate sediments.
20456471|The effects of iron limitation on photoacclimation to a dynamic light regime were studied in Phaeocystis antarctica. Batch cultures were grown under a sinusoidal light regime, mimicking vertical mixing, under both iron-sufficient and -limiting conditions. Iron-replete cells responded to changes in light intensity by rapid xanthophyll cycling. Maximum irradiance coincided with maximum ratios of diatoxanthin/diadinoxanthin (dt/dd). The maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis (<tex-math>$F_{v}/F_{m}$</tex-math>) was negatively related to both irradiance and dt/dd. Full recovery of <tex-math>$F_{v}/F_{m}$</tex-math> by the end of the light period suggested successful photoacclimation. Iron-limited cells displayed characteristics of high light acclimation. The ratio of xanthophyll pigments to chlorophyll a was three times higher compared to iron-replete cells. Down-regulation of photosynthetic activity was moderated. It is argued that under iron limitation cells maintain a permanent state of high energy quenching to avoid photoinhibition during exposure to high irradiance. Iron-limited cells could maintain a high growth potential due to an increased absorption capacity as recorded by in vivo absorption, which balanced a decrease in <tex-math>$F_{v}/F_{m}$</tex-math>. The increase in the chlorophyll a-specific absorption cross section was related to an increase in carotenoid pigments and a reduction in the package effect. These experiments show that P. antarctica can acclimate successfully to conditions as they prevail in the Antarctic ocean, which may explain the success of this species.
40980882|Cyanobacteria and green algae present in biological soil crusts are able to colonize mineral substrates even under extreme environmental conditions. As pioneer organisms, they play a key role during the first phases of habitat colonization. A characteristic crust was sampled 3 years after installation of the artificial water catchment "Chicken creek", thus representing an early successional stage of ecosystem development. Mean annual rainfall and temperature were 559 mm and 9.3C, respectively. We combined scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX) and infrared (FOR) microscopy to study the contact zone of algal and cyanobacterial mucilage with soil minerals in an undisturbed biological soil crust and in the subjacent sandy substrate. The crust was characterized by an approximately 50 m thick surface layer, where microorganisms resided and where mineral deposition was trapped, and by an approximately 2.5 mm thick lower crust where mineral particles were stabilized by organo-mineral structures. SEM/EDX microscopy was used to determine the spatial distribution of elements, organic compounds and minerals were identified using FTIR microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The concentration of organic carbon in the crust was about twice as much as in the parent material. Depletion of Fe, Al and Mn in the lower crust and in the subjacent 5 mm compared to the geological substrate was observed. This could be interpreted as the initial phase of podzolization. Existence of bridging structures between mineral particles of the lower crust, containing phyllosilicates, Fe compounds and organic matter (OM), may indicate the formation of organomineral associations. pH decreased from 8.1 in the original substrate to 5.1 on the crust surface 3 years after construction, pointing to rapid weathering of carbonates. Weathering of silicates could not be detected.
40980877|Re-examination of data distributions from several forested sites in the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains shows consistent, positive outliers and skew for NH , NO, and mineral N in resin lysimeters and resin capsules, indicating that most values were low but hotspots of high N flux were present in most cases. Exact causes of these N flux hotspots is not known, but could include water flux hotspots (e. g., preferential flowpaths), microbial hotspots, and possibly the entry of N-enriched horizon interflow. Soil and resin stake (PRS probe) data from one site (North Lake Tahoe) also showed consistent, positive outliers and skew for NH , NO, and mineral N, suggesting the presence of microbially produced hotspots. Bicarbonate-P data from soils and ortho-P data from PRS probes also showed highly positive skew and extreme outliers, but Bray (HCI/NHF-extractable) P in soils did not. Other measured nutrients (extractable Mg , K , SO, and Ca) also showed positive skew and outliers, but less so than NH , NO, and mineral N. Calcium stood out among measured nutrients as the most abundant nutrient with the least outliers and the lowest (sometimes negative) skew. The differences in distributions of NH , NO, and mineral N and those of Ca may reflect relative abundance: the most abundant ion, Ca , shows little evidence of hotspots whereas the much less abundant ions, NH , NO consistently show evidence of hotspots. We hypothesize that the differing distributions of N and Ca reflect the relative biological competition for these nutrients and that positively-skewed distributions and hotspots will be characteristic of any other nutrient when it is in limited supply relative to biological demand.
1469000|The Godavari River, the third largest river of India, has been sampled for Particulate Inorganic and Organic Carbon (PIC, POC), Particulate Nitrogen (PN), and Particulate Amino Acids (PAA, including 2 hexosamines (HA)). During the dry season Particulate Organic Matter (POM) in the upper reaches is relatively fresh and autochthonous, in the lower reaches it is degraded and inorganic suspended matter content is higher here. In the wet season (wet monsoon) heavy rains cause a basin-wide flushing of humus from entire catchment area consequently POM in the river is mainly degraded and allochthonous. Annual transport of the Godavari River amounts to 2.81 10<sup>6</sup> ton POC, 0.29 10<sup>6</sup> ton PN and 0.10 10<sup>6</sup> ton Particulate Amino Acid Nitrogen. These amounts rank the Godavari River to one of the most important organic carbon transporting rivers in the world.
20456502|Based on the data from China's second national soil survey and field observations in northwest China, we estimated soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in China and investigated its spatial and vertical distribution. China's SOC storage in a depth of 1 meter was estimated as 69.1 Pg (10 g), with an average density of 7.8 kg m. About 48% of the storage was concentrated in the top 30 cm. The SOC density decreased from the southeast to the northwest, and increased from arid to semi-humid zone in northern China and from tropical to cold-temperate zone in the eastern part of the country. The vertical distribution of SOC differed in various climatic zones and biomes; SOC distributed deeper in arid climate and water-limited biomes than in humid climate. An analysis of general linear model suggested that climate, vegetation, and soil texture significantly influenced spatial pattern of SOC, explaining 78.2% of the total variance, and that climate and vegetation interpreted 78.9% of the total variance in the vertical SOC distribution.
1469564|The area of wet grasslands on peat soil in the Netherlands is slowly increasing at the expense of drained, agriculturally used grasslands. This study aimed (i) to assess the contribution of wet grasslands on peat soil to methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions, and (ii) to explain differences among sites and between years in order to improve our understanding of controlling factors. For these purposes, a field study was conducted in the period 1994-1996 in the nature preserve "Nieuwkoopse Plassen", which is a former peat mining and agricultural area. Net CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were measured weekly to monthly with vented closed flux chambers at three representative sites, and at ditches near these sites. Three-years average of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions was 7.9 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for Drie Berken Zudde, 13.3 for Koole, and 20.4 for Brampjesgat. Ditches near the sites emitted 4.2-22.5 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The time-course of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions for all experimental sites and years was fit with a multiple linear regression model with ground water level and soil temperature as independent variables. Lowering or raising the ground water level by 5 cm could decrease or increase CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by 30-50%. Therefore, ground water level management of these grasslands should be done with care.
1469033|Phosphorus mineralization is chemically coupled with organic matter (OM) decomposition in surface horizons of a mixed-conifer forest soil from the Sierra Nevada, California, and is also affected by the disturbance caused by forest harvesting. Solution <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of NaOH extracts revealed a decrease of O-alkyl and alkyl-C fractions with increasing degree of decomposition and depth in the soil profile, while carbonyl and aromatic C increased. Solid-state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR analysis of whole soil samples showed similar trends, except that alkyl C increased with depth. Solution <sup>31</sup>P-NMR indicated that inorganic P (P<sub>i</sub>) increased with increasing depth, while organic-P (P<sub>o</sub>) fractions decreased. Close relationships between P mineralization and litter decomposition were suggested by correlations between P<sub>i</sub> and C fractions (r = 0.82, 0.81, -0.87, and -0.76 for carbonyl, aromatic, alkyl and O-alkyl fractions, respectively). Correlations for diester-P and pyrophosphate with O-alkyl (r = 0.63 and 0.84) and inverse correlations with aromatics (r = -0.74 and -0.72) suggest that mineralization of these P fractions coincides with availability of C substrate. A correlation between monoester P and alkyl C (r = 0.63) suggests mineralization is linked to breakdown of structural components of the plant litter. NMR analyses, combined with Hedley-P fractionation, suggest that post-harvest buildup of labile P in decomposed litter increases the potential for leaching of P during the first post-harvest season, but also indicates reduced biological activity that transports P from litter to the mineral soil. Thus, P is temporarily stored in decomposed litter, preventing its fixation by mineral oxides. In the mineral horizons, <sup>31</sup>P-NMR provides evidence of decline in biologically-available P during the first post-harvest season.
20456479|Chemical defence is a potential mechanism contributing to the success of Phaeocystis species that repeatedly dominate the phytoplankton in coastal areas. Species within the genus Phaeocystis have long been suspected of imposing negative effects on co-occurring organisms. Recently a number of toxins have been extracted and identified from Phaeocystis samples, but it is not clear if they do enhance the competitive advantage of Phaeocystis species. In the present study the cytotoxic impact of live Phaeocystis pouchetii to human blood cells in close proximity, regardless of the nature of the responsible mechanism, was quantified using a bioassay. Haemolytic activity was measured during blooms of P. pouchetii in mesocosms. These environments were chosen to mimic natural conditions including chemically mediated interactions that could trigger defensive and/or allelopathic responses of Phaeocystis. Haemolytic activity correlated with P. pouchetii numbers and was absent during the preceding diatom bloom. Samples containing live P. pouchetii cells showed the highest activity, while filtered sea water and cell extracts were less haemolytic or without effect. Dose-response curves were linear up to 70% lysis, and haemolysis in samples containing live P. pouchetii cells reached EC values comparable to known toxic prymnesiophytes (1.9 * 10 cells l). Haemolytic activity was enhanced by increased temperature and light. The results indicate that unprotected and thus presumably vulnerable cells present in a P. pouchetii bloom may lyse within days.
1469884|Groundwater discharge rates were estimated from borehole groundwater temperature and pore water temperature under the seabed to be 0.92-3.6 cm/day in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia. Automated and manual seepage meters measured larger groundwater discharge rates of 13.7-16.3 cm/day. This difference may be because the observed seepage rates measured by seepage meters include not only terrestrial fresh groundwater discharge but also recirculated salt water. On the other hand, the discharge rates estimated from subsurface temperature may consist of only terrestrial fresh groundwater discharge.
1469559|Precipitation, dry deposition, and cloud water deposition of fixed nitrogen (nitrate and ammonium ions) were measured on the Island of Hawaii. The first two were small N inputs, averaging 0.6 0.2 and 0.15 0.08 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> respectively. We estimate cloud water deposition to be 8-22 kg inorganic N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. If an estimate of organic N is included, it may be as high as 50 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, cloud water deposition is of hydrological significance as it comprised 37% of the total water input. Cloud water interception was certainly lower in the past, as the developing ecosystem would have had less collection surface area. Cloud water samples that were associated with volcanic haze events were very concentrated in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and constituted 60% of the annual cloud water N deposition. This NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> probably originated from atmospheric N fixed thermally at the hot lava surface or from an interaction between lava and the ocean. If volcanically influenced samples are excluded from the analysis, the resulting cloud water deposition would have been 4-9 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The Pacific Ocean and Kilauea volcano may have a profound impact on the development of this terrestrial ecosystem, as sources of fixed nitrogen.
24715120|Benthic-pelagic exchange processes are recognised as important nutrient sources in coastal areas, however, the relative impact of diffusion, resuspension and other processes such as bioturbation and bioirrigation are still relatively poorly understood. Experimental ship-based data are presented showing the effects of diffusion and resuspension on cohesive sediments at a temperate shelf location in the North Sea. Measurements of diffusive fluxes in both spring (1.76, 0.51, 0.91, 17.6 mol/m/h) and late summer (8.53, 0.03, 1.12, 35.0 mol/m/h) for nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and dissolved silicon respectively, provided comparisons for measured resuspension fluxes. Increases in diffusive fluxes of nitrate and dissolved silicon to the water column in late summer coincided with decreases in bottom water oxygen concentrations and increases in temperature. Resuspension experiments using a ship board annular flume and intact box core allowed simulataneous measurement of suspended particulate matter, water velocity and sampling of nutrients in the water column during a step wise increase in bed shear velocity. The resuspension of benthic fluff led to small but significant releases of phosphate and nitrate to the water column with chamber concentration increasing from 0.700.76 and 1.842.22 mol/L respectively. Resuspension of the sediment bed increased water column concentrations of dissolved silicon by as much as 125% (7.1015.9 mol/L) and nitrate and phosphate concentrations by up to 67% (1.843.08 mol/L) and 66% (0.701.15 mol/L) respectively. Mass balance calculations indicate that processes such as microbial activity or adsorption/desorption other than simple release of pore water nutrients must occur during resuspension to account for the increase. This study shows that resuspension is potentially an important pathway for resupplying the water column with nutrients before and during phytoplankton blooms and should therefore be considered along with diffusive fluxes in future ecosystem models.
41490458|Measurements of near-sea-level tropospheric CO have been made at Wellington, New Zealand since December 1954; these measurements comprise the longest such record available. The C rose from 10 in 1955 peaking at 695 in 1965 as a result of "bomb C" production, before falling thereafter to the present day (2005) value of 73. The peak occurred about 1 year later in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere. The post-1965 fall is due to the transfer of C-enriched CO to the biospheric and oceanic pools together with ongoing release of C-free CO from fossil fuel combustion, during an era without major atmospheric nuclear-weapon tests. Time series analysis of the data using Loess decomposition and filtering indicates an approximately exponential decline in excess C over 1967-2005 with an e-folding time of 18 years. The seasonal cycle from 1954 until 1980 had a maximum in the late (austral) summer, a minimum in winter, with peak-to-trough amplitude that peaked at 20 in 1966. For the period 1980-1989, a new seasonal cycle emerged, with a maximum in winter and a minimum in late summer/early autumn and peak-to-trough amplitude of 3.5, transitioning to a new seasonal structure after about 1990.
20456559|There is considerable interest in how ecosystems will respond to changes in precipitation. Alterations in rain and snowfall are expected to influence the spatio-temporal patterns of plant and soil processes that are controlled by soil moisture, and potentially, the amount of carbon (C) exchanged between the atmosphere and ecosystems. Because grasslands cover over one third of the terrestrial landscape, understanding controls on grassland C processes will be important to forecast how changes in precipitation regimes will influence the global C cycle. In this study we examined how irrigation affects carbon dioxide (CO) fluxes in five widely variable grasslands of Yellowstone National Park during a year of approximately average growing season precipitation. We irrigated plots every 2 weeks with 25% of the monthly 30-year average of precipitation resulting in plots receiving approximately 150% of the usual growing season water in the form of rain and supplemented irrigation. Ecosystem CO fluxes were measured with a closed chamber-system once a month from May-September on irrigated and unirrigated plots in each grassland. Soil moisture was closely associated with CO fluxes and shoot biomass, and was between 1.6% and 11.5% higher at the irrigated plots (values from wettest to driest grassland) during times of measurements. When examining the effect of irrigation throughout the growing season (May-September) across sites, we found that water additions increased ecosystem CO fluxes at the two driest and the wettest sites, suggesting that these sites were water-limited during the climatically average precipitation conditions of the 2005 growing season. In contrast, no consistent responses to irrigation were detected at the two sites with intermediate soil moisture. Thus, the ecosystem CO fluxes at those sites were not water-limited, when considering their responses to supplemental water throughout the whole season. In contrast, when we explored how the effect of irrigation varied temporally, we found that irrigation increased ecosystem CO fluxes at all the sites late in the growing season (September). The spatial differences in the response of ecosystem CO fluxes to irrigation likely can be explained by site specific differences in soil and vegetation properties. The temporal effects likely were due to delayed plant senescence that promoted plant and soil activity later into the year. Our results suggest that in Yellowstone National Park, above-normal amounts of soil moisture will only stimulate CO fluxes across a portion of the ecosystem. Thus, depending on the topographic location, grassland CO fluxes can be water-limited or not. Such information is important to accurately predict how changes in precipitation/soil moisture will affect CO dynamics and how they may feed back to the global C cycle.
4151458|The contribution of throughfall and stemflow as pathways for solute inputs into the forest floor in four mature forests in northwest Amazonia was investigated. Total solute inputs, resulting from the changes of atmospheric deposition after rainfall passes through the forest canopy, are presented in the form of throughfall and stemflow nutrient inputs and their possible sources are discussed. Throughfall is by far the most important solute input into the forest floor of the forests studied. On average, it represents about 98% of the total solute inputs. Although trends in solute enrichment varied among the forests, there is a general tendency in all ecosystems towards a distinct enrichment of SO
1469897| Organically bound phosphorus (P) is a mobile form of phosphorus in many soils and thus its dynamics relevant for the leaching and cycling of this element. Despite its importance, little is known about the chemical composition of dissolved organic P. We studied the concentrations, fluxes, and chemical composition of organic P in forest floor leachates and soil solutions in a Rendzic Leptosol under a 90-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest over a 27-month period (1997-1999). The chemical composition of organic P was analysed using XAD-8 fractionation and <sup>31</sup>P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Organic P was the dominant P form in forest floor leachates as well as in porewaters of the mineral soil. The largest concentrations of organic P were observed during summer and peaked (330-400 g dissolved organic P l<sup>-1</sup>) after rain storms following short dry periods, concurrently with the concentrations of organic carbon (OC). Because of high rainfall, fluxes of organic P (and C) were greatest in autumn although concentrations of organic C and P were lower than in summer. In forest floor leachates, the hydrophilic fraction of dissolved organic matter contained 83  13% of the bulk organic P. In soil solutions from 90 cm depth, organic P was almost exclusively in the hydrophilic fraction. Because of the low retention of the hydrophilic fraction of dissolved organic matter in the mineral soils, concentrations of organic P in soil water remained almost constant with depth. Consequently, organic P contributed > 95% of the total P leached into deeper subsoils. The overall retention of organic P in the weakly developed mineral soils was little and so the average annual fluxes of organic P in subsoils at 90 cm depth (38 mg m<sup>-2</sup>) comprised 67% of those from the forest floors (57 mg m<sup>-2</sup>) during the study period. Hence, organic P proved to be mobile in the studied soil. <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectroscopy confirmed the dominance of organic P species in soil water. Signals due to inorganic P occurred only in spectra of samples collected in winter and spring months. Spectra of samples from summer and autumn revealed traces of condensed phosphates. Due to low P contents, identification of organic P species in samples from winter and spring was not always possible. In summer and autumn, monoester and diester phosphates were the dominant organic species and varied little in their relative distributions. The distribution of organic species changed little from forest floor leachates to the subsoil solutions indicating that the composition of P-containing compounds was not influenced by sorptive interactions or biological transformation. 
24715128|Trophodynamics of meso-zooplankton in the North Sea (NS) were assessed at a site in the southern NS, and at a shallow and a deep site in the central NS. Offshore and neritic species from different ecological niches, including Calanus spp., Temora spp. and Sagitta spp., were collected during seven cruises over 14 months from 2007 to 2008. Bulk stable isotope (SI) analysis, phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) compositions, and CPLFA data of mesozooplankton and particulate organic matter (POM) were used to describe changes in zooplankton relative trophic positions (RTPs) and trophodynamics. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the RTPs of zooplankton in the North Sea vary spatially and seasonally, in response to hydrographic variability, with the microbial food web playing an important role at times. Zooplankton RTPs tended to be higher during winter and lower during the phytoplankton bloom in spring. RTPs were highest for predators such as Sagitta sp. and Calanus helgolandicus and lowest for small copepods such as Pseudocalanus elongatus and zoea larvae (Brachyura). NPOM-based RTPs were only moderate surrogates for animals' ecological niches, because of the plasticity in source materials from the herbivorous and the microbial loop food web. Common (16:0) and essential (eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid, DHA) structural lipids showed relatively constant abundances. This could be explained by incorporation of PLFAs with C signatures which followed seasonal changes in bulk CPOM and PLFA CPOM signatures. This study highlighted the complementarity of three biogeochemical approaches for trophodynamic studies and substantiated conceptual views of size-based food web analysis, in which small individuals of large species may be functionally equivalent to large individuals of small species. Seasonal and spatial variability was also important in altering the relative importance of the herbivorous and microbial food webs.
1468736|Biogeochemical prospecting for mercury deposits and deposits of other minerals by the chemical analysis of mercury in plants or plant tissue that accumulate this element in linear (or near linear) proportion to the concentration in the soil is an effective method of exploration, even where allochthonous material as much as 200 to 2000 m thick covers the deposits. Plant tissues with this tendency to accumulate mercury (designated as non-barrier to mercury) comprise only a small fraction of the total of 255 types of plant tissues that were tested. Ten of these were considered to be quantitatively informative, and their mercury concentrations exceeded background values 300 or more times. The remaining types of plant tissues ranged in prospecting value from semi-quantitatively informative to qualitatively informative to uniformative (mercury values at or below background). The failure of some earlier uses of this prospecting method is attributed to the use of inappropriate plant tissues, to the mercury in the particular substrate studied existing in a form of low mobility and availability to plants, or to both causes. Prospecting by examining mercury concentrations in soils and rocks (lithogeochemical prospecting) is more effective than the biogeochemical approach only in prospecting for cinnabar deposits having no allochthonous cover. Mercury-biogeochemical prospecting is most effective for non-mercury mineral deposits and for oil and gas deposits. The types of plant tissues used in these studies are listed and are classified according to their value in prospecting. A case history is given of the Ozernoe pyrite-polymetallic deposit in Siberia.
1469168|A synthesis of the biogeochemistry of K was conducted during 1963-1992 in the reference and human-manipulated watershed-ecosystems of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH. Results showed that during the first two years of the study (1963-65), which coincided with a drought period, the reference watershed was a net sink for atmospheric inputs of K. During the remaining years, this watershed has been a net source of K for downstream ecosystems. There have been long-term declines in volume-weighted concentration and flux of K at the HBEF; however, this pattern appears to be controlled by the relatively large inputs during the initial drought years. Net ecosystem loss (atmospheric deposition minus stream outflow) showed an increasing trend of net loss, peaking during the mid-1970s and declining thereafter. This pattern of net K loss coincides with trends in the drainage efflux of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, indicating that concentrations of strong acid anions may be important controls of dissolved K loss from the site. There were no long-term trends in streamwater concentration or flux of K. A distinct pattern in pools and fluxes of K was evident based on biotic controls in the upper ecosystem strata (canopy, boles, forest floor) and abiotic controls in lower strata of the ecosystem (mineral soil, glacial till). This biological control was manifested through higher concentrations and fluxes of K in vegetation, aboveground litter, throughfall and forest floor pools and soil water in the northern hardwood vegetation within the lower reaches of the watershed-ecosystem, when compared with patterns in the high-elevation spruce-fir zone. Abiotic control mechanisms were evident through longitudinal variations in soil cation exchange capacity (related to soil organic matter) and soil/till depth, and temporal and disturbance-related variations in inputs of strong-acid anions. Marked differences in the K cycle were evident at the HBEF for the periods 1964-69 and 1987-92. These changes included decreases in biomass storage, net mineralization and throughfall fluxes and increased resorption in the latter period. These patterns seem to reflect an ecosystem response to decreasing rates of biomass accretion during the study. Clearcutting disturbance resulted in large losses of K in stream water and from the removal of harvest products. Stream losses occur from release from slash, decomposition of soil organic matter and displacement from cation exchange sites. Elevated concentrations of K persist in stream water for many years after clearcutting. Of the major elements, K shows the slowest recovery from clearcutting disturbance.
20519789|The forms, rotational patterns and trends of hysteretic loops of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO) were investigated in three headwater Mediterranean streams during one autumn-winter period using two biogeochemical descriptors summarizing the changes in solute concentrations (C) and the overall dynamics of each hysteretic loop (R). The study had two aims: (1) to examine whether the variability of solute hysteretic loops monitored in different streams during cold seasons followed a consistent and recurring pattern, (2) to identify hydrological parameters which could potentially influence features of the DOC and NO hysteresis. Relationships between hysteresis features and hydrological parameters in the studied streams were explored using multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA). Both DOC and NO typically increased in concentration during storm events, although hysteretic loops did not obey any consistent pattern across the three streams. The rotational patterns of DOC and NO hysteresis ranged widely, from clockwise to counterclockwise. Storm hydrographs and also the magnitude of antecedent storm events were explanatory of the DOC and NO concentration changes across the study sites. However, the detailed hydrological information did not offer a satisfactory explanation of the entire DOC and NO concentration dynamics during the storm events.
23359759|Dissolved and particulate organic matter (POM) of three Quebec boreal reservoirs of different ages (Laforge-1, 7 years; Robert-Bourassa, 25 years and Cabonga, 70 years at the time of sampling) and sets of lakes from the same watersheds was analyzed using organic carbon concentrations, C/N and C/P elemental composition,  13 C and  15 N isotopic values. The reservoirs are characterized by lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations with lower C/N ratios and by lower  13 C and higher  15 N in POM. They contain more autochthonous dissolved organic matter and less terrigenous organic matter than the lakes. Some of those characteristics are more pronounced in the younger than in the older reservoirs. The differences can be attributed to two causes: (1) more extended degradation of terrigenous organic matter, caused by an increase in residence time; and (2) differences in food web structure resulting from the phenomenon known as trophic upsurge, in newly flooded reservoirs. The results indicate that some effects of reservoir creation on the carbon cycle are short term perturbations, others however long term features of those reservoirs. The implications of these findings for CO 2 emissions from reservoirs are discussed.
1469441|This field manipulation study tested the effect of weekly pulses of solutions of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> salts on the evolution of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O from peatland soils. Methane and nitrous oxide emission from a nutrient-poor fen in northern Minnesota USA was measured over a full growing season from plots receiving weekly additions of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> or (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. At this relatively pristine site, natural additions of N and S in precipitation occur at 8 and 5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Nine weekly additions of the dissolved salts were made to increase this to a total deposition of 31 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> on the NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>-amended plots and 30 and 29 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> of N and S, respectively, in the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-amended plots. Methane flux was measured weekly from treatment and control plots and all data comparisons are made on plots measured on the same day. After the onset of the treatments, and over the course of the growing season, CH<sub>4</sub> emission from the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-amended plots averaged 163 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, significantly lower than the same-day control plot mean of 259 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> (repeated measures ANOVA). Total CH<sub>4</sub> flux from (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> treatment plots was one third lower than from control plots, at 11.7 and 17.1 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Methane emission from the NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>-amended plots (mean of 256 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) was not significantly different from that of controls measured on the same day (mean of 225 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). Total CH<sub>4</sub> flux from NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> treatment plots and same-day controls was 16.9 and 15.1 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. In general, stable, relatively warm and wet periods followed by environmental 'triggers' such as rainfall or changes in water table or atmospheric pressure, which produced a CH<sub>4</sub> 'pulse' in the other plots, produced no observable peak in CH<sub>4</sub> emission from the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-amended plots. Nitrous oxide emission from all of the plots was below the detection limit over the course of the experiment.
1469778|Here, we investigate the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil organic nitrogen (SON) to cultivation within two different climatic regimes by comparing large soil data sets from India and the Great Plains. Multiple regression models for both regions show that SOC and SON, as well as C/N ratios, increase with decreasing temperatures and increasing precipitation, trends also noted in soil data organized by Holdridge life zones. The calculated difference between natural and cultivated soils in India revealed that the greatest absolute SOC and SON losses occurred in regions of low temperatures and high precipitation, while the C/N ratio decreased during cultivation only with decreasing temperature. In India, the fractional loss of SOC relative to undisturbed soils increases with decreasing temperature whereas, in the Great Plains, it increases with increasing precipitation. Also, the fractional loss of SOC increased in India with increasing amounts of original C, whereas no relationship between fractional loss and original C was noted for the Great Plains. The differential response of each region to cultivation is hypothesized to be due to differences in both climate and management practices (crop cycles, fertilization). These findings suggest that estimates of soil C loss due to cultivation should be based on an array of factors, and that it is unlikely that a constant relative C loss occurs in any region.
23359707|We investigated the regulatory effect of salinity on the production of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and methanethiol (MeSH) in estuarine sediments and the potential interactions with the nitrous oxide (N 2 O) reductase step of the denitrification pathway. This was achieved by monitoring DMS, MeSH and N 2 O accumulation in sediment slurries retrieved from a temperate estuary (Ave, NW Portugal). Treatments were performed with and without amendments of potential sulfur gas precursors, DMSP (050 M) or methionine (0500 M) at different salinities (0, 15 and 30 ppt). Experimental increases of salinity inhibited DMS accumulation under both oxic and anoxic incubation conditions, and the pattern was observed whether DMSP or methionine was added or not, i.e. lower salinities stimulated DMS net production. In contrast, MeSH tended to accumulate to higher concentrations in higher salinity treatments (15 and 30 ppt). Our results also suggest that while salinity had a direct influence on N 2 O accumulation, it also may modulated N 2 O production through its regulatory effect on the formation of MeSH, a compound previously shown to inhibit N 2 O reduction activity. Overall, our results suggest that changes in salinity may have an important regulatory role in net production of DMS, MeSH and N 2 O and their potential emissions to the atmosphere.
1469872|UV irradiation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the laboratory can produce small, labile organic compounds utilizable by microbes, but few studies have attempted to document this process in situ. <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to examine the bulk chemical composition of natural and laboratory-irradiated high-molecular-weight DOC (HMW-DOC) from shaded (150  mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> average light in surface water) and open (1500  mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) field sites over one and a half years. <sup>13</sup>C NMR revealed only small differences in carbon functional groups between laboratory irradiated and non-irradiated HMW-DOC. However, bacterial protein productivity per cell (BPP) was enhanced in naturally irradiated samples of HMW-DOC in a field mesocosm experiment (p < 0.05), suggesting that bacterial growth was enhanced by photochemical production of labile DOC substrates. Absorbance characteristics such as spectral slope, absorbance at 350 nm, and the absorbance ratio 250 nm/365 nm revealed that HMW-DOC was photoreactive, yet no differences in these values were found between samples irradiated with and without UV-B. In experiments conducted with simulated solar radiation in the laboratory and with natural light in the field mesocosm experiment, UV-A (320-400 nm) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm) were more effective than UV-B (280-320 nm) in HMW-DOC photolysis.
20055290|A set of three relatively pristine seasonally inundated limesink wetlands and one riparian wetland was studied over a 4-6 month long inundation period in 2001. Patterns in organic matter properties and oxygen consumption in the water column followed a previously documented ecological gradient based on soil composition, vegetation type, and canopy cover. The full canopy, cypress-gum swamp had the highest mean concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 26.2 mg/l) and dissolved lignin (sum 6; 299 g/l) with lower concentrations observed in the partial canopy, cypress savanna (22.0 mg/l DOC; 252 g/l sum 6) and the open marsh savanna (20.6 mg/l DOC; 135 g/l sum 6), respectively. During the inundation period, DOC increased in concentration, dissolved lignin decreased, and
1469014|A quantitative understanding of the factors controlling the variation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in headwater streams is of scientific concern for at least two reasons. First, quantifying the overall carbon budgets of lotic systems is needed for a fundamental understanding of these systems. Second, DOC interacts strongly with other dissolved substances (heavy metals in particular) and plays an important role in the transport of contaminants. In the Snake River near Montezuma, Colorado, measurements of DOC from 1980 to 1986 show rapid decreases in concentration from a peak very early in the snowmelt period. Peak DOC concentrations occur approximately one month prior to peak discharge in the stream. The decline in DOC with time is approximately exponential, suggesting that a simple flushing mechanism can explain the response. We examined hydrological mechanisms to explain the observed variability of DOC in the Snake River by simulating the hydrological response of the catchment using TOPMODEL and routing the predicted flows through a simple model that accounted for temporal changes in DOC. Conceptually the DOC model represents a terrestrial (soil) reservoir in which DOC builds up during low flow periods and is flushed out by infiltrating meltwaters. The model reproduces the main features of the observed variation in DOC in the Snake River and thus lays the foundation for quantitatively linking hydrological processes with carbon cycling through upland catchments. Model results imply that a significant fraction of the soils in the Snake River catchment contribute DOC to the stream during peak discharge. Our work represents one of the first attempts to quantitatively describe the hydrological controls on DOC dynamics in a headwater stream. These controls are studied through the model by imposing mass balance constraints on both the flux of water through the various DOC source areas and the amount of DOC that can accumulate in these areas.
41490495|Over two hundred samples were collected in tropical headwater forested catchments in the lowland Amazon basin near Juruena, Mato Grosso Brazil. These were analyzed for fluorescence characteristics and DOC concentrations, and represented a range of terrestrial hydrologic flowpaths and first-order streams during baseflow and stormflow conditions. The fluorescence index (FI) of McKnight et al. (2001) was found to have a significant relationship with DOC concentrations for stream water at baseflow conditions, but FI values within individual terrestrial flowpaths and stormflow varied little for the range of DOC concentrations observed. FI values were seen to increase for increasing residence time of water within the terrestrial ecosystem, while DOC concentration decreased for increasing hydrologie residence time. The FI of terrestrial flow paths indicated that DOC became increasingly characterized by microbially derived carbon for flow paths with longer residence times, on the order through fall and overland flow < percolating soil water < groundwater. Base flow samples of stream water had a mean FI value of 1.78, compared with 1.51 and 1.44 for through fall and overland flow, respectively, and 1.65 for percolating soil water. The FI values for stream water at base flow were also seen to vary seasonally, and were inversely proportional to DOC concentrations over time.
1469179|Streamflow-related variability in nutrient flux represents an important source of uncertainty in managing nutrient inputs to coastal ecosystems. Quantification of flux variability is of particular interest to coastal resource managers in adopting effective nutrient-reduction goals and monitoring progress towards these goals. We used historical records of streamflow and water-quality measurements for 104 river monitoring stations in an analysis of variability in annual and seasonal flux of nitrate to the Atlantic coastal zone. We present two measures of temporal flux variability: the coefficient of variation (CV) and the exceedence probability (EP) of 1.5 times the median flux. The magnitude of flux variations spans a very wide range and depends importantly upon the season of year and the climatic and land-use characteristics of the tributary watersheds. Year-to-year variations (CV) in annual mean flux range over two orders of magnitude, from 3-200% of the long-term mean flux, although variations more typically range from 20-40% of the long-term mean. The annual probability of exceeding the long-term median flux by more than 50% (EP) is less than 0.10 in most rivers, but is between 0.10 and 0.35 in 40% of the rivers. Year-to-year variability in seasonal mean flux commonly exceeds that in annual flux by a factor of 1.5 to 4. In western Gulf of Mexico coastal rivers, the year-to-year variablity in the seasonal mean flux is larger than in other regions, and is of a similar magnitude in all seasons. By contrast, in Atlantic coastal rivers, the winter and spring seasons, which account for about 70% of the annual flux, display the smallest relative variability in seasonal mean flux. We quantify the elasticity of nutrient flux to hypothetical changes in streamflow (i.e., the percent increase in flux per percentage increase in mean discharge) to allow the approximation of flux variability from streamflow records and the estimation of the effects of future climatically-induced changes in streamflow on nutrient flux. Flux elasticities are less than unity (median = 0.93%) at most stations, but vary widely from 0.05% to 1.59%. Elasticities above unity occur most frequently in the largest rivers and in rivers draining the arid portions of the western Gulf of Mexico Basin. Historical flux variability and elasticity generally increase with the extent of arid conditions and the quantity of nonurban land use in the watershed. We extend the analysis of flux variability to examine several case studies of highly unusual meteorological events capable of significantly elevating nitrate flux and degrading estuarine ecology.
20456558|Urban streams often contain elevated concentrations of nitrogen (N) which can be amplified in systems receiving effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In this study, we evaluated the importance of denitrification in a stream draining urban Greensboro, NC, USA, using two approaches: (1) natural abundance of
41490556|Globally, hypoxic areas (<63 mmol O m) in coastal waters are increasing in number and spatial extent. One of the largest coastal hypoxic regions has been observed during the summer in the bottom-water of the Louisiana continental shelf. The shelf receives the sediments, organic matter, and nutrients exported from the Mississippi River watershed, and much of this material is ultimately deposited to the sea floor. Hence, quantifying the rates of sediment-water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), oxygen (O), and nutrient fluxes is important for understanding how these processes relate to the development and maintenance of hypoxia. In this study, the sediment-water fluxes of DIC, O, nutrients, and N (denitrification) were measured on the Louisiana shelf during six cruises from 2005 to 2007. On each cruise, three to four sites were occupied in or directly adjacent to the region of the shelf that experiences hypoxia. DIC fluxes, a proxy for total sediment respiration, ranged from 7.9 to 21.4 mmol m day but did not vary significantly either spatially or as a function of bottom-water O concentration. Overall, sediment respiration and nutrient flux rates were small in comparison to water-column respiration and phytoplankton nutrient demand. Nitrate fluxes were correlated with bottomwater O concentrations (r = 0.69), and there was evidence that decreasing O concentrations inhibited coupled nitrification-denitrification. Denitrification rates averaged 1.4 mmol N m day. Scaled to the area of the shelf, the denitrification sink represented approximately 39% of the N load from the Mississippi River watershed. The sediment-water fluxes reported from this study add substantial information on the spatial and temporal patterns in carbon, O, and nutrient cycling available for the Louisiana continental shelf and, thus, improve the understanding of this system.
1469364| In a preliminary experiment we found that methane evolved from a sandy subsoil during aerobic incubation of shaken soil slurries. In the study presented here the methane was found to be released from the sand particles by mechanical weathering, caused by the grinding effect of the shaking. Large amounts of gas (about 0.5 ml gas g<sup>-1</sup> soil) were extracted by intense grinding of the soil in gas tight serum vials. Methane was the main hydrocarbon in the emitted gas, but also a considerable amount of ethane was present, as well as minor amounts of heavier hydrocarbons (up to C<sub>6</sub>). The  <sup>13</sup>C-values of the emitted methane and ethane were -33 and -29, respectively. Together these results demonstrate a thermogenic origin of the gas. This paper also reports the results of an incubation experiment where possible methane oxidation was looked for. If a possible release of methane is not accounted for, methane oxidation may be overlooked, as illustrated in this paper. Methane consumption was detected only in soil from 40 cm, in contrast to soil sampled at 100 cm and deeper where a slight production was measured. When methane oxidation was inhibited by dimethyl-ether, a significant release of methane was seen. The release was probably caused by chemical weathering. When this methane release was taken into account, methane oxidation was found to be present at all measured depths (40 to 200 cm). Fertilization with urea inhibited the methane oxidation at 40 cm but not at deeper layers. It is hypothesized that ammonia oxidizing bacteria were the main methane oxidizers in this mineral subsoil (deeper than 1 m), and that oxidation of methane might be a survival mechanism for ammonia oxidizers in ammonia limited environments. 
20519809|We conducted a series of experiments whereby dissolved organic matter (DOM) was leached from various wetland and estuarine plants, namely sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), spikerush (Eleocharis cellulosa), red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), cattail (Typha domingensis), periphyton (dry and wet mat), and a seagrass (turtle grass; Thalassia testudinum). All are abundant in the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) except for cattail, but this species has a potential to proliferate in this environment. Senescent plant samples were immersed into ultrapure water with and without addition of 0.1% NaN (w/ and w/o NaN, respectively) for 36 days. We replaced the water every 3 days. The amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), sugars, and phenols in the leachates were analyzed. The contribution of plant leachates to the ultrafiltered high molecular weight fraction of DOM (&gt; 1 kDa; UDOM) in natural waters in the FCE was also investigated. UDOM in plant leachates was obtained by tangential flow ultrafiltration and its carbon and phenolic compound compositions were analyzed using solid state C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (C CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy and thermochemolysis in the presence of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH thermochemolysis), respectively. The maximum yield of DOC leached from plants over the 36-day incubations ranged from 13.0 to 55.2 g C kg dry weight. This amount was lower in w/o NaN treatments (more DOC was consumed by microbes than produced) except for periphyton. During the first 2 weeks of the 5 week incubation period, 60-85% of the total amount of DOC was leached, and exponential decay models fit the leaching rates except for periphyton w/o NaN. Leached DOC (w/ NaN) contained different concentrations of sugars and phenols depending on the plant types (1.09-7.22 and 0.38-12.4 g C kg dry weight, respectively), and those biomolecules comprised 8-34% and 4-28% of the total DOC, respectively. This result shows that polyphenols that readily leach from senescent plants can be an important source of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) in wetland environments. The O-alkyl C was found to be the major C form (55  9%) of UDOM in plant leachates as determined by C CPMAS NMR. The relative abundance of alkyl C and carbonyl C was consistently lower in plant-leached UDOM than that in natural water UDOM in the FCE, which suggests that these constituents increase in relative abundance during diagenetic processing. TMAH thermochemolysis analysis revealed that the phenolic composition was different among the UDOM leached from different plants, and was expected to serve as a source indicator of UDOM in natural water. Polyphenols are, however, very reactive and photosensitive in aquatic environments, and thus may loose their plant-specific molecular characteristics shortly. Our study suggests that variations in vegetative cover across a wetland landscape will affect the quantity and quality of DOM leached into the water, and such differences in DOM characteristics may affect other biogeochemical processes.
24715139|We evaluated changes in the chemistry of the uppermost soil horizons in an unmanaged spruce forest (National Park Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic) for 3 years after dieback caused by a bark beetle infestation, and compared these changes with a similar undisturbed forest area. The soils below the disturbed forest received 26 times more elements via litter fall compared to the unaffected plot. The subsequent decomposition of litter and reduced nutrient uptake by trees resulted in a steep increase in soil concentrations of soluble N (NH-N, organic-bound N) and P forms in the disturbed plot. The average concentrations of NH-N and soluble reactive P increased from 0.8 to 4.4 mmol kg and from 0.04 to 0.9 mmol kg, respectively, in the uppermost soil horizon. Decomposition of litter at the disturbed plot elevated soil concentrations of Ca, Mg and K, which replaced Al and H ions from the soil sorption complex. Consequently, soil concentrations of exchangeable base cations increased from 120 to 200 meq kg, while exchangeable Al and H decreased 66 and 50 %, respectively, and soil base saturation increased from 40 to 70 %. The Al liberation did not elevate concentrations of ionic Al in the soil solution, because most of the liberated Al was rapidly complexed by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and transformed to DOC-Al complexes. The chemical parameters investigated at the unaffected plot remained stable during the study.
40343618|Phosphorus (P) dynamics in the agriculturally-dominated Minnesota River (USA) were examined in the lower 40 mile reach in relation to hydrology, loading sources, suspended sediment, and chlorophyll to identify potential biotic and abiotic controls over concentrations of soluble P and the recycling potential of particulate P during transport to the Upper Mississippi River. Within this reach, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) contributions as soluble reactive P (SRP) were greatest during very low discharge and declined with increasing discharge and nonpoint source P loading. Concentrations of SRP declined during low discharge in conjunction with increases in chlorophyll, suggesting biotic transformation to particulate P via phytoplankton uptake. During higher discharge periods, SRP was constant at ~ 0.115 mg 1 and coincided with an independently measured equilibrium P concentration (EPC) for suspended sediment in the river, suggesting abiotic control over SRP via phosphate buffering. Particulate P (PP) accounted for 66% of the annual total P load. Redox-sensitive PP, estimated using extraction procedures, represented 43% of the PP. Recycling potential of this load via diffusive sediment P flux under anoxic conditions was conservatively estimated as ~ 17 mg md using published regression equations. The reactive nature and high P recycling potential of suspended sediment loads in the Minnesota River has important consequences for eutrophication of the Upper Mississippi River.
40800612|We investigated several forms of phosphorus (P) in dryland soils to examine the chemical and textural controls on P stabilization on a diverse set of substrates. We examined three P fractions including labile, moderately labile, and occluded as determined by a modified Hedley fractionation technique. The P fractions were compared to texture measurements and total elemental concentrations determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Labile P related to the absence of materials involved in P Sorption. Moderately labile P was most strongly associated with high total Al & Fe content that we interpret to represent oxides and 1:1 clay minerals. The occluded P fraction was strongly associated with low total Al & Fe environments and interpreted to represent 2:1 clay minerals where ligand exchange tightly sequesters P. The results indicate that the controls on P fraction distribution are initially closely tied to the chemical and physical properties of the bedrock units that contribute to soil formation. Further, these results suggest that the progression of stabilized P forms in dryland areas differs from the progression observed in mesic environments. Soil development in dryland settings, such as the formation of pedogenic carbonates, may lead to differing controls on P availability and the proportional size of the moderately labile fraction. stabilized P forms in dryland areas differs from the progression observed in mesic environments. Soil development in dryland settings, such as the formation of pedogenic carbonates, may lead to differing controls on P availability and the proportional size of the moderately labile fraction.
41410590|Highly resolved time series data are useful to accurately identify the timing, rate, and magnitude of solute transport in streams during hydrologically dynamic periods such as snowmelt. We used in situ optical sensors for nitrate $(NO_3^ - )$ and chromophoric dissolved organic matter fluorescence (FDOM) to measure surface water concentrations at 30 min intervals over the snowmelt period (March 21-May 13,2009) at a 40.5 hectare forested watershed at Sleepers River, Vermont. We also collected discrete samples for laboratory absorbance and fluorescence as well as ${\delta ^{18}}O - NO_3^ - $ isotopes to help interpret the drivers of variable $NO_3^ - $ and FDOM concentrations measured in situ. In situ data revealed seasonal, event and diurnal patterns associated with hydrological and biogeochemical processes regulating stream $NO_3^ - $ and FDOM concentrations. An observed decrease in $NO_3^ - $ concentrations after peak snowmelt runoff and muted response to spring rainfall was consistent with the flushing of a limited supply of $NO_3^ - $ (mainly from nitrification) from source areas in surficial soils. Stream FDOM concentrations were coupled with flow throughout the study period, suggesting a strong hydrologic control on DOM concentrations in the stream. However, higher FDOM concentrations per unit streamflow after snowmelt likely reflected a greater hydraulic connectivity of the stream to leachable DOM sources in upland soils. We also observed diurnal $NO_3^ - $ variability of 1-2 mol l after snowpack ablation, presumably due to in-stream uptake prior to leafout. A comparison of $NO_3^ - $ and dissolved organic carbon yields (DOC, measured by FDOM proxy) calculated from weekly discrete samples and in situ data sub-sampled daily resulted in small to moderate differences over the entire study period (-4 to 1% for $NO_3^ - $ and -3 to -14% for DOC), but resulted in much larger differences for daily yields (-66 to + 27% for $NO_3^ - $ and -88 to + 47% for DOC, respectively). Despite challenges inherent in in situ sensor deployments in harsh seasonal conditions, these data provide important insights into processes controlling $NO_3^ - $ and FDOM in streams, and will be critical for evaluating the effects of climate change on snowmelt delivery to downstream ecosystems.
20055313|Arid ecosystems experience prolonged dry periods, as well as storms that vary in size, intensity and frequency. As a result, nitrogen (N) retention and export patterns may be a function of individual storm characteristics. Our objective was to determine how seasonal patterns in rainfall as well as individual storm characteristics influence N transport and retention on terrestrial hill slopes in a Sonoran Desert watershed. Regression models indicated that variation in runoff ammonium (NH) was best explained by antecedent conditions (cumulative seasonal rainfall, days since last storm) while variation in runoff nitrate (NO) was best explained by single storm characteristics, primarily rain NO. Increases in runoff NO along overland surface flowpaths were balanced by decreases in NH during summer, with no change in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration; a pattern consistent with nitrification. Nitrate increases along flowpaths were not as strong during winter storms. Results indicate that NH is transported from hillslopes to other parts of the catchment, including streams, and that nitrification occurs along surface flowpaths, particularly during summer storms. These findings suggest that the extent to which a receiving patch is supplied with NH or NO depends on the distance runoff has traveled (flowpath length) and the length of the antecedent dry period. The extent and configuration of fluvial reconnection amongst patches in the landscape following long drought periods likely determines the fate of available N, whether N is processed and retained in the terrestrial or in the aquatic component of the watershed, and the mechanisms involved. The nature of this fluvial reconnection is driven by the size, intensity and sequence of storms in space and time.
24715133|Plant-carbon inputs to soils in the form of dissolved sugars, organic acids and amino acids fuel much of heterotrophic microbial activity belowground. Initial residence times of these compounds in the soil solution are on the order of hours, with microbial uptake a primary removal mechanism. Through microbial biosynthesis, the dissolved compounds become dominant precursors for formation of stable soil organic carbon. How the chemical class (e.g. sugar) of a dissolved compound influences stabilization in field soils is unknown and predictions from our understanding of microbial metabolism, turnover and identity are contradictory. We show that soil carbon formation, from chronic amendments of dissolved compounds to fertilized and unfertilized grasslands, is 2.4-times greater from a sugar than an amino acid. Formation rates are negatively correlated with respiration rates of the compounds, and positively correlated with their recovery in microbial biomass. These relationships suggest that the efficiency of microbial growth on a compound is positively related to formation rates of soil organic carbon. Fertilization does not alter these findings, but together nitrogen and phosphorus additions reduce soil carbon formation. Our results highlight the need to consider both nutrient enrichment and global-change induced shifts in the form of dissolved root inputs to soils to predict future soil carbon stocks and hence phenomena such as climate warming and food security to which these stock sizes are intimately tied.
41490510|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) interaction with pesticides was examined studying the ability of DOM to desorb 8 pesticides previously sorbed to soil. DOM was originating from municipal waste composts at two maturity degrees, recovered at 20C and by hot-pressurised subcritical water. Pesticide desorption depended on their previous sorption on soil. When sorption was low (K oc  50, sulcotrione, metalaxyl), water was more efficient than DOM for desorption. On the contrary, when sorption was high (K oc  2000, trifluraline), little effect of DOM was observed. For the moderately sorbed pesticides, DOM favoured pesticide desorption compared to water. For the lowest sorbed pesticides (K oc  100), hysteresis was increased with larger proportions of DOM extracted with subcritical-water. Dissolved organic matter extracted from fresh-immature compost had larger capacity to mobilize the sorbed pesticides than the DOM from the mature compost. The pesticide desorption resulted from the positive and competitive interactions between pesticide, DOM and soil surfaces. These interactions were modelled considering separate partitioning coefficients. A general equation allowed the deduction of specific coefficients describing interactions in solution between pesticides and the non-sorbed fraction of DOM remaining in solution. This fraction was supposed to contain the most hydrophilic fraction of DOM and was able to interact with the most polar pesticide (amitrol). When pesticide hydrophobicity increased, the partitioning between pesticide and DOM decreased. Modelling the three-phase system (liquid, DOM and solid phases) pointed out that the solid phase played the most important role on pesticide behaviour through the sorption process of DOM and pesticide.
41490420|Results from chronosequences from the arctic to the tropics show that phosphorus (P) availability, total P, and the fraction of bedrockderived P remaining in soil diminishes as soils age. Thus we predict that ecosystems mantling old substrates are likely to have low available P. Yet there are myriad examples in the biogeochemical literature where the results from chronosequences are used to argue the reverse, and ecosystems observed to be P poor are assumed to mantle an old substrate. This premise is difficult to test, for while the concept of substrate age is useful on uneroded surfaces that formed at a particular time, it becomes obscured in denuding landscapes, where substrate ages instead reflect the rates of rock weathering, denudation and mixing of dust into soil. Here we explore this premise as it relates to one of the most ubiquitous assumptions in the biogeochemical literature: that the differences in nitrogen (N) and P cycling between temperate and tropical regions are driven by gradients in substrate age. We build a conceptual framework for quantify- ing the fraction of parent material P remaining in soil ([SoilP]/[RockP]), by estimating P inputs (rock weathering and dust deposition) and outputs (P leaching). We parameterize our model with spatially explicit (0.5) estimates of global denudation, weathering zone thickness, and P deposition. To test the assumption that latitudinal gradients in P status are the result of soil age, we apply a single P loss rate, derived from a humid tropical system in the Hawaiian Islands, to our spatially explicit map of soil residence times. Surprisingly, in this formulation, we find only a modest latitudinal gradient in soil P depletion, with mean depletion values in the humid tropics < 2x greater than in the previously unglaciated humid temperate zone. This small latitudinal gradient in P depletion is unlikely to be sufficient to drive the observed differences in tropical vs. temperate ecosystem stoichiometry (e. g. trends in foliar and litter N: P). Thus our results suggest that, to the extent P depletion is greater in the tropics, the appropriate conceptual model for attributing causation may not be one of a chronosequence where time is the primary driver of P loss. We hypothesize that the covariation of inferred P availability with latitude may be strongly controlled by latitudinal changes in rates of P leaching and occlusion, rather than gradients in substrate age.
23359758|Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) compounds is the major source of anthropogenic N to most upland ecosystems, where leaching of nitrate ( $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ ) into surface waters contributes to eutrophication and acidification as well as indicating an excess of N in the terrestrial catchment ecosystems. Natural abundance stable isotopes ratios, 15 N/ 14 N and 18 O/ 16 O (the "dual isotope" technique) have previously been used in biogeochemical studies of alpine and forested ecosystems to demonstrate that most of the $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ in upland surface waters has been microbially produced. Here we present an application of the technique to four moorland catchments in the British uplands including a comparison of lakes and their stream inflows at two sites. The $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ concentrations of bulk deposition and surface waters at three sites are very similar. While noting the constraints imposed by uncertainty in the precise  18 O value for microbial $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ , however, we estimate that 7998% of the annual mean $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ has been microbially produced. Direct leaching of atmospheric $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ is a minor component of catchment $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ export, although greater than in many similar studies in forested watersheds. A greater proportion of atmospheric $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ is seen in the two lake sites relative to their inflow streams, demonstrating the importance of direct $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ deposition to lake surfaces in catchments where terrestrial ecosystems intercept a large proportion of deposited N. The dominance of microbial sources of $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ in upland waters suggests that reduced and oxidised N deposition may have similar implications in terms of contributing to $\mathrm{N}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{-}$ leaching.
1468926| Direct measurements of gaseous ammonia in the atmosphere of a dry bat cave containing several million insectivorous bats revealed a peak concentration of 1779 ppm (0.96 mg/dm<sup>3</sup>). Observations indicate that the origin of the gaseous ammonia is rapid microbial decomposition of bat urea, not chitinous guano. Modelling of ammonia distribution and diffusion indicates that ammonia production at the Cueva del Tigre is  257 g NH<sub>3</sub>/day, equivalent to the decomposition of 454 g urea/day. Ammonia production is also characterized by significant isotopic fractionation favoring isotopically light ( <sup>15</sup>N depleted) ammonia. 
1468686|Tomales Bay, a graben structure along the San Andreas Fault, was selected for modeling ecosystem nutrient dynamics because of its linear, one-dimensional morphology and relatively pristine state. Groundwater is a potentially important term in the nutrient budget. The geologic complexities created by the San Anreas Fault, however, complicate the hydrogeology and require the area to be subdivided into three regions: granite to the west, Franciscan Formation to the east, and alluvial fill in the trough. Nutrient concentrations in the groundwater were determined through extensive well sampling; groundwater discharge was estimated using both Darcy's Law calculations and a soil moisture budget. Results indicate that groundwater discharge is of the same order of magnitude as summer streamflow into the Bay, while being significantly less than other freshwater inputs in winter. Dissolved nutrient (phosphate, nitrate + nitrite, ammonium, silica and DIC) concentrations in groundwater were consistently higher (by as much as an order of magnitude) than in surface water discharges. During the summer months, groundwater flow contributes about as much nutrient load to the bay as does streamflow. During the winter, the groundwater contribution to nutrient loading is about 20% of the streamflow contribution. Our findings indicate that groundwater is a significant component of terrestrial nutrient and freshwater loading to Tomales Bay, particularly so during the summer months. However, neither groundwater nor streamflow nutrient fluxes are large in comparison to the mixing flux at the bay mouth or the flux of N<sub>2</sub> gas across the air-water interface.
1469971|Reservoirs are sources of greenhouses gases to the atmosphere, primarily due to organic carbon mineralization in flooded plants and soils to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Floating peat islands are common in reservoirs that inundated peatlands. These islands can decompose on mass, or small pieces of peat can erode from islands to decompose in the water column or on the bottom of reservoirs. Here we used large 450 liter sealed enclosures to measure mineralization rates of small peat pieces and larger peat blocks collected from floating peat islands. Mineralization rates were calculated by quantifying dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> accumulation within the water and headspace of the enclosures over time. We found that peat did decompose under water, but rates of mineralization of peat pieces were not different than rates of mineralization of larger peat blocks. Mineralization rates ranged between 59 and 140  g C g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Peat pieces acidified the water, shifting the bicarbonate equilibrium to almost exclusively dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> which was then readily able to flux to the atmosphere. We estimated that 2.4-5.6% of peat carbon was mineralized annually, suggesting that fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> from reservoirs that flood peatlands could last at minimum 18-42 years from this carbon source alone.
1469944| Understanding the factors regulating the concentrations of basic cations in soils and surface waters is critical if rates of recovery are to be predicted in response to decreases in acidic deposition. Using a dynamic simulation model (PnET-BGC), we evaluated the extent to which atmospheric deposition of strong acids and associated leaching by strong anions, atmospheric deposition of basic cations through changes in emissions of particulate matter, and historical forest cutting have influenced soil pools of exchangeable basic cations and the acid-base status of stream water at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire. Historical deposition of basic cations was reconstructed from regression relationships with particulate matter emissions. Simulation results indicate that the combination of these factors has resulted in changes in the percent soil base saturation, and stream pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) from pre-industrial estimates of 20%, 6.3 and 45 eq L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, to current values of 10%, 5.0 and -5 eq L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These current values fall within the critical thresholds at which forest vegetation and aquatic biotic are at risk from soil and surface water acidification due to acidic deposition. While the deposition of strong acid anions had the largest impact on the acid-base status of soil and stream water, the reduction in deposition of basic cations associated with reductions in particulate emissions was estimated to have contributed about 27% of the depletion in soil Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange pool and 15% of the decreases in stream water concentrations of basic cations. Decline in stream water concentrations of basic cation occurred under both increasing and decreasing exchangeable pools, depending on the process controlling the acid base status of the ecosystem. Model calculations suggest that historical forest cutting has resulted in only slight decreases in soil pools of exchangeable basic cations, and has had a limited effect on stream ANC over the long-term. 
20519895|The effect of snow cover on surface-atmosphere exchanges of nitrogen oxides (nitrogen oxide (NO) + nitrogen dioxide (NO); note, here 'NO' is used as surrogate for a series of oxidized nitrogen gases that were detected by the used monitor in this analysis mode) was investigated at the high elevation, subalpine (3,340 m asl) Soddie site, at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. Vertical (NO + NO) concentration gradient measurements in interstitial air in the deep (up to 2.5 m) snowpack were conducted with an automated sampling and analysis system that allowed for continuous observations throughout the snow-covered season. These measurements revealed sustained, highly elevated (NO + NO) mixing ratios inside the snow. Nitrogen oxide concentrations were highest at the bottom of the snowpack, reaching levels of up to 15 ppbv during mid-winter. Decreasing mixing ratios with increasing distance from the soil-snow interface were indicative of an upwards flux of NO from the soil through the snowpack, and out of the snow into the atmosphere, and imply that biogeochemical processes in the subnival soil are the predominant NO source. Nitrogen dioxide reached maximum levels of 3 ppbv in the upper layers of the snowpack, i.e., 20-40 cm below the surface. This behavior suggests that a significant fraction of NO is converted to NO during its diffusive transport through the snowpack. Ozone showed the opposite behavior, with rapidly declining levels below the snow surface. The mirroring of vertical profiles of ozone and the NO/(NO + NO) ratio suggest that titration of ozone by NO in the snowpack contributes to the ozone reaction in the snow and to the ozone surface deposition flux. However, this surface efflux of (NO + NO) can only account for a minor fraction of ozone deposition flux over snow that has been reported at other mid-latitude sites. Neither (NO + NO) nor ozone levels in the interstitial air showed a clear dependence on incident solar irradiance, much in contrast to observations in polar snow. Comparisons with findings from polar snow studies reveal a much different (NO + NO) and ozone snow chemistry in this alpine environment. Snowpack concentration gradients and diffusion theory were applied to estimate an average, wintertime (NO + NO) flux of 0.005-0.008 nmol m s, which is of similar magnitude as reported (NO + NO) fluxes from polar snow. While fluxes are similar, there is strong evidence that processes controlling (NO + NO) fluxes in these environments are very different, as subnivial soil at Niwot Ridge appears to be the main source of the (NO + NO) efflux, whereas in polar snow (NO + NO) has been found to be primarily produced from photochemical de-nitrification of snow nitrate.
40800619|We directly measured the partial pressure of dissolved CO (pCO) in two humid subtropical rivers in coastal Texas, one highly urbanized (Buffalo Bayou) and one relatively undeveloped (Spring Creek), and analyzed carbon isotopic signatures (C and C) of riverine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to determine carbon sources sustaining river respiration. Both rivers were highly supersaturated with CO at all study sites and on all dates sampled from June 2007 to February 2009. Mean riverine pCO values are 3,052  1,364 and 4,702  1,980 atm for Buffalo Bayou and Spring Creek, respectively. Calculated CO emission fluxes per ha of water surface area from these rivers are intermediate between those in tropical and temperate rivers, indicating that globally, humid subtropical rivers may be a significant source of atmospheric CO. Carbon isotopic signatures revealed that CO supersaturation is supported by different carbon sources for the two rivers. In the relatively undeveloped river (Spring Creek), young terrestrial organic matter (OM) is the predominant C source fueling river heterotrophic respiration. In the highly urbanized river (Buffalo Bayou), the high concentration of riverine CO is additionally supported by dissolution of CaCO likely from pedogenic carbonate, and crushed limestone/dolomite and oyster shells imbedded in old roads in the watershed. Because urban sources of acidity can include HNO and HSO, whether the limestone/dolomite and shells used by humans act as a net sink or source of atmospheric CO needs further study.
1468939| We studied the export of inorganic carbon and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) from a Danish freshwater wetland. The wetland is situated in an agricultural catchment area and is recharged by groundwater enriched with nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) (1000 M). NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in recharging groundwater was reduced (57.5 mol NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) within a narrow zone of the wetland. Congruently, the annual efflux of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the sediment was 19.1 mol C m<sup>-2</sup> when estimated from monthly in situ measurements. In comparison the CO<sub>2</sub> efflux was 4.8 mol C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> further out in the wetland, where no NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction occurred. Annual exports of inorganic carbon in groundwater and surface water was 78.4 mol C m<sup>-2</sup> and 6.1 mol C m<sup>-2</sup> at the two sites, respectively. N<sub>2</sub>O efflux from the sedimenst was detectable on five out of twelve sampling dates and was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher in the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction zone (0.35-9.40  mol m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, range of monthly means) than in the zone without NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction (0.21-0.41  mol m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). No loss of dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O could be measured. Total annual export of N<sub>2</sub>O was not estimated. The reduction of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in groundwater was minor throughout the wetland and did not exceed 0.2 mol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>--</sup>) was reduced in groundwater (2.1 mol SO<sub>4</sub><sup>--</sup> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) in the zone without NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction. Although the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in our wetland can be reduced along several pathways our results strongly suggest that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> loading of freshwater wetlands disturb the carbon balance of such areas, resulting in an accelerated loss of inorganic carbon in gaseous and dissolved forms. 
1469863| In acid-sensitive watersheds of the northeastern US, decreases in SO<sub>2</sub> emissions and atmospheric deposition of sulfur have not been accompanied by marked changes in pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). To better understand this phenomenon, we investigated the long-term trends in soil solution (1984-1998) and stream water (1982-2000) chemistry along a natural soil catena at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. Significant declines in strong acid anion concentrations were accompanied by declines in base cation concentrations in soil solutions draining the Oa and Bs soil horizons at all elevations. The magnitude of change varied with position in the landscape. Recovery, as indicated by increasing ANC (mean 2.38 Eq L<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) and decreasing concentrations of inorganic monomeric Al (mean 1.03 mol L<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>), was confined to solutions draining the Bs horizon at mid-to-higher elevations. However, persistently low Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Al<sub>i</sub> ratios (<1) in Bs soil solutions at these sites may be evidence of continuing Al stress to trees. In Bs soil solution at a lower elevation site and in Oa soil solutions at all sites, declines in base cations (mean 3.71 Eq L<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) were either similar to or exceeded declines in strong acid anions (mean 3.25 Eq L<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) resulting in no change in ANC. Changes in the chemistry of stream water reflected changes in soil solutions, with the greatest improvement in ANC occurring at high elevation and the rate of increase decreasing with decreases in elevation. The pH of soil solutions and stream waters either declined or did not change significantly. Therefore pH-buffering processes, including hydrolysis of Al and possibly the deprotonation of organic acids, have prevented increases in drainage water pH despite considerable reductions in inputs of strong acids. 
23359750|Within the southeast Canada and northeast USA region, a peak in sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) concentration has been reported for some streams following periods of substantial catchment drying during the summer months (ON, Canada; VT, NH and NY, USA). However, it is currently unclear if a SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> response to seasonal drying is widespread across the broader region, or to what extent the level of response varies among catchments. In our study, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> response to seasonal drying was compared in 20 catchments from 11 locations across southeastern Canada (ON, QC and NS) and northeastern USA (NH, NY, VT, WV and ME). Using long-term monitoring data of stream discharge and chemistry, the number of days for each month of the dry season (# d) when discharge (Q) was below a threshold level (25th percentile; Q<sub>25</sub>) was calculated for each catchment to give a measure of 'seasonal dryness' (# d Q < Q<sub>25</sub>). A SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> response score (rs) was then calculated for each catchment based on linear regression analysis of # d Q < Q<sub>25</sub> versus either the annual SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration, or the residual of annual SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration as a function of time (year). The final rs values for each catchment provided an estimate of the proportion of variation in annual SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration which could be explained by seasonal drying (possible rs range = 01). Of the 20 catchments, 13 exhibited some level of a SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> response to seasonal drying (rs = 0.040.72) with an additional two catchments exhibiting a SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> response for one or more seasons. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> response scores were positively related to percent wetland area(w) (rs = 1.000  0.978e<sup>-0.054*w</sup>, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.44) and percent saturated area (sat) (rs = 0.481)  0.488e<sup>-0.101*sat</sup>, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.54) indicating that wetlands/saturated areas were an important driver of regional variation in the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> response to seasonal drying. Our results suggest that any shift towards drier summers as a result of climate change could impact SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> dynamics in a large number of catchments throughout the region.
40343741|Transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) compose an important pool of paniculate organic matter (POM) in aquatic systems. However, no studies of TEP contribution to C export to sediment exist for freshwaters. We quantify the contribution of TEP to C sinking fluxes in an oligotrophic reservoir (Quntar, Southern Spain) by monitoring TEP in the water column and TEP, particulate organic carbon (POC) and dry weight in sedimentation traps. TEP sinking fluxes ranged from 0.73 to 183.23 mg C m day and from 0.51 to 177.04 mg C m day at the surface and at the bottom layer, respectively. These values represent that, over an annual basis, 5.59 Ton TEP-C (over 61.32 Ton POC) are exported, on an average, from the water column to the sediment of Quentar reservoir. TEP concentrations (average = 48.0 g XG eq 1) were lower than the scarce data reported for freshwaters. No significant relationships between TEP and Chi a concentrations or BA were observed. Average value for daily sedimentation flux (6.63 g Dry Weight m day) in the study reservoir was higher than that documented for low productive natural aquatic ecosystems as a consequence of the high amount of allochthonous material input characterizing reservoirs. TEP contributed to C export to sediment with a value that range from 0.02 to 31 %. Our results show that even in man-made systems, which are predominantly controlled by allochthonous inputs, TEP may be relevant for explaining POM settling fluxes.
41490415|In Mediterranean regions, drought is one of the main factors shaping fluvial ecosystems. Droughts cause a shift from lotie to lentic conditions, triggering a gradual fragmentation of the longitudinal hydrological continuum, and a severe alteration of water chemical properties. However, within a biogeochemical perspective, little is known about how and to which extend droughts modify the chemical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM). In this study, the variability of DOM properties along a fragmented fluvial system is explored, during a summer severe drought, by means of (a) the ratio between dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations (DOC:DON); (b) DOC bioavailability (BDOC) and (c) DOM optical properties (SUVA index, fluorescence index, and excitationemission fluorescence matrices). DOM and water measurements were collected from isolated water parcels that became disconnected from the fluvial continuum at different times, and were compared with data obtained in the following autumn, when the fluvial continuum was re-established. Analysis of DOM chemical properties evidenced that these properties during drought clearly differed from those observed in autumn, but changes did not follow an arbitrary pattern. Thus, the sampling sites with lotie water bodies showed DOM properties similar to those observed in autumn reflecting the dominance of terrestrial inputs. But, once hydrological fragmentation occurred, there was a gradual increase in the contribution of autochthonous DOM as the time elapsed since the pools were established, and the geochemical conditions shifted from oxidized to reduced conditions. In consequence, the fragmentation of fluvial continuum generates a set of distinct biochemical hot spots (i.e., each water parcel), revealing that extreme drought greatly amplifies the qualitative heterogeneity of organic matter in a fluvial system.
1468582|An extensive network of bottle/funnel collectors was used to measure hydrologic, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> fluxes in rain events and in throughfall beneath the canopies of several high elevation forest stands in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park during 1989-1990. The throughfall fluxes were used as deposition surrogates to quantify trends in atmospheric inputs to sapling trees growing in forest gaps and to the mature forest canopy at the edge surrounding each gap. The paired gap/edge stands were located above (1940 m) and below (1720 m) the base of the clouds typically impacting this mountain. Total hydrologic and ion fluxes beneath the edge trees during the forest growing season exceeded fluxes beneath the adjacent gap saplings by nearly a factor of three (e.g. 230 vs 88 meq m<sup>-2</sup> for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) at both elevations. Water and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> fluxes were up to two times greater beneath the forest edge at the cloud-prone 1940 m site than at 1720 m (e.g. 230 vs 110 meq m<sup>-2</sup> for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>). However, throughfall NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> fluxes were about 30% higher at 1720 m (17 vs 13 meq m<sup>-2</sup>), because this lower site receives greater dry deposition of HNO<sub>3</sub> due to its ridgetop location and greater wind penetration. Estimates of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> deposition from cloud impaction were consistent with the net throughfall flux of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> (throughfall flux minus rain flux) at the 1940 m forest edge, but greatly exceeded the net throughfall flux at 1940 m gap, suggesting differences in ion concentrations in cloud droplets impacting on mature edge trees and young saplings in forest gaps.
20456401|Plants in nutrient poor environments are often characterized by high nutrient resorption resulting in poor litter quality and, consequently, slow decomposition. We used oligotrophic, P-limited herbaceous wetlands of northern Belize as a model system, on which to document and explain how changes in nutrient content along a salinity gradient affect decomposition rates of macrophytes. In 2001 we established a nutrient addition experiment (P, N, and N&P) in 15 marshes of a wide range of water conductivities (200-6000 S), dominated by Eleocharis spp. To determine what is more important for decomposition, the initial litter quality, or site differences, we used reciprocal litter placement and cellulose decomposition assay in a combined "site quality" and "litter quality" experiment. Our prediction of the positive effects of P-enrichment on decomposition rate due to both the quality of litter and the site was confirmed. The site effect was stronger than the litter quality although both were highly significant. Strong site quality effect was apparently the result of more active decomposer community in P-enriched plots as supported by finding of higher microbial biomass in litter decomposing there. The strong effect of site quality on decomposition was further confirmed by the cellulose assay. The cellulose decomposition was significantly slower at high salinity sites indicating lower decomposer microbial activity. Litter nutrient N and P content and nutrient ratios were well correlated with decomposition with the best fit found for log C/P. At C/P mass ratio of &gt;4000 decomposition processes were extremely slow. We hypothesize that in a long run, the increased decomposition will compensate the increase in primary production resulting from increased nutrient loading and there will be no differences in accumulation of organic material between the controls and nutrient enriched plots.
24715334|Soil carbon pools are an essential but poorly understood factor in heterotrophic soil respiration on forested landscapes. We hypothesized that the topographically regulated distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the dominant factor contributing to soil CO efflux. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring soil CO efflux and sampling particulate and dissolved substrates (both mobile DOC in soil solution and DOC potentially sorbed onto Fe and Al oxyhydroxides) in surface (freshly fallen leaves (FFL) and forest floor) and near-surface (A-horizon or top 10 cm of peat) soils along three hillslope transects (15, 25 and 35 slopes) that included upland (crest, shoulder, backslope, footslope, and toeslope) and wetland (periphery and central) topographic features during the snowfree season within a sugar maple forest. We observed that median snowfree season soil CO efflux ranged from <1 to >5 mol CO m s. Substrates in the near-surface mineral soil were most strongly related to median soil CO efflux, and when combined mobile DOC and sorbed DOC together explained 78% of the heterogeneity in median soil CO efflux (p < 0.001). When the carbon pool in FFL (an important source of DOC to the forest soils) was included, the explanation of variance increased to 81% (p < 0.001). Topographically regulated processes created high concentrations of mobile DOC at the footslope, and high concentrations of sorbed DOC further downslope at the toeslope, forming distinct traps of DOC that can become hotspots for soil CO production. A reduction in the uncertainty of forest carbon budgets can be achieved by taking into consideration the topographic regulation of the substrates contributing to soil CO efflux.
20456515|Dissolved silica (DSi) and its associated biological and physicochemical factors were measured in Lake Biwa, Japan and its watershed from 2002 to 2003 in order to clarify seasonal variation in the magnitude of the sink of silica and the factors that influence it within the limnetic system. Consequently, it is concluded that Lake Biwa is a noticeable body of water where a massive sink of silica is caused. Calculated silica sedimentation in Lake Biwa was 2.0  10 kg Si year (7.1  10 mol Si year) which is equivalent to about 80% of the annual inflow discharge of DSi to Lake Biwa. The magnitude of the sink varies seasonally by increasing in the winter holomictic stirring period, since it is greatly affected by the species composition of phytoplankton, the load of phosphorus and the condition of stratification. It seems reasonable to suppose that the DSi in Lake Biwa is removed mainly by biological processes, i.e., the assimilation of DSi by large centric diatoms and its accumulation in their frustules. Such silica sinks occur naturally in deeper stagnant waters, providing extended water residence time and supplying a certain amount of nutrients. These findings indicate that an increase in nutrient loads and abundance of stagnant water due to the construction of large dams lead to an expansion in the magnitude of the silica sink in a limnetic system.
41490454|In batch experiments, we studied the isotope fractionation of nitrogen and oxygen during denitrification of two bacterial strains (Azoarcus sp. strain DSM 9056 and Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain F10). Denitrification experiments were conducted with succinate and toluene as electron donor in three waters with a distinct oxygen isotope composition. Nitrate consumption was observed in all batch experiments. Reaction rates for succinate experiments were more than six times higher than those for toluene experiments. Nitrogen and oxygen isotopes became progressively enriched in the remaining nitrate pool in the course of the experiments; the nitrogen and oxygen isotope fractionation varied between 8.6-16.2 and 4.0-7.3%, respectively. Within this range, neither electron donors nor the oxygen isotope composition of the medium affected the isotope fractionation process. The experimental results provide evidence that the oxygen isotope fractionation during nitrate reduction is controlled by a kinetic isotope effect which can be quantified using the Rayleigh model. The isotopic examination of nitrite released upon denitrification revealed that nitrogen isotope fractionation largely follows the fractionation of the nitrate pool. However, the oxygen isotope values of nitrite are clearly influenced by a rapid isotope equilibration with the oxygen of the ambient water. Even though this equilibration may in part be due to storage, it shows that under certain natural conditions (re-oxidation of nitrite) the nitrate pool may also be indirectly affected by an isotope equilibration.
1468866|Pioneering marine benthic invertebrates are capable of locating and colonizing newly created and recently disturbed mud bottoms within a few days. The results of this study demonstrate that sulphides -- naturally occurring products of anaerobic organic matter decomposition -- promote the larval settlement of the pioneering polychaete Capitella sp I in both laboratory and semi-natural conditions. Settlement was enhanced both in sediments enriched with sulphides and in sulphidic, sediment-free conditions when compared with controls. A sulphide concentration ranging between 0.1 mM and 1.0 mM elicited optimal settlement with subsequent metamorphosis and survival of the settled worms. This is the first time a geochemically-mediated larval settlement response has been demonstrated.
1468901|The widespread occurrence of nitrogen limitation to net primary production in terrestrial and marine ecosystems is something of a puzzle; it would seem that nitrogen fixers should have a substantial competitive advantage wherever nitrogen is limiting, and that their activity in turn should reverse limitation. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence that nitrogen limits net primary production much of the time in most terrestrial biomes and many marine ecosystems. We examine both how the biogeochemistry of the nitrogen cycle could cause limitation to develop, and how nitrogen limitation could persist as a consequence of processes that prevent or reduce nitrogen fixation. Biogeochemical mechanism that favor nitrogen limitation include: - the substantial mobility of nitrogen across ecosystem boundaries, which favors nitogen limitation in the "source" ecosystem -- especially where denitrification is important in sediments and soils, or in terrestrial ecosystems where fire is frequent; - differences in the biochemistry of nitrogen as opposed to phosphorus (with detrital N mostly carbon-bonded and detrital P mostly ester-bonded), which favor the development of nitrogen limitation where decomposition is slow, and allow the development of a positive feedback from nitrogen limitation to producers, to reduced decomposition of their detritus, and on to reduced nitrogen availability; and - other more specialized, but perhaps no less important, processes. A number of mechanisms could keep nitrogen fixation from reversing nitrogen limitation. These include: - energetic constraints on the colonization or activity of nitrogen fixers; - limitation of nitrogen fixers or fixation by another nutrient (phosphorus, molybdenum, or iron) -- which would then represent the ultimate factor limiting net primary production; - other physical and ecological mechanisms. The possible importance of these and other processes is discussed for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.
1469893|Globally, land-use change is occurring rapidly, and impacts on biogeochemical cycling may be influenced by previous land uses. We examined differences in soil C and N cycling during long-term laboratory incubations for the following land-use sequence: indigenous forest (soil age = 1800 yr); 70-year-old pasture planted after forest clearance; 22-year-old pine (Pinus radiata) planted into pasture. No N fertilizer had been applied but the pasture contained N-fixing legumes. The sites were adjacent and received 3-6 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> "volcanic" N in rain; NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N leaching losses to streamwater were 5-21 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and followed the order forest < pasture = pine. Soil C concentration in 0-10 cm mineral soil followed the order: pasture > pine = forest, and total N: pasture > pine > forest. Nitrogen mineralization followed the order: pasture > pine > forest for mineral soil, and was weakly related to C mineralization. Based on radiocarbon data, the indigenous forest 0-10 cm soil contained more pre-bomb C than the other soils, partly as a result of microbial processing of recent C in the surface litter layer. Heterotrophic activity appeared to be somewhat N limited in the indigenous forest soil, and gross nitrification was delayed. In contrast, the pasture soil was rich in labile N arising from N fixation by clover, and net nitrification occurred readily. Gross N cycling rates in the pine mineral soil (per unit N) were similar to those under pasture, reflecting the legacy of N inputs by the previous pasture. Change in land use from indigenous forest to pasture and pine resulted in increased gross nitrification, net nitrification and thence leaching of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N.
1469135|Most estimates of regional and global soil carbon stocks are based on extrapolations of mean soil C contents for broad categories of soil or vegetation types. Uncertainties exist in both the estimates of mean soil C contents and the area over which each mean should be extrapolated. Geographic information systems now permit spatially referenced estimates of soil C at finer scales of resolution than were previously practical. We compared estimates of total soil C stocks of the state of Maine using three methods: (1) multiplying the area of the state by published means of soil C for temperate forests and for Spodosols; (2) calculating areas of inclusions of soil taxa in the 1:5,000,000 FAO/UNESCO Soils Map of the World and multiplying those areas by selected mean carbon contents; and (3) calculating soil C for each soil series and map unit in the 1:250,000 State Soil Geographic Data Base (STATSGO) and summing these estimates for the entire state. The STATSGO estimate of total soil C was between 23% and 49% higher than the common coarse scale extrapolations, primarily because STATSGO included data on Histosols, which cover less than 5% of the area of the state, but which constitute over one-third of the soil C. Spodosols cover about 65% of the state, but contribute less than 39% of the soil C. Estimates of total soil C in Maine based on the FAO map agreed within 8% of the STATSGO estimate for one possible matching of FAO soil taxa with data on soil C, but another plausible matching overestimated soil C stocks. We also compared estimates from the 1:250,000 STATSGO database and from the 1:20,000 Soil Survey Geographic Data Base (SSURGO) for a 7.5 minute quadrangle within the state. SSURGO indicated 13% less total soil C than did STATSGO, largely because the attribute data on depths of soil horizons in SSURGO are more specific for this locality. Despite localized differences, the STATSGO database offers promise of scaling up county soil survey data to regional scales because it includes attribute data and estimates of areal coverage of C-rich inclusions within map units. The spatially referenced data also permit examination of covariation of soil C stocks with soil properties thought to affect stabilization of soil C. Clay content was a poor predictor of soil C in Maine, but drainage class covaried significantly with soil C across the state.
41490506|Peatlands act as a sink of carbon (C) through the accumulation of dead remains of plants. Under global changes triggered by human activities, it is not only the sink capacity of peatland that is in danger, but also the C already stored. Invasion of Sphagnum peatlands, mainly by Molinia caerulea and Betula spp, is a growing preoccupation. This study aims to assess the extent of the influence of this invasion on the biochemical characteristics of the peat. Elemental analysis, sugar and Rock-Eval pyrolysis parameters were measured in 50 cm profiles collected in invaded and intact plots. The results show that oxygen index ratios (OICO/OICO) can be used to detect new C substrate injection as invading plants have a lower ratio than Sphagnum spp and Sphagnum peat. Total hemicellulosic sugar contents and organic matter (OM) degradation indices (R400, PPI) suggest that the invading plants promote a faster OM decomposition probably through a faster degradability and a relatively higher nutrient content of their litter. Differences in terms of nutrient status between areas of the peatland are suggested to be of great importance in determining the extent of OM transformation likely due to stoichiometric constraints.
20519843|The use of strontium isotopes and ratios of alkaline earth elements (i.e., Sr/Sr and Ca/Sr) to trace Ca sources to plants has become common in ecosystem studies. Here we examine the relative uptake of Ca and Sr in trees and subsequent accumulation in foliage. Using a whole-watershed Ca addition experiment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in N.H., we measured the uptake of Ca relative to Sr in foliage and roots of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and red spruce (Picea rubens). Vegetation was analyzed for Ca and Sr concentrations and the Sr/Sr ratio. A comparison of the Ca/Sr ratio in the vegetation and the Ca/Sr ratio of the applied mineral allows for the calculation of a discrimination factor, which defines whether Ca and Sr are incorporated and allocated in the same ratio as that which is available. A discrimination factor greater than unity indicates preferential uptake of Ca over Sr; a factor less than unity reflects preferential uptake of Sr over Ca. We demonstrate that sugar maple (SM) and yellow birch (YB) have similar and small discrimination factors (1.14  0.12, 1 and 1.16  0.09 1) in foliage formation and discrimination factors of less than 1 in root formation (0.55-0.70). Uptake into beech suggests a larger discrimination factor (1.9  1.2) in foliage but a similar root discrimination factor to SM and YB (0.66  0.06, 1). Incorporation into spruce foliage occurs at a much slower rate than in these other tree species and precludes evaluation of Ca and Sr discrimination in spruce foliage at this time. Understanding the degree to which Ca is fractionated from Sr in different species allows for refinement in the use of Sr/Sr and Ca/Sr ratios to trace Ca sources to foliage. Methods from this study can be applied to natural environments in which various soil cation pools have different Sr/Sr and Ca/Sr ratios. The results reported herein have implications for re-evaluating Ca sources and fluxes in forest ecosystems.
24716785|Winter climate change is an important environmental driver that alters the biogeochemical processes of forest soils. The decrease in snowpack amplifies soil freezethaw cycles and decreases the snowmelt water supply to soil. This study examined how snow decrease affects nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification in forest soil in northern Japan by conducting an in situ experimental snowpack manipulation experiment and a laboratory incubation of soil with different moisture, temperature and freezethaw magnitudes. For the incubation studies, surface mineral soil (010 cm) was collected from a cool-temperate natural mixed forest and incubated using the resin core method during the winter. In the field, there were two treatments: 50 and 100 % snow removal and control plots. The increase in the soil freezethaw cycle increased net N mineralization and marginally decreased the net nitrification in soil. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DOC/DON ratio in soil increased with the decrease in snowpack especially during the snow melt period. These results suggested that the change in substrate quality by the increase in freezethaw cycles caused the significant enhancement of microbial ammonium production in soil. The lower soil moisture and higher gross immobilization of inorganic N by soil microbes may be maintaining the slow net nitrification and low nitrate leaching in freezethaw cycles with less snowpack. The results indicate that winter climate change would strongly impact N biogeochemistry through the increase in ammonium availability in soil for plants and microbes, whereas it would be unlikely that nitrate loss from surface soil would be enhanced.
40343608|Methane (CH) is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO). To understand CH cycling, quantitative information about microbial CH oxidation in soils is essential. Field methods such as the gas push-pull test (GPPT) to quantify CH oxidation are often used in combination with specific inhibitors, such as acetylene (CH). Acetylene irreversibly binds to the enzyme methane monooxygenase, but little is known about recovery of CH oxidation activity after CH inhibition in situ, which is important when performing several experiments at the same location. To assess recovery of CH oxidation activity following CH inhibition, we performed a series of GPPTs over 8 weeks at two different locations in the vadose zone above a petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifer in Studen, Switzerland. After 4 weeks a maximum recovery of 30% and 50% of the respective initial activity was reached, with a subsequent slight drop in activity at both locations. Likely, CH oxidation activity and CH concentrations were too low to allow for rapid recovery following CH inhibition at the studied locations. Therefore, alternative competitive inhibitors have to be evaluated for application in conjunction with GPPTs, especially for sites with low activity.
1468653|Patterns and amounts of nitrogen loss from disturbed ecosystems vary widely. The mineralization of organic nitrogen to ammonium and then nitrification to nitrate are important processes regulating nitrogen cycling rates and nitrogen losses. Nitrification is a significant process because of the production of the nitrate anion which is easily leached or denitrified. Most studies of these processes do not evaluate their seasonal and yearly variations. This study demonstrates that marked seasonal and yearly variations can occur in these processes in different ecosystems and suggests that nitrogen loss or other system properties correlated with one arbitrarily selected collection can be misleading. Spruce-fir and ponderosa pine ecosystems demonstrated little actual or potential nitrification. Aspen and mixed conifer ecosystems demonstrated distinct seasonal patterns with increased rates of mineralization and nitrification during spring and summer months and a precipitous decline in both rates coincident with autumn foliage litterfall. The relative availability of soil nitrogen along with the amount of nitrogen circulating annually in litterfall prior to disturbance are useful predictors of the potential for nitrate production and loss following disturbance. However, other controls, including regulation by organic compounds, appear important in determining seasonal and annual variation in actual nitrification rates.
20055166|The sources of groundwater and the patterns in groundwater dissolved N and DOC concentration in the floodplain of a subtropical stream (Wollombi Brook, New South Wales) were studied over a 2-year period using three piezometer transects. While the stream was generally a discharge area for regional groundwater, this source represented only a small contribution to either the water or N budget of the alluvial aquifer. Groundwater--surface water interactions appeared mostly driven by cycles of bank recharge and discharge between the stream and the alluvial aquifer. DON and NH were the principal forms of dissolved N in groundwater, consistent with the primarily suboxic to anoxic conditions in the alluvial aquifer. A plume of groundwater NO was found at one transect where oxic conditions persisted within the riparian zone. The origin of the NO plume was hypothesized to be soil NO from the riparian zone flushed to the water table during recharge events. When present, NO did not reach surface water because conditions in the alluvial aquifer in the vicinity of the stream were always reduced. The concentration of groundwater DOC was variable across the floodplain and may be related to the extent of the vegetation cover. Overall, transformation and recycling of N during lateral exchange processes, as opposed to discharge of new N inputs from regional groundwater, appears to primarily control N cycling during groundwater--surface water interactions in this subtropical floodplain.
1468941|Organic substances are an integral part of the biogeochemistry of many elements in forest ecosystems. However, our understanding of the composition, chemistry, and reactions of these materials are incomplete and sometimes inconsistent. Therefore, we examined in detail dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in forest floor leachates over a two-year period (1992-1993), soil C, and DOC adsorption by a mineral soil to determine the relationship between soil solid and solution C characteristics in a spruce-fir ecosystem. The structural composition of DOC, DOC fractions (hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids, hydrophilic neutrals), and soil samples from the organic and mineral horizons were also analyzed using <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Total DOC in forest floor leachates ranged from 7.8 to 13.8 mmol L<sup>-1</sup> with an average of 8.6 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>. Concentrations were highest in September of both 1992 and 1993. Fractionation of the forest floor DOC indicated these solutions contained high organic acid contents that averaged 92% of the total DOC. Hydrophobic acids were also preferentially adsorbed by the B horizon. The <sup>13</sup>C NMR data suggested alkyl, carbohydrate, aromatic, and carboxylic C were the primary constituents for organic and mineral soils, DOC, and DOC fractions. Compositional changes of C were observed as aromatic and carbohydrate decreased, whereas alkyl, methoxy, and carbonyl moieties increased with depth. However, C composition changed little among the three organic layers based on the similarity of alkyl/carbohydrates ratios as determined from NMR area integration, suggesting that in this acid soil, decomposition proceeds rather slowly. Hydrophobic acids contained high contents of aromatic C, whereas hydrophilic acids were comprised primarily of carboxylic C. Hydrophilic neutrals were rich in carbohydrate C. Results indicated that these DOC fractions were unaltered during the isolation process. Carboxylic C groups appeared to dissolve easily and were probably the primary contributor to organic acidity in our organic dominate leachates. Results also suggested that DOC materials adsorbed on the B horizon underwent further biodegradation. Several seasonal patterns of C composition were observed in the forest floor leachates and DOC fractions collected between 1992 and 1993. Overall, the evidence from this study suggested that (i) DOC levels were mainly controlled by biological activity, (ii) forest floor DOC was comprised primarily of organic acids, (iii) contact of soil leachates with B horizon material affected DOC quantitatively and qualitatively, (iv) phenolic, carboxylic, and carbonyl C appeared to dissolve readily in the forest Oa horizon, (v) DOC materials adsorbed on the B horizon selectively underwent further decomposition, and (vi) C composition is a function of the extent of decomposition and DOC fractions.
1469402| Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a major light-absorbing substance, responsible for much of the color in water bodies. When sunlight energy is absorbed by DOM, some color can be lost by the process of photobleaching. We measured rates of DOM photobleaching in thirty lakes that varied greatly in color, trophic status and ionic composition. Loss of color (measured as absorbance at 440 nm and expressed as absorption coefficients) was a first order function of sunlight dose, and rates were nearly identical for 0.2 m- and GF/F-filtered samples suggesting that the process was predominantly abiotic. Photobleaching rates were rapid (color loss of 1-19% d<sup>-1</sup>) and varied about seven-fold among lakes. Our method underestimated the actual rate by 15-20% based on comparisons between the glass bottles we used in the survey and quartz containers. The large variation in photobleaching rates was examined in relation to lake trophy and chemical conditions. The best predictor of this variability was acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) (r<sup>2</sup>=0.94; p < 0.001) such that photobleaching was most rapid in the most alkaline lakes. The relationship between ANC and photobleaching suggests that differences in ionic conditions among lakes may influence the solubility and configuration of humic and fulvic acids and hence their susceptibility to photobleaching. 
41410592|Isotope analyses of nitrate and algae were used to gain better understanding of sources of nitrate to Florida's karst springs and processes affecting nitrate in the Floridan aquifer at multiple scales. In wet years, N and  of nitrate ranged from + 3 to + 9 in headwater springs in north Florida, indicating nitrification of soil ammonium as the dominant source. With below normal rainfall, the 0N and O of nitrate were higher in almost all springs (reaching + 20.2 and + 15.3, respectively) and were negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen. In springs with values of (N-NO and (O-NO greater than +10, nitrate concentrations declined 40-50% in dry years and variations in the N and  of nitrate were consistent with the effects of denitrification. Modeling of the aquifer as a closed system yielded in situ fractionation caused by denitrification of 9 and 18 for O and N, respectively. We observed no strong evidence for local sources of nitrate along spring runs; concentrations declined downstream (0.42-3.3 mol-NO L per km) and the isotopic dynamics of algae and nitrate indicated a closed system. Correlation between the N composition of nitrate and algae was observed at regional and spring-run scales, but the relationship was complicated by varying isotopic fractionation factors associated with nitrate uptake ( ranged from 2 to 13). Our study demonstrates that nitrate inputs to Florida's springs are derived predominantly from non-point sources and that denitrification is detectable in aquifer waters with relatively long residence time (i.e., matrix flow).
1469850|We examined the relative importance of exogenous (pH, water table, soil nutrient and cation availability) and endogenous (carbon quality, nutrient and cation concentrations of litter) controls on litter decay over both the short term (1 yr) and intermediate term (3 yr) in four freshwater peatland communities that occur along a P and N availability gradient in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Four litter types were reciprocally transplanted into each community. Additionally, the effects of exogenous nutrient availability and low pH on decomposition dynamics were examined by fertilizing and liming plots in the most nutrient-deficient community, the short pocosin. Both exogenous and endogenous factors were important in controlling decay rates and nutrient mineralization-immobilization dynamics. The most important site factor controlling decay rates was water table, with greater rates of decomposition in drained sites. High initial soluble phenolic concentrations and a low holocellulose quotient (% holocellulose / % lignocellulose) in litter inhibited decay rates. Despite the extremely low nutrient availability in the pocosins and low soil pH in all three communities, both the cross-community comparison and the amendment experiment in the short pocosin demonstrated that exogenous nutrient availability, endogenous nutrient concentrations in litter, and low soil pH do not inhibit decomposition in these sites. In contrast, immobilization-mineralization dynamics of N and P were largely driven by a source-sink relationship, with greatest immobilization found with high exogenous nutrient availability and low initial endogenous nutrient concentrations. We suggest a conceptual model of nutrient control over decomposition as a function of carbon quality of litter.
1469638|Nitrogen budgets of late successional forested stands and watersheds provide baseline data against which the effects of small- and large-scale disturbances may be measured. Using previously published data and supplemental new data on gaseous N loss, we construct a N budget for hillslope tabonuco forest (HTF) stands in Puerto Rico. HTF stands are subject to frequent hurricanes and landslides; here, we focus on N fluxes in the late phase of inter-disturbance forest development. N inputs from atmospheric deposition (4-6 kg N/ha/yr) are exceeded by N outputs from groundwater, gaseous N loss, and particulate N loss (6.3-15.7 kg N/ha/yr). Late-successional HTF stands also sequester N in their aggrading biomass (8 kg N/ha/yr), creating a total budget imbalance of 8.3-19.7 kg N/ha/yr. We surmise that this imbalance may be accounted for by unmeasured inputs from above- and belowground N-fixation and/or slow depletion of the large N pool in soil organic matter. Spatial and temporal variability, especially that associated with gaseous exchange and soil organic matter N-mineralization, constrain the reliability of this N budget.
1468520|In the U.S., high elevation spruce-fir forests receive greater amounts of nitrogen deposition relative to low elevation areas. At high elevations the cycling of nitrogen is naturally low due to slower decomposition and low biological N demand. The combination of these factors make spruce-fir ecosystems potentially responsive to changes in N inputs. Excess nitrogen deposition across the northeastern United States and Europe has provided an opportunity to observe ecosystem response to changing N inputs. Effects on foliar and forest floor chemistry were examined in a field study of 161 spruce-fir sites across a longitudinal (west-to-east) N deposition gradient. Both foliar elemental concentrations and forest floor elemental concentrations and rates of potential N mineralization were correlated with position along this gradient. Nitrogen deposition was positively correlated with potential forest floor nitrification and mineralization, negatively correlated with forest floor C:N and Mg concentrations and with spruce foliar lignin, lignin:N and Mg:N ratios. Foliar lignin:N and forest floor C:N were positively correlated and both were negatively correlated with nitrification and mineralization. Correlations found between forest floor and foliar N and Mg concentrations support the theory of nutrient imbalance as a potential cause of forest decline.
1468857|Lead (Pb) concentrations in wood ring segments of Carya spp. in two urban forests in Atlanta, GA, have decreased approximately 20 percent in the last decade. This pattern is consistent with reduced atmospheric Pb over the same period. We have determined that changes in Pb concentrations in wood of urban hickory trees dramatically documents the historical periods of early urbanization, the addition of Pb to gasoline, and the recent period of restricted use of leaded gasoline.
24715183|The oxidative ratio (OR) is the amount of CO sequestered in the terrestrial biosphere for each mol of O produced. The OR governs the efficiency of a terrestrial biome's O production and it has been used to calculate the balance of terrestrial and oceanic carbon sinks across the globe. However, the value used in carbon cycle calculations comes from only one study of one environment. Here we perform a meta-analysis of studies of soil organic matter and vegetation composition to calculate the first global ecosystem OR value. We use data from 138 samples across 31 studies covering 9 USDA global soil orders, 7 global biomes and 5 continents and combine this information as a weighted average based upon biome land area or organic carbon content of the soil order. Organic matter fractions could not be shown to be reliable proxies for whole soil or vegetation OR. The resulting analysis suggests that although the presently used value of 1.1 is within the range of natural occurrence, it is not the most accurate choice, representing between the 97th and 99th percentile value. Our study yields a global terrestrial OR = 1.04  0.03. This value of OR means that the sink of anthropogenic carbon fluxes to land has been underestimated (and the sink to the ocean overestimated) by up to 14 %. Recalculating with our OR value, the fossil fuel carbon flux to land is 1.48  0.04 Gt C/year and flux to oceans is 2.02  0.03 Gt C/year.
20456556|Pore water and solid phase samples were collected from the upper 50 cm of a peat profile at four sites within a 10 m area in Kleinstuck Marsh, a minerotropic fen located in Kalamazoo, MI. Although the chosen sites are in close proximity to each other, they differ with respect to vegetation species and density. Pore water analyses for a suite of redox sensitive species (pH, alkalinity, dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), Fe(III), sulfide, sulfate), together with Fe and Mn distributions inferred from operationally-defined sequential extractions, demonstrate that Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction occurs in the shallow peat at three of the four sites. At the fourth site, the only site containing the invasive purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), accumulation of dissolved sulfide in the pore waters and increased levels of oxidizable phases in the shallow peat point to increased net sulfate reduction relative to the other three sites. Speciation calculations indicate that pore water concentrations of phosphate, especially below 10 cm depth, are largely controlled by the solubility of phases such as strengite or hydroxylapatite, and that at all but the loosestrife site, dissolved Ca and Mg are likely determined by carbonate solubility. Fe and Mn distribution among operationally defined solid phase fractions are consistent with reductive dissolution of FMO in the uppermost peat, leading to precipitation of Fe sulfides and Mn carbonates deeper in the peat profile. Zn, Co, Cr and Ni distributions are consistent with release from FMO to form sulfides or organic associations deeper in the peat. Pb and Cu may also be released by reductive dissolution of FMO, or more likely, shift from primary association with organic matter to increased association with sulfides under more sulfidic conditions. This study highlights the existence of extreme lateral variations in peat pore water and solid phase geochemical profiles, even over quite small areas.
40343537|The microbial metabolism of organic matter (OM) in seagrass beds can create sulfidic conditions detrimental to seagrass growth; iron (Fe) potentially has ameliorating effects through titration of the sulfides and the precipitation of iron-sulfide minerals into the sediment. In this study, the biogeochemical effects of Fe availability and its interplay with sulfur and OM on sulfide toxicity, phosphorous (P) availability, seagrass growth and community structure were tested. The availability of Fe and OM was manipulated in a 2 x 2 factorial experiment arranged in a Latin square, with four replicates per treatment. The treatments included the addition of Fe, the addition of OM, the addition of both Fe and OM as well as no addition. The experiment was conducted in an oligotrophic, iron-deficient seagrass bed. Fe had an 84.5% retention efficiency in the sediments with the concentration of Fe increasing in the seagrass leaves over the course of the experiment. Porewater chemistry was significantly altered with a dramatic decrease in sulfide levels in Fe addition plots while sulfide levels increased in the OM addition treatments. Phosphorus increased in seagrass leaves collected in the Fe addition plots. Decreased sulfide stress was evidenced by heavier S in leaves and rhizomes from plots to which Fe was added. The OM addition negatively affected seagrass growth but increased P availability; the reduced sulfide stress in Fe added plots resulted in elevated productivity. Fe availability may be an important determinant of the impact that OM has on seagrass vitality in carbonate sediments vegetated with seagrasses.
40343629|Nitrate has long been thought to be chemically unreactive in soil. This view was challenged by the report of an apparently abiotic process whereby nitrate (NO) is incorporated into organic compounds (Daii et al. 2001). In Colman et al. (2007), we examined how common this process might be by testing for it in 45 soils collected from across a range of ecosystem types. We found no evidence of this process occurring in any of the soils, but found evidence of an analytical artifact that creates the appearance of incorporation. We suggested that prior evidence of this process might be due in part or in total to this analytical artifact. Davidson et al. (2008), however, challenged our results and conclusions, suggesting that we failed to observe the abiotic incorporation because we eliminated the anaerobic microsites they argue are necessary for the process. We address the criticisms, and show that they actually raise questions about the robustness of the only study to have reported abiotic NO incorporation in sterile soils. We argue that this area of research needs new artifact-free experiments if the controversy is going to be resolved.
1468826|The interactions between the biotic processes of reproduction, growth, and death and the abiotic processes which regulate temperature and water availability, and the interplay between the biotic and abiotic processes regulating N and light availabilities are important in the dynamics of forest ecosystems. We have developed a computer simulation that assembles a model ecosystem which links these biotic and abiotic interactions through equations that predict decomposition processes, actual evapotranspiration, soil water balance, nutrient uptake, growth of trees, and light penetration through the canopy. The equations and parameters are derived directly from field studies and observations of forests in eastern North America, resulting in a model that can make accurate quantitative predictions of biomass accumulation, N availability, soil humus development and net primary production.
20456392|In forest ecosystems the single largest respiratory flux influencing net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is the total soil CO efflux; however, it is difficult to make measurements of this flux that are accurate at the ecosystem scale. We examined patterns of soil CO efflux using five different methods: auto-chambers, portable gas analyzers, eddy covariance along and two models parameterized with the observed data. The relation between soil temperature and soil moisture with soil CO effluxes are also investigated, both inter-annually and seasonally, using these observations/results. Soil respiration rates (
41490518|Large, sub-alpine, stratified lakes are directly within the scope of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and need adapted monitoring systems. Moreover, anthropogenic eutrophication was frequently the main cause of their water quality degradation in the 20th century. This paper is primarily aimed at demonstrating how in situ sensor-equipped buoys could be the base of monitoring designs to support the WFD objectives. The core of this paper, mainly methodological, focuses on single-depth, high frequency (4 per hour) fluorescence measurements. It shows that the internal wave pattern provides additional information to the singledepth time series to assess phytoplankton dynamics in a stratified water column displaying strong, vertical biomass heterogeneity. The paper deals with the following three aspects: (1) definition of an indicator to determine whether or not the sensor actually detects the metalimnetic fluorescence peak, (2) vertical representation of chlorophyll distribution from single-depth series; (3) time evolution of the fluorescence peak (maximum value, depth and associated temperature, peak width).
1469847| A well-defined nitrogen retention and turnover budget was estimated for a shallow oligohaline lake (Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, USA). In 1997 a month-long diversion of the Mississippi River filled the Lake with highly concentrated river water (80 M nitrate) and lowered the salinity to 0 psu within 2 weeks. After the spillway was closed the Lake mixed with estuarine tidal waters and came to equilibrium over 4 months with the riverine, atmospheric and offshore water nitrogen sources. A flushing rate of 1.78% d<sup>-1</sup> was estimated by analyzing a plot of ln salinity versus time for the first 120 days after the diversion ceased. This flushing rate was similar to the loss rate for total nitrogen (1.75% d<sup>-1</sup>), implying no significant net nitrogen losses or gains were occurring inside the Lake. The percent loss of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was higher than that for TN (4.11% d<sup>-1</sup>), whereas the loss of organic nitrogen was lower (0.94% d<sup>-1</sup>), which suggests a net transfer from inorganic to organic nitrogen. These changes occurred steadily as chlorophyll a concentration ranged from 5 to 200  g l<sup>-1</sup>. The results demonstrate the potential significance of the organic nitrogen and interconversion of nitrogen forms when calculating estuarine nitrogen retention budgets and the necessity of measuring all nitrogen forms when performing mass balance estimates. The significance of denitrification in nitrogen removal is minimal at the high loading rates observed during this study. An implication to estuarine water quality management is that the relationships between nitrogen loading and retention are not linear and are controlled by factors other than water residence time. 
41490555|A vast amount of volatile organohalogens (VOX) has natural origins. Both soils and sediments have been shown to release VOX, which are most likely produced via redox reactions between Fe(III) and quinones in the presence of halide anions, particularly at acidic pH. We tested whether acidophilic Fe(III)-reducers might indirectly stimulate natural VOX formation at acidic pH by providing reactive Fe and quinone species. However, it is unknown whether acidophilic Fe(III)-reducers can reduce humic acids (HA) or fulvic acids (FA). We therefore tested the ability of the acidophilic Fe(III)-reducer Acidiphilium SJH to reduce macromolecular, suspended HA and dissolved FA at pH 3.1-3.3. We found that (i) SJH can neither reduce HA/FA nor the humic model quinone anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonicacid (AQDS) nor stimulate the formation of FA radicals, (ii) at acidic pH, significantly more electrons are transferred abiotically both from native and reduced FA to dissolved Fe(III) than from native or reduced HA, and (iii) the presence of strain SJH does not stimulate VOX formation. Our results imply that the acidophilic Fe(III)-reducer SJH either uses an enzyme for Fe(III) reduction that can neither be used for HA/FA nor for AQDS reduction or that the location of Fe(III) reduction is inaccessible for these compounds. We further conclude that microorganisms such as strain SJH probably do not indirectly stimulate natural VOX formation at acidic pH via the formation of reactive quinone species.
24715348|In order to develop Ca isotopes as a tracer for biogeochemical Ca cycling in terrestrial environments and for Ca utilisation in plants, stable calcium isotope ratios were measured in various species of alpine plants, including woody species, grasses and herbs. Analysis of plant parts (root, stem, leaf and flower samples) provided information on Ca isotope fractionation within plants and seasonal sampling of leaves revealed temporal variation in leaf Ca isotopic composition. There was significant Ca isotope fractionation between soil and root tissue 44/42 Carootsoil  0.40 in all investigated species, whereas Ca isotope fractionation between roots and leaves was species dependent. Samples of leaf tissue collected throughout the growing season also highlighted species differences: Ca isotope ratios increased with leaf age in woody species but remained constant in herbs and grasses. The Ca isotope fractionation between roots and soils can be explained by a preferential binding of light Ca isotopes to root adsorption sites. The observed differences in whole plant Ca isotopic compositions both within and between species may be attributed to several potential factors including root cation exchange capacity, the presence of a woody stem, the presence of Ca oxalate, and the levels of mycorrhizal infection. Thus, the impact of plants on the Ca biogeochemical cycle in soils, and ultimately the Ca isotope signature of the weathering flux from terrestrial environments, will depend on the species present and the stage of vegetation succession.
20055188|Soil CO flux can contribute as much as 60-80% of total ecosystem respiration in forests. Although considerable research has focused on quantifying this flux during the growing season, comparatively little effort has focused on non-growing season fluxes. We measured soil CO efflux through snow in 50 and 300 year old subalpine forest stands near Fraser CO. Our objectives were to quantify seasonal patterns in wintertime soil CO flux; determine if differences in soil CO flux between the two forest ages during the growing season persist during winter; and to quantify the sample size necessary to discern treatment differences. Soil CO flux during the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 snow season averaged 0.31 and 0.35 mols
1469388|The influence of riffle-pool units on hyporheic zone hydrology and nitrogen dynamics was investigated in Brougham Creek, a N-rich agricultural stream in Ontario, Canada. Subsurface hydraulic gradients, differences in background stream and groundwater concentrations of conservative ions, and the movement of a bromide tracer indicated the downwelling of stream water at the head of riffles and upwelling in riffle-pool transitions under base flow conditions. Channel water also flowed laterally into the floodplain at the upstream end of riffles and followed a subsurface concentric flow path for distances of up to 20 m before returning to the stream at the transition from riffles to pools. Differences in observed vs predicted concentrations based on background chloride patterns indicated that the hyporheic zone was a sink for nitrate and a source for ammonium. The removal of nitrate in the streambed was confirmed by the loss of nitrate in relation to co-injected bromide in areas of downwelling stream water in two riffles. Average stream water nitrate-N concentrations of 1.0 mg/L were often depleted to <0.005 mg/L near the sediment-water interface. Consequently, an extensive volume of the hyporheic zone in the streambed and floodplain had a large unused potential for nitrate removal. Conceptual models based mainly on studies of streams with low nutrient concentrations have emphasized the extent of surface-subsurface exchanges and water residence times in the hyporheic zone as important controls on stream nutrient retention. In contrast, we suggest that nitrate retention in N-rich streams is influenced more by the size of surface water storage zones which increase the residence time of channel water in contact with the major sites of rapid nitrate depletion adjacent to the sediment-water interface.
24715109|Hg cycling in biologically productive coastal areas is of special importance given the potential for bioaccumulation of monomethylmercury (MMHg) into aquatic organisms. Field experiments were performed during three different seasons in Arcachon Bay, a mesotidal lagoon (SW France), to assess the variability of the water column concentrations, sedimentwater exchanges and potential formation and degradation of MMHg. The objectives were to evaluate the contribution of intertidal mudflats to MMHg production and the various pathways of Hg species export. Dissolved and bulk concentrations of Hg species in the water column downstream of tidal flats were measured throughout several tidal cycles. The Hg benthic fluxes at the sedimentwater interface were determined by means of benthic chambers for three different stations. Hg methylation and demethylation potentials were determined in surficial sediments and the water column using isotopic tracers. The tidal surveys demonstrated that benthic remobilization of Hg occurs primarily in association with sediment erosion and advection during ebb tide. However, elevated dissolved Hg concentrations observed at low tide were found to be caused by a combination of pore-waters seeping, benthic fluxes and methylation in the water column. Benthic fluxes were more intense during late winter conditions (median MMHg and inorganic Hg (IHg) fluxes: 64 and 179 pmol m h, respectively) and subsequently decreased in spring (median 0.7 and 5 pmol m h, respectively) and fall (median 0.4 and 1.3 pmol m h, respectively). The trends in methylation and demethylation potentials were at the opposite of the fluxes, two times lower during winter than for spring or fall conditions. In this tidal environment, MMHg production in surface sediments and its subsequent release is estimated to be the major source of MMHg to the water column during winter and spring time. However, during the more productive summer period, the Hg methylation extent in the water column may be very significant and equivalent to the sediment contribution.
1469603| We investigated the seasonal and geographical variation in the stable carbon isotope ratios of total dissolved inorganic carbon ( <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub>) and suspended matter ( <sup>13</sup>C<sub>POC</sub>) in the freshwater part of the River Scheldt. Two major sources of particulate organic matter (POM) occur in this riverine system: riverine phytoplankton and terrestrial detritus. In winter the lowest  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> values are observed due to enhanced input of CO<sub>2</sub> from decomposition of <sup>13</sup>C-depleted terrestrial plant detritus (average  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> = -14.3). During summer, when litter input from terrestrial flora is the lowest, water column respiration on POM of terrestrial origin is also the lowest as evidenced by less negative  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> values (average  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> = -9.9). In winter the phytoplankton biomass is low, as indicated by low chlorophyll a concentrations (<latex>$\text{Chl a}<4.5\ \mu \text{gl}^{-1}$</latex>), compared to summer when chlorophyll a concentrations can rise to a maximum of 54  gl<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, in winter the very narrow range of  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>POC</sub> (from -26.5 to -27.6) is associated with relatively high C/N ratios (C/N > 9) suggesting that in winter a major fraction of POC is derived from allochthonous matter. In summer  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>POC</sub> exhibits a very wide range of values, with the most negative values coinciding with high Chl a concentrations and low C/N ratios (C/N < 8). This suggests predominance of phytoplankton carbon in the total particulate carbon pool, utilising a dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir, which is already significantly depleted in <sup>13</sup>C. Using a simple two source mixing approach a reconstruction of the relative importance of phytoplankton to the total POC pool and of <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C fractionation by phytoplankton is attempted. 
24715351|Benthic biogeochemistry and macrofauna were investigated six times over 1 year in a shallow sub-tropical embayment. Benthic fluxes of oxygen (annual mean 918 mol O m h), ammonium (NH), nitrate (NO), dissolved organic nitrogen, dinitrogen gas (N), and dissolved inorganic phosphorus were positively related to OM supply (N mineralisation) and inversely related to benthic light (N assimilation). Ammonium (NH), NO and N fluxes (annual means +14.6, +15.9 and 44.6 mol N m h) accounted for 14, 16 and 53 % of the annual benthic N remineralisation respectively. Denitrification was dominated by coupled nitrificationdenitrification throughout the study. Potential assimilation of nitrogen by benthic microalgae (BMA) accounted for between 1 and 30 % of remineralised N, and was greatest during winter when bottom light was higher. Macrofauna biomass tended to be highest at intermediate benthic respiration rates (1,000 mol O m h), and appeared to become limited as respiration increased above this point. While bioturbation did not significantly affect net fluxes, macrofauna biomass was correlated with increased light rates of NH flux which may have masked reductions in NH flux associated with BMA assimilation during the light. Peaks in net N fluxes at intermediate respiration rates are suggested to be associated with the stimulation of potential denitrification sites due to bioturbation by burrowing macrofauna. NO fluxes suggest that nitrification was not significantly limited within respiration range measured during this study, however comparisons with other parts of Moreton Bay suggest that limitation of coupled nitrificationdenitrification may occur in sub-tropical systems at respiration rates exceeding 1,500 mol O m h.
20055294|Elevated nitrogen deposition has increased tree growth, the storage of soil organic matter, and nitrate leaching in many European forests, but little is known about the effect of tree species and nitrogen deposition on nitrous oxide emission. Here we report soil NO emission from European beech, Scots pine and Norway spruce forests in two study areas of Germany with distinct climate, N deposition and soils. NO emissions and throughfall input of nitrate and ammonium were measured biweekly during growing season and monthly during dormant season over a 28 months period. Annual NO emission rates ranged between 0.4 and 1.3 kg N
24715364|Dissolved silica (DSi) is an important nutrient in aquatic ecosystems. Increased DSi retention within the fluvial system due to damming and eutrophication has led to a decrease in DSi exports to coastal waters, which can have severe consequences for coastal areas where ecosystem functioning depends on fluvial DSi inputs. The analysis of fluvial DSi fluxes and DSi retention at regional to global scales is thus an important research topic. This study explores the possibility to empirically assess regional DSi retention based on a spatially explicit estimation of DSi mobilization and fluvial DSi fluxes calculated from hydrochemical monitoring data. The uncertainty of DSi retention rates (rDSi) estimated for particular rivers is high. Nevertheless, for the St. Lawrence River (rDSi = 91 %) and the Mississippi River (rDSi = 13 %) the estimated DSi retention rates are reasonable and are supported by literature values. The variety of sources of the uncertainty in the DSi retention assessment is discussed.
40343525|To determine the dominant processes controlling nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils and increase insights into soil N cycling from nitrogen isotope (N) data, patterns of N enrichment in soil profiles were compiled from studies on tropical, temperate, and boreal systems. The maximum N enrichment between litter and deeper soil layers varied strongly with mycorrhizal fungal association, averaging 9.6  0.4 in ectomycorrhizal systems and 4.6  0.5 in arbuscular mycorrhizal systems. The N enrichment varied little with mean annual temperature, precipitation, or nitrification rates. One main factor controlling N in soil profiles, fractionation against N during N transfer by mycorrhizal fungi to host plants, leads to N-depleted plant litter at the soil surface and N-enriched nitrogen of fungal origin at depth. The preferential preservation of N-enriched compounds during decomposition and stabilization is a second important factor. A third mechanism, N loss during nitrification and denitrification, may account for large N enrichments with depth in less N-limited forests and may account for soil profiles where maximum N is at intermediate depths. Mixing among soil horizons should also decrease differences among soil horizons. We suggest that dynamic models of isotope distributions within soil profiles that can incorporate multiple processes could provide additional information about the history of nitrogen movements and transformations at a site.
23359717|The influences of physico-chemical and biological processes on dimethylsulfide (DMS) dynamics in the most oligotrophic subtropical zones of the global ocean were investigated. As metrics for the dynamics of DMS and the so-called 'summer DMS paradox' of elevated summer concentrations when surface chlorophyll a (Chl) and particulate organic carbon (POC) levels are lowest, we used the DMS-to-Chl and DMS-to-POC ratios in the context of three independent and complementary approaches. Firstly, field observations of environmental variables (such as the solar radiation dose, phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton and bacterial growth) were used alongside discrete DMS, Chl and POC estimates extracted from global climatologies (i.e., a 'station based' approach). We then used monthly climatological data for DMS, Chl, and POC averaged over the biogeographic province wherein a given oligotrophic subtropical zone resides (i.e., a 'province based' approach). Finally we employed sensitivity experiments with a new DMS module coupled to the ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model PISCES to examine the influence of various processes in governing DMS dynamics in oligotrophic regions (i.e., a 'model based' approach). We find that the 'station based' and 'province based' approaches yield markedly different results. Interestingly, the 'province based' approach suggests the presence of a 'summer DMS paradox' in most all of the oligotrophic regions we studied. In contrast, the 'station based' approach suggests that the 'summer DMS paradox' is only present in the Sargasso Sea and eastern Mediterranean. Overall, we found the regional differences in the absolute and relative concentrations of DMS between 5 of the most oligotrophic regions of the world's oceans were better accounted for by their nutrient dynamics (specifically phosphorus limitation) than by physical factors often invoked, e.g., the solar radiation dose. Our 'model based' experiments suggest that it is the limitation of phytoplankton/bacterial production and bacterial consumption of DMS by pervasive phosphorus limitation that is responsible for the 'summer DMS paradox'.
23359703|Dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium occur as endosymbionts in a variety of hosts including coral. The response of Symbiodinium spp. to environmental changes could dictate survival of their hosts and the ecological success of coral reef ecosystems. Oxidative stress has been linked to a breakdown in this symbiotic relationship, known as bleaching. Increased temperature is one of the primary environmental changes linked to this phenomenon. Preliminary studies have established high concentrations of the sulfur compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in Symbiodinium spp., with increased temperature. To examine the potential use of DMSP as an antioxidant, a 5 day incubation experiment was conducted at two temperatures with the algae S. microadriaticum (CCMP1633) isolated from the cnidarian host Aiptasia pulchella. An HPLC assay for the activity of the enzyme B 12 -dependent methionine synthase was modified and used to determine the link between de novo production of methionine, a precursor to DMSP, and temperature induced oxidative stress. DMSP concentrations per cell increased approximately 38 % in the 33 C treatment cultures over 120 h. However, these cells also increased more than 2-fold in biovolume (127  43 %), and SYTO-BC stain indicated increased DNA content (approximately 4-fold), suggesting arrested cell division. Normalization of DMSP to biovolume revealed that the concentrations actually decreased approximately 49 % after 2 days in cultures exposed to elevated temperature (33 C), but were not significantly different from the control treatment at 120 h (27 C). Concomitant changes in the 33 C treatment relative to the control (after 120 h) resulted in an approximately 8-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, a 37 % (7 %) decrease in photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II, and a 5-fold increase in xanthophyll cycling. Methionine synthase activity (MSA) correlated to the decrease in DMSP concentration (R 2 = 0.778), with decreasing activity at the high temperature. Given this decrease in MSA, the increase in DMSP per cell may be due to DMSP production utilizing methionine from protein turnover, and not de novo synthesis via MSA. The findings of this study provide insight into the responses of algal symbionts to environmental changes, shed light on the potential use of DMSP and other known photo-protective mechanisms such as xanthophyll cycling under temperature induced oxidative stress, and support the suspected cessation of cell division under these conditions. This information could be crucial to understanding cellular responses to environmental changes and the ability of these organisms to survive under elevated sea surface temperatures projected for the near future.
1468957|The influence of leaves of Quercus suber L. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and needles of Pinus pinaster Ait. on a sandstone substrate was assessed through lysimetric studies during a ten-year period at a site in Central Portugal. The decomposition rate of Q. suber leaf litter was similar to that of E. globulus and higher than that of P. pinaster needle litter. The proportion of nitrogen released from the Q. suber leaf litter was higher than that lost from the other organic species. Such a release was proportional to the initial nitrogen content in the substrates. The concentrations of both NH<sub>4</sub>-N and NO<sub>3</sub>-N were much higher in leachates collected under Q. suber leaf litter than in those collected under the other organic substrates. A similar trend was found in the leachates collected under the mineral substrate influenced by the studied organic substrates. The leachate concentrations of mineral N (especially NH<sub>4</sub>-N) were higher from the mineral substrate under Q. suber leaf litter than from this organic substrate itself. The mineral substrate under leaf litter of E. globulus or needle litter of P. pinaster showed an increase in exchangeable base cations and pH values, and a decrease in extractable Al. Conversely, in the substrate with Q. suber leaf litter there was only a slight increase in exchangeable base cations and pH values, and a decrease in extractable Al. These results combined with those obtained in soils under E. globulus plantations indicate that changes found in these soils are due to soil and forest management practices rather than to the decomposition process of the respective of leaf litter.
1469764|Isotopes of Be and C were used to reconstruct loess accumulation, hillslope evolution, and agricultural modification in soils of western Iowa. While both elements are derived from additions by the atmosphere (via plants in the case of carbon), the differences in element cycling allow erosional and depositional processes to be separated from biochemical processing. Based on <sup>10</sup>Be, loess accumulation likely occurred simultaneously with hillslope degradation. Rates of loess accumulation declined five-fold between early stages (late Pleistocene and early Holocene) and later stages (late Holocene) of accumulation, but the absolute timing of accumulation requires independent dating methods. Based on <sup>14</sup>C measurements, plant inputs and decomposition are significant near the surface, but below 1-1.5 m carbon inputs are minimal and decomposition is nearly arrested. The amount of carbon below 1.5 m is constant (0.1%) and is composed of soil organic matter that was buried by loess. Agricultural modification results in a dramatic redistribution of <sup>10</sup>Be through soil erosion and deposition. By contrast, the redistribution of soil organic matter is masked by the rapid cycling of C through the topsoil as it continually decomposes and is replaced by plant inputs.
1469295|By synthesizing more than twenty years of research at the Fernow Experimental Forest, we have documented 7 symptoms of nitrogen saturation in two adjacent watersheds. The symptoms include: 1) high relative rates of net nitrification, 2) long-term increases in stream-water concentrations of nitrate and base cations, 3) relatively high nitrate concentrations in solution losses, 4) little seasonal variability in stream-water nitrate concentrations, 5) a high discharge of nitrate from a young aggrading forest, 6) a rapid increase in nitrate loss following fertilization of a young aggrading forest, and 7) low retention of inorganic nitrogen when compared with other forested sites. These data support current conceptual models of nitrogen saturation and provide a strong, and perhaps the best, example of nitrogen saturation in the United States.
1469037| The release of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and <sup>15</sup>N-labelled NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> by one-step KCl extraction was assessed in different types of coastal marine sediments. KCl was efficient to extract NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> from sandy sediments and less efficient in silt sediments, where an extended extraction period was required for obtaining a maximum NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> yield. Extraction at 0 or 20 C had only a little effect on the efficiency of KCl. KCl gave always non complete recovery of <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in silt sediments. However, the added label could be fully recovered by addition of 80  mol cm<sup>-3</sup> exogenous NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> prior to KCl, or when NaCl or ASW replaced KCl. <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was added to non-biological silt sediment, which was incubated at 0 C up to 16 hours, to see the effect of physical processes on the partition of <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> among porewater (29-49%) exchangeable (9-30%) and non-extractable, organic bound pools (24-42%). Total <sup>15</sup>N recovery was approximately 100%. KCl failed to remove <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> which entered to unknown, bound pools in sediment. Only shortly after addition of <sup>15</sup>N(0.1 h), the extraction period resulted in significantly different <sup>15</sup>N recoveries (P < 0.05) in KCl extractable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, 17% versus 9% of label was recovered after 1 min or 60 min extraction of sediment, respectively. Two hours of incubation time were required for complete equilibrium of <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> among porewater, exchangeable and organic bound pools. Sediments (silt) to which <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> has been added in order to measure NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> turn-over and KCl is used as extractant, should be incubated for at least 2 hours, before taking a zero-time sample. 
1469161| Evidence that environmental levels of vanadium are increasing has raised concern over the injection of vanadium into the environment from anthropogenic sources. Two simple global mass balance models (simulating current and pre-industrial conditions) were developed to demonstrate the influence of anthropogenic vanadium on the global distribution of this trace metal. Current vanadium emissions owing to man's current industrial activities were estimated to comprise 30% of total atmosphere loading, 3% of total ocean loading, and 6% of total land loading. These loadings were always considerably less than those resulting from non-anthropogenic sources or events. Differences noted between the pre-industrial and current models were not sufficiently great to suggest that injection of anthropogenic vanadium constitutes a significant environmental threat on a global scale. 
1468654| The non-protein amino acids, -alanine and -aminobutyric acid, frequently dominate the amino acid composition of deep-sea sediments. This accumulation is most likely due to the slower decomposition of non-protein amino acids by microorganisms or to the preferential adsorption of non-protein amino acids by clay minerals. We investigated relative rates of heterotrophic uptake of alanine, -ala, and -aba in sea water to see if there were different rates of microbial assimilation and respiration between these protein and non-protein amino acids. Heterotrophic uptake was rapid for all three amino acids with turnover times of hours in productive coastal waters and days in more oligotrophic open-ocean waters. Uptake of the non-protein amino acids was significantly slower than uptake of alanine, particularly in anoxic waters. However, the difference in uptake rates is probably not great enough to cause significant preferential accumulation of non-protein amino acids. 
1469747|Wetlands are significant sources of the important greenhouse gas CH<sub>4</sub>.

We show that, in the ecosystem studied, ebullition (bubble emission) may account for 18 to 50% of the total CH<sub>4</sub> emission, representing fluxes that have been difficult to estimate accurately in the past. Furthermore, using plant removal and <sup>14</sup>C labelling techniques, we use the system to detail the direct influence of vascular plants on CH<sub>4</sub> emission. This influence is observed to be dependent on the amount of vascular plants present. The results that may be produced using the presented experimental set-up have implications for an improved understanding of wetland ecosystem/atmosphere interactions, including possible feedback effects on climate change. In recent years much attention has been devoted to ascertaining and subsequently using the relationship between net ecosystem productivity and CH<sub>4</sub> emission as a basis for extrapolation of fluxes across large areas. The experimental system presented may be used to study the complex relationship between vascular plants and CH<sub>4</sub> emission and here we show examples of how this may vary considerably in nature between and even within ecosystems.
1468794| Vertical profiles were measured in soil cores taken from flooded rice fields in the Po valley during July and August 1990. Methane concentrations generally increased with depth and reached maximum values of 150-500 M in 5-13 cm depth. However, the shape of the profiles was very different when studying different soil cores. The CH<sub>4</sub> content of gas bubbles showed a similar variability which apparently was due to spatial rather than temporal inhomogeneities. Similar inhomogeneities were observed in the vertical profiles of acetate, propionate, lactate, and formate which showed maximum values of 1500, 66, 135, and 153 M, respectively. However, maxima and minima of the vertical profiles of the different substates usually coincided in one particular soil core. Large inhomogeneities in the vertical profiles were also observed for the rates of total CH<sub>4</sub> production, however, the percentage contribution of H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub> production was relatively homogeneous at 24  7% (SD). Similarly, the H<sub>2</sub> content of gas bubbles was relatively constant at 93.3  9.6 ppmv when randomly sampled in the rice field at different times of the day. A small contribution (6%) of H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> to acetate production was also observed. Vertical profiles of the respiratory index (RI) for [2-<sup>14</sup>C] acetate showed that acetate was predominantly degraded by methanogenesis in 5-11 cm depth, but by respiration in the surface soil (3 cm depth) and in soil layers below 13-16 cm depth which coincided with a transition of the colour (grey to reddish) and the physical characteristics (porosity, density) of the soil. The observations indicate that the microbial community which degrades organic matter to CH<sub>4</sub> is in itself relatively homogenous, but operates at highly variable rates within the soil structure. 
40343627|Catchment nitrogen (N) budgets are a valuable tool to assess relative magnitude of N inputs and predict losses via riverine export. However, a range of computational approaches may be chosen, potentially affecting the modeled relationship between inputs and exports. To determine the influence of various assumptions and computational details on the effectiveness of N input estimates in predicting riverine N export, we compared eight separate net anthropogenic N input budgets and one soils compartment budget for each of 18 Lake Michigan catchments. N input estimation methods that took into account seasonal fluctuations in livestock numbers and estimated crop N-fixation by legume yield rather than area harvested best predicted river N export. The average annual river export of N from the 18 catchments ranged from less than 300 kg N km year in forested areas to more than 800 kg-N km year in agricultural catchments and 1,580 kg-N km year in small urban catchments. Using the most effective model (R = 0.95, median prediction error = 1.8%) riverine N exports were found to account for 21% of N inputs. Other methods predicted riverine N exports less well (R = 0.61-0.73), bias was greater, and the fractional export of N inputs by rivers decreased to ~13%. The soil  budget also was a less effective predictor of river export. This comparison demonstrates that N budgeting that incorporates more detailed description of agricultural N sources can substantially improve prediction of riverine N exports from catchments with a wide range of landscape characteristics.
40800594|The Arctic treeline is advancing in many areas and changes in carbon (C) cycling are anticipated. Differences in CO exchange between adjacent forest and tundra are not well known and contrasting conclusions have been drawn about the effects of forest advance on ecosystem C stocks. Measurements of CO exchange in tundra and adjacent forest showed the forest was a greater C sink during the growing season in northern Canada. There is, however, reason to expect that forests lose more C than tundra during the wintertime, as forests may accumulate and retain more snow. Deeper snow insulates the soil and warmer soils should lead to greater rates of belowground respiration and CO efflux. In this study, I tested the hypotheses that forests maintain a deeper snowpack, have warmer soils and lose more C during winter than adjacent tundra near the Arctic treeline in northwest Alaska. Measurements of snow depth, soil temperature and CO efflux were made at five forest and two treeline sites in late winter of three consecutive years. Snow depth and soil temperature were greater in forest than treeline sites, particularly in years with higher snowfall. There was a close exponential correlation between soil temperature and CO efflux across sites and years. The temperature-efflux model was driven using hourly soil temperatures from all the sites to provide a first approximation of the difference in winter C loss between treeline and forest sites. Results showed that greater wintertime C loss from forests could offset greater summertime C gain.
1469721|Dissolved oxygen concentrations in river-sediment porewaters are reported and modelled using a zero-order reaction rate and the Monod equation. After mixing the sediments and allowing settling, the dissolved oxygen profile in the bed-sediment was expected to reach a steady-state rapidly (< 1 h). However changes in the vertical profile of oxygen over a period of 38 days revealed that the penetration of oxygen increased and the dissolved oxygen flux at the interface decreased with time, probably as the oxidation kinetics of organic matter and redox reactions in the sediment changed. Experiments with three contrasting silt and sand dominated sediments (organic matter content between 0.9 and 18%) at two water velocities (ca 10 and 20 cm s<sup>-1</sup>) showed that the dissolved oxygen profiles were independent of velocity for each of the sediments. The most important controls on the reaction rate were the organic matter content and specific surface area of the sediment. A viscous diffuse-boundary-layer above the sediment was only detected in the experiments with the silt sediment where the sediment oxygen demand was relatively high. In the coarser sediments, the absence of a diffuse layer indicated that slow oxidation processes in the sediment controlled the dissolved oxygen flux at the interface. The problem of determining a surface reference in coarse sediment is highlighted. The results are discussed with reference to other studies including those concerned with estuarine and marine sediments.
24715355|Understanding pasture degradation processes is the key for sustainable land management in the tropical mountain rainforest region of the South Ecuadorian Andes. We estimated the stocks of total carbon and nutrients, microbial biomass and different P fractions along a gradient of land-uses that is typical of the eastern escarpment of the Cordillera Real i.e., old-growth evergreen lower montane forest, active pastures (17 and 50 years-old), abandoned pastures 10 and 20 years old with bracken fern or successional vegetation. Conversion of forest to pasture by slash-and-burn increased the stocks of SOC, TN, P and S in mineral topsoil of active pasture sites. Microbial growth in pasture soils was enhanced by improved availability of nutrients, C:N ratio, and increased soil pH. Up to 39 % of the total P in mineral soil was stored in the microbial biomass indicating its importance as a dynamic, easily available P reservoir at all sites. At a 17 years-old pasture the stock of NHF extractable organic P, which is considered to be mineralisable in the short-term, was twice as high as in all other soils. The importance of the NaOH extractable organic P pool increased with pasture age. Pasture degradation was accelerated by a decline of this P stock, which is essential for the long-term P supply. Stocks of microbial biomass, total N and S had returned to forest levels 10 years after pasture abandonment; soil pH and total P 20 years after growth of successional bush vegetation. Only the C:N ratio increased above forest level indicating an ongoing loss of N after 20 years. Soil nutrient depletion and microbial biomass decline enforced the degradation of pastures on the investigated Cambisol sites.
40800596|Substantial amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be released during decomposition and these compounds can affect atmospheric chemistry, belowground processes, and the structure of microbial communities in litter and soil. However, we have a limited understanding of the types, quantities and ecological impacts of VOCs emitted from litter. Here we used a closed flow-through system and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) to characterize VOC emissions from soil and two litter types (Pinus taeda and Acer rubrum) over a 72-day incubation period. Microbial respiration rates were measured throughout the incubation, and the soils were harvested at the end of the incubation to determine how litter VOCs influenced soil C dynamics, N mineralization rates, and bacterial communities. Using the PTR-MS we identified over 100 VOCs, with 10 VOCs making up the majority of emissions. VOCs accounted for up to 2.5% of the C flux from litter. Soil was a net sink of litter VOCs, absorbing up to 80% of VOCs released by litter, and exposure of soil to litter VOCs increased microbial respiration rates in soil by up to 15%. However, we observed negligible impacts of litter VOCs on soil nutrient levels and bacterial community structure, suggesting that soils must be exposed to higher concentrations of VOCs than observed in our study, to cause effects on these soil characteristics. Overall, VOCs appear to have an important influence on C dynamics at the soil-litter interface and VOC emissions from decomposing litter may represent an understudied component of biosphere-atmosphere interactions.
40343601|Unusually high SOC levels have been reported for sandy cropland soils in North-Western Europe. A potential link with their general heathland land-use history was investigated by comparing two soil pairs of relict heathland and cultivated former heathland in the Belgian sandy region. A sequential chemical fractionation yielded similar sizes in corresponding SOM fractions between the heathland and cropland soils (i.e. NaOCl resistant: 12.3-15.0 g C kg and NaOCl + HF resistant: 2.6-5.3 gC kg ). Higher amounts of clay sized N in the cropland plots can be attributed to N additions from mineral fertilizers and animal manure. Temperature resolved Pyrolysis Field Ionization Mass Spectroscopy analysis showed that the composition of both relict heathland and cultivated soils was surprisingly similar, in spite of over 60 years of intense cropland management. The mass spectra of SOM in both heathland-cropland soil pairs investigated was dominated by signals from lipids, alkylaromatics and sterols. The accumulation of this SOM rich in aliphatics was logically linked to the high input of lipids, longchain aliphatics and sterols from heathland vegetation and the low soil pH and microbial activity. Based on the relatively high OC surface loadings of HF-extractable OM(13-44 mg C m Fe and 1.2-2.3 mg C m clay), direct organo-mineral bonds between OM and Feoxides or clay minerals seem to be only partly involved as a stabilization mechanism in these soils. The distinct bimodal shape of the thermograms indicates that OM crosslinking could furthermore contribute substantially to SOM stabilization in these soils. This study therefore corroborates the previously proposed view that lipids may be bound in networks of alkylaromatics, the structural building blocks of OM macromolecules. We hypothesize that such binding is able to explain the measured retention of these OM components, even under several decades of cropland management.
20519836|The ability to predict stream alkalinity values over timescales shorter than monthly or annually is needed to understand the response of stream chemistry to acidic inputs which occur across short time scales (days). We develop and apply a coupled series of physically-based models which are able to predict daily stream alkalinity values by first calculating soil air CO concentrations. We apply the model to a 9 year record of discharge and stream chemistry from a small catchment in the Shenandoah National park of Virginia. We find that we are able to accurately predict the minimum daily stream alkalinity values for all years and we are able to accurately predict the entire annual cycle for 6 of the 9 years (Nash-Sutcliffe criterion equals 0.26). For the 3 years which we overpredict summer stream alkalinity, summer precipitation was greater than normal and much greater than the period for which the model was calibrated.
1469044| Measurements of denitrification using the acetylene inhibition, <sup>15</sup>N isotope tracer, and N<sub>2</sub> flux methods were carried out concurrently using sediment cores from Vilhelmsborg s, Denmark, in an attempt to clarify some of the limitations of each technique. Three experimental treatments of overlying water were used: control, nitrate enriched, and ammonia enriched water. The N<sub>2</sub> flux and <sup>15</sup>N tracer experiments showed high rates of coupled nitrification/denitrification in the sediments. The acetylene inhibition method did not capture any coupled nitrification/denitrification. This could be explained by acetylene inhibition of nitrification. A combined <sup>15</sup>N tracer/acetylene inhibition experiment demonstrated that acetylene inhibition of N<sub>2</sub>O reduction was incomplete and the method, therefore, only measured approximately 50% of the denitrification due to nitrate from the overlying water. Similar rates of denitrification due to nitrate in the overlying water were measured by the N<sub>2</sub> flux method and the acetylene inhibition method, after correcting for the 50% efficiency of acetylene inhibition. Rates of denitrification due to nitrate from the overlying water measured by the <sup>15</sup>N tracer method, however, were only approximately 35% or less of those measured by the acetylene inhibition or N<sub>2</sub> flux methods. 
1469231| The role of nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen cycle of the North Atlantic basin was re-evaluated because recent estimates had indicated a far higher rate than previous reports. Examination of the available data on nitrogen fixation rates and abundance of Trichodesmium, the major nitrogen fixing organism, leads to the conclusion that rates might be as high as 1.09  10<sup>12</sup> mol N yr<sup>-1</sup>. Several geochemical arguments are reviewed that each require a large nitrogen source that is consistent with nitrogen fixation, but the current data, although limited, do not support a sufficiently high rate. However, recent measurements of the fixation rates per colony are higher than the historical average, suggesting that improved methodology may require a re-evaluation through further measurements. The paucity of temporally resolved data on both rates and abundance for the major areal extent of the tropical Atlantic, where aeolian inputs of iron may foster high fixation rates, represents another major gap. 
1469780|Phosphorus (P) fractions were quantified in water samples collected on four occasions from sites at the lower tidal limit of seven Scottish East Coast rivers. Individual catchment characteristics ranged from those dominated by semi-natural land use to those where agriculture predominated. Together the rivers displayed attributes ranging from nearly pristine to those impacted by point and diffuse sources of pollutants. Sampling times were chosen to coincide with periods of low river flows where conditions should result in low concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) but favourable for phytoplankton growth. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were < 0.004 mg l<sup>-1</sup>, 0.005-0.048 mg l<sup>-1</sup> and 0.28-2.2 mg l<sup>-1</sup> for pristine, agricultural and point source impacted rivers respectively. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) represented from < 5% to > 90% of TP and dissolved P dominated all samples. The total phosphorus content (TPC) of SMP ranged from 0.1 to 1.1% and was significantly related to SRP. Organic matter was a significant component of SPM and organically bound phosphorus was the dominant form of particulate P. The C/P ratio of organic matter was wide, between 500-1200 for the more pristine systems which narrowed to < 400 for heavily impacted rivers. Exchangeable P increased during the summer but was generally a minor component of TP and therefore likely to be a significant source of SRP only in pristine rivers. Phytoplankton constituted between 5 and 46% of organic matter and concentrations of chlorophyll-a were significantly correlated with both TP and SRP.
40343743|Temporal evolution of dissolved and biogenic silica concentrations along the Scheldt tidal river and in its tributaries was investigated during 1 year in 2003. In the tributaries, dissolved silica (DSi) concentrations remained high and biogenic silica (BSi) concentrations were low throughout the year. In the tidal river during summer, DSi was completely consumed and BSi concentrations increased. Overall, most of the BSi was associated with living diatoms during the productive period in the tidal river. Nevertheless, the detrital BSi was a significant fraction of the total BSi pool, of which less than 10% could be attributed to phytoliths. The tidal river was divided into two zones for budgeting purposes. The highest productivity was observed in the zone that received the highest water discharge, as higher riverine DSi input fluxes induced presumably a less restrictive DSi limitation, but the discharge pattern could not explain all by itself the variations in DSi consumption. Silica uptake and retention in the tidal river were important at the seasonal time-scale: from May to September, 48% of the riverine DSi was consumed and 65% of the produced BSi was deposited, leading to a silica (DSi + BSi) retention in the tidal river of 30%. However, when annual fluxes were considered, DSi uptake in the tidal river amounted to 14% of the DSi inputs and only 6% of the riverine silica (DSi + BSi) was retained in the tidal river.
41490467|The tree island hammock communities in the Florida Everglades provide one of many examples of self-organized wetland landscape. However, little is understood about why these elevated tree island communities have higher nutrient concentration than the surrounding freshwater marshes. Here we used stable isotopes and elemental analysis to compare dry season water limitation and soil and foliar nutrient status in upland hammock communities of 18 different tree islands located in the Shark River Slough and adjacent prairie landscapes. We observed that prairie tree islands, having a shorter hydroperiod, suffer greater water deficits during the dry season than slough tree islands by examining shifts in foliar C values. We also found that prairie tree islands have lower soil total phosphorus concentration and higher foliar N/P ratio than slough tree islands. Foliar N values, which often increase with greater  availability, was also found to be lower in prairie tree islands than in slough tree islands. Both the elemental N and P and foliar N results indicate that the upland hammock plant communities in slough tree islands have higher amount of  available than those in prairie tree islands. Our findings are consistent with the transpiration driven nutrient harvesting chemohydrodynamic model. The water limited prairie tree islands hypothetically transpire less and harvest less p from the surrounding marshes than slough tree islands during the dry season. These findings suggest that hydroperiod is important to nutrient accumulation of tree island habitats.
1468704| In-situ partial pressures of hydrogen in anoxic profundal lake sediments reached values of up to 5 Pa which were more than 5 orders of magnitude lower than the partial pressures of methane. Analysis of gas bubbles collected from anoxic submerged paddy soil showed H<sub>2</sub> partial pressures in the range of 1.8  1.3 Pa being ca. 4 orders of magnitude lower than the CH<sub>4</sub> partial pressures. H<sub>2</sub> emission rates, on the other hand, were less than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates indicating that H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> were oxidized to a different extent in the rhizosphere of the soil before they reached the atmosphere, or that H<sub>2</sub> was produced by the plants. More than 70% of the emitted H<sub>2</sub> reached the atmosphere via plant-mediated flux. The rest was emitted via ebullition from the anoxic soil and, in addition, was produced in the paddy water. A significant amount of H<sub>2</sub> was indeed found to be produced in the water under conditions where thallic algae and submerged parts of the rice plants produced oxygen by photosynthesis. Very little H<sub>2</sub> was emitted via molecular diffusion through the paddy water; in addition, this amount was less than expected from the degree of supersaturation and the diffusional emission rate of CH<sub>4</sub> indicating a relatively high rate of H<sub>2</sub> consumption in the surface film of the paddy water. The total H<sub>2</sub> source strength of rice paddies and other freshwater environments was estimated to be less than 1 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup>, being negligible in the atmospheric budget of H<sub>2</sub>. 
41410581|The transport and deposition of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) to downwind ecosystems is significant and can be a dominant source of new N to many watersheds. Bacterially mediated denitrification in lake sediments may ameliorate the effects of N loading by permanently removing such inputs. We measured denitrification in sediments collected from lakes in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA) receiving elevated (5-8 kg N ha y) or low (<2 kg N ha y) inputs of atmospheric N deposition. The nitrate $(NO_3^ - )$ concentration was significantly greater in high-deposition lakes (11.3 mol l) compared to low-deposition lakes (3.3 umol l). Background denitrification was positively related to $(NO_3^ - )$ concentrations and we estimate that the sampled lakes are capable of removing a significant portion of N inputs via sediment denitrification. We also conducted a dose-response experiment to determine whether chronic N loading has altered sediment denitrification capacity. Under Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the maximum denitrification rate and half-saturation $(NO_3^ - )$ concentration did not differ between deposition regions and were 765 mol N m h and 293 mol l $(NO_3^ - )$ , respectively, for all lakes. We enumerated the abundances of nitrate-and nitrite-reducing bacteria and found no difference between high- and low-deposition lakes. The abundance of these bacteria was related to available light and bulk sediment resources. Our findings support a growing body of evidence that lakes play an important role in N removal and, furthermore, suggest that current levels of N deposition have not altered the abundance of denitrifying bacteria or saturated the capacity for sediment denitrification.
1468713| The chemical speciation of aluminum was examined in surface water samples from Sphagnum peatlands in north-central Minnesota, from peatlands along the Canadian east coast, and from bogs in the Pennine Mountain area of England. In highly organic ([DOC]  50 mg L<sup>-1</sup>), low pH waters, 80-90% of total dissolved Al was complexed with organic matter (OM), while in waters with low DOC ([DOC]  5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) 54-86% of total dissolved Al existed as Al<sup>+3</sup> or other inorganic Al species. Batch titrations of OM with Al revealed a high Al binding capacity, 1.4-2.8 mol (mg DOC)<sup>-1</sup>, that generally was unsaturated with Al. Titrations of OM with Al in conjunction with a continuous distribution model were used to determine Al-OM conditional stability constants. Binding capacity (mol Al (mg DOC)<sup>-1</sup>) and strength (formation constant) increased from pH 3 to 5 but decreased above pH 5 due to formation of Al-hydroxy species including Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>(s). The high binding capacity of OM in bog waters facilitates metal mobility, especially in low pH (< 5) wetlands where metal solubility is high and OM concentrations are highest. Results showed that the relative degree of organic matter saturation with metal ions was important in modeling Al speciation in bog waters. 
24715108|Although methanogenic pathways generally produce equimolar amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, CO concentrations are often reported to be higher than CH concentrations in both field and laboratory incubation studies of peat decomposition. In field settings, higher pore water concentrations of CO may result from the loss of methane by: (1) ebullition due to the low solubility of methane in pore water and (2) vascular-plant transport. Higher CO concentrations may also be caused by: (1) production of additional CO by high-molecular weight (HMW) organic matter (OM) fermentation and/or (2) respiration from non-methanogenic pathways. In this study of a peatland where advection and transverse dispersion were the dominant pore water solute transport mechanisms, an isotope-mass balance approach was used to determine the proportions of CO formed from non-fractionating OM respiration and HMW fermentation relative to CO production from methanogenesis. This approach also allowed us to estimate the loss of CH from the belowground system. The pathways of CO production varied with depth and surface vegetation type. In a Carex-dominated fen, methane production initially produced 40 % of the total CO and then increased to 90100 % with increasing depth. In a Sphagnum-dominated bog, methanogenesis resulted in 60 % of total CO production which increased to 100 % at depth. Both bogs and fens showed 85100 % of methane loss from pore waters. Our results indicate that the isotopic composition of dissolved CO is a powerful indicator to allow partitioning of the processes affecting peat remineralization and methane production.
1468929|Concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters of sub-humid to semi-arid lakes in east-central Alberta increase with increasing salinity and water residence time from about 20 to 330 mg L<sup>-1</sup> as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). This pattern is opposite to that observed among freshwater lakes spanning a gradient in water residence times, and is probably caused by evaporative concentration of refractory DOM. The proportion of total DOC, operationally defined as humic substances using XAD-8 resin, was high, though similar to surface waters typically referred to as "humic", and independent of salinity. Very long water residence times (hundreds of years) in saline lakes favors evapoconcentration of low-color, low molecular weight DOM, with N-content characteristic of allochthonous DOM.
40980889|In semi-arid floodplains the average times between floods have been cited to drive metabolic and biogeochemical responses during the subsequent flooding pulse. However, the interaction effects of flood pulse duration and the length of time between floods on the carbon budget are not well understood. Using field experiments, flood pulses dry cycles were simulated (SF plots short flood/dry cycles: 15 flood days + 7 dry + 15 flood and LF plots long flood/dry cycles: 21 flood + 14 dry + 21 flood) in a semi-arid floodplain in Central Spain, in order to study the effects on soil CO emissions. Differences on soil water content among SF, LF and control plots were statistically significant throughout the experiment (p < 0.01). Soil CO emission rates during drying time were significantly related with the duration of previous flooding and inter-flooding intervals (R = 0.52-0.64, p = 0.03). During the first stage of desiccation, the high soil water content appears to limit aerobic metabolism. Soil respiration rates similar to those of control plots measurements occurred 1-2 weeks later. Then, soil respiration increased to a maximum rate which was delayed 5-8 weeks, as high soil water content limited microbial activity. While more than 7 days of inundation promoted denitrification, organic nutrients supplied by flood water increased 1% soil respiration during drying. Differences between SF and LF plots in soil CO emissions only appeared after floodplain soil had been subjected to two consecutive flood-dry cycles; 70 days after the second inundation ended, CO fluxes achieved similar values in all treatments. Daily soil CO emission rates during the entire study period (117 days) were comparable, independently of the flood duration and the time between floods (75.76  1.59 and 77.94  0.45 mmol CO m day , in SF and LF, respectively). Flood disturbance affects site-specific microbial processes, but only during very short time periods. The mechanism by which soil microbial communities cope or adapt to new conditions needs to be reassessed in future research in order to determine the long-term effects of hydrological changes in the soil carbon balance of semi-arid floodplains.
20519889|Numerous studies have demonstrated exceptionally high temperature sensitivity of the beneath-snow respiratory flux in cold-winter ecosystems. The most common, but still untested, explanation for this high sensitivity is a physical one based on the observation that water availability in soils increases exponentially as soils warm from -3 to 0C. Here, we present evidence for a biological hypothesis to explain exponential kinetics and high Q values as beneath-snow soils from -3 to 0C during the early spring in a high-elevation subalpine forest. First, we show that some of the dominant organisms of the beneath-snow microbial community, "snow molds", exhibit robust exponential growth at temperatures from -3 to -0.3C. Second, Q values based on growth rates across the temperature range of -2 to -0.3C for these snow molds vary from 22 to 330. Third, we derive an analytical equation that combines the relative contributions of microbial growth and microbial metabolism to the temperature sensitivity of respiration. Finally, we use this equation to show that with only moderate snow mold growth (several generations), the combined sensitivities of growth and metabolism to small changes in beneath-snow soil temperature, create a double exponential in the Q function that may explain the extremely high ( 1  10) Q values observed in past studies. Our biological explanation for high Q levels is supported by several independent studies that have demonstrated build up of microbial biomass under the snow as temperatures warm from -2 to 0C.
41410558|Carbon (C) added to soil as organic matter in crop residues and carbon emitted to the atmosphere as CO in soil respiration are key determinants of the C balance in cropland ecosystems. We used complete and comprehensive county-level yields and area data to estimate and analyze the spatial and temporal variability of regional and national scale residue C inputs, net primary productivity (NPP), and C stocks in US croplands from 1982 to 1997. Annual residue C inputs were highest in the North Central and Central and Northern Plains regions that comprise ~70% of US cropland. Average residue C inputs ranged from 1.8 (Delta States) to 3.0 (North Central region) Mg C ha year and average NPP ranged from 3.1 (Delta States) to 5.4 (Far West region) Mg C ha year. Residue C inputs tended to be inversely proportional to the mean growing season temperature. A quadratic relationship incorporating the growing season mean temperature and total precipitation closely predicted the variation in residue C inputs in the North Central region and Central and Northern Plains. We analyzed the soil C balance using the crop residue database and the Introductory Carbon Balance regional Model (ICBMr). Soil C stocks (0-20 cm) on permanent cropland ranged between 3.07 and 3.1 Pg during the study period, with an average increase of ~4 Tg C year, during the 1990s. Interannual variability in soil C stocks ranged from 0 to 20 Tg C (across a mean C stock of 3.08  0.01 Pg) during the study period; interannual variability in residue C inputs varied between 1 and 43 Tg C (across a mean input of 220  19 Tg). Such interannual variation has implications for national estimates of CO emissions from cropland soils needed for implementation of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategies involving agriculture.

40343562|Failures in reforestation are often attributed to nutrient limitation for tree growth. We compared tree performance and nitrogen and phosphorus relations in adjacent mixed-species plantings of contrasting composition, established for forest restoration on Ultisol soil, originally covered by tropical semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest in Southeast Brazil. Nutrient relations of four tree species occurring in both planting mixtures were compared between a legume-dominated, speciespoor direct seeding mixture of early-successional species ("legume mixture"), and a species-diverse, legume-poor mixture of all successional groups ("diverse mixture"). After 7 years, the legume mixture had 6-fold higher abundance of N-fixing trees, 177% higher total tree basal area, 22% lower litter C/N, sixfold higher in situ soil resin-nitrate, and 40% lower in situ soil resin-P, compared to the diverse mixture. In the legume mixture, non-N-fixing legume Schizolobium parahyba (Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae) had significantly lower proportional N resorption, and both naturally regenerating non-legume trees had significantly higher leaf N concentrations, and higher proportional N resorption, than in the diverse mixture. This demonstrate forms of plastic adjustment in all three non-N-fixing species to diverged nutrient relations between mixtures. By contrast, leaf nutrient relations in N-fixing Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) did not respond to planting mixtures. Rapid N accumulation in the legume mixture caused excess soil nitrification over nitrate immobilization and tighter P recycling compared with the diverse mixture. The legume mixture succeeded in accelerating tree growth and canopy closure, but may imply periods of N losses and possibly P limitation. Incorporation of species with efficient nitrate uptake and P mobilization from resistant soil pools offers potential to optimize these tradeoffs.
1469979|A long-term field experiment was initiated to simulate chronic atmospheric N deposition, a widespread phenomenon in industrial regions of the world. Eight years of experimental nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) additions (3 g NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N m<sup>-2</sup> per year) to four different northern hardwood forests located along a 500 km geographic gradient dramatically increased leaching losses of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). During the last two water years, the average increase in solution NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N and DON leaching from the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-amended plots was 2.2 g N m<sup>-2</sup>, equivalent to 72% of the annual experimental N addition. Results indicate that atmospheric N deposition may rapidly saturate some northern hardwood ecosystems across an entire biome in the upper Great Lakes Region of the USA. Changes in soil C and N cycling induced by chronic N deposition have the potential in this landscape to significantly alter the flux of DOC and DON from upland to aquatic ecosystems. Michigan Gradient study site characteristics are similar to those of European forests most susceptible to N saturation.
1468780| In sedimentation areas of polluted rivers, microbial dechlorination of chlorinated aromatics may be of great environmental significance. This reaction may take place in the deeper, anaerobic sediment layers and involves replacement of a chlorine in the pollutant molecule by hydrogen. In this study, the microbial dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene in a sedimentation area of the Rhine River is evaluated by using Rhine water pollution data, concentrations in historical sediment samples and in recent sediment cores, and the results of anaerobic laboratory incubations with Lake Ketelmeer sediment. The various data support the conclusion that microbial dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene has occurred in the anaerobic sediment. Up to 80% of the hexachlorobenzene deposited in the early 1970s has been dechlorinated. The maximum half-life of hexachlorobenzene in the sediment is found to be 7 years. Two limitations of microbially mediated dechlorination in the natural environment have become clear. In the first place, a residual concentration of about 40 g/kg remains unaltered in the sediment or transformation rates of this fraction are at least extremely low. Secondly, the lower chlorinated benzenes that are produced from hexachlorobenzene appear to accumulate in the anaerobic sediment. 
20055233|We analyzed bioavailability, photoreactivity, fluorescence, and isotopic composition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) collected at 13 stations in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta during various seasons to estimate the persistence of DOC from diverse shallow water habitat sources. Prospective large-scale wetland restorations in the Delta may change the amount of DOC available to the food web as well as change the quality of Delta water exported for municipal use. Our study indicates that DOC contributed by Delta sources is relatively refractory and likely mostly the dissolved remnants of vascular plant material from degrading soils and tidal marshes rather than phytoplankton production. Therefore, the prospective conversion of agricultural land into submerged, phytoplankton-dominated habitats may reduce the undesired export of DOC from the Delta to municipal users. A median of 10% of Delta DOC was rapidly utilizable by bacterioplankton. A moderate dose of simulated solar radiation (286 W

40800593|Lakes and reservoirs (impoundments) are often viewed as a sink for nutrients within the river continuum. To date, most studies on nutrient retention within impoundments are derived from the temperate climate zones of Europe and North America, only consider one nutrient, and are often shortterm (1-2 years). Here, we present a long-term (17 year) data set and nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus and silica) budget for two connected semi-arid lakes (the Lower Lakes) at the terminus of the River Murray, Australia. Most of the filterable reactive phosphorus and nitrate entering the lakes were retained (77 and 92%, respectively). Total phosphorus (TP) was also strongly retained (55% of the annual TP load on average) and the annual TP retention rates could be predicted as a function of the areal hydraulic loading rate (annual lake outflow/lake surface area). On average, there was a slight net retention (7%) of the annual total nitrogen (TN) load but a slight net export (6% of the load) of organic N. TN retention as function of the areal hydraulic loading rate was lower than expected from existing models, possibly because of high nitrogen fixation rates in the Lower Lakes. Silica was retained (39%) at similar rates to those observed in previous studies. There was also a marked increase in the TN: TP and TN: Si ratios within the lake (TN: TP-30 and TN: Si~ 0.67) compared to those entering (TN: TP~ 15, TN: Si~ 0.45), as a consequence of the relatively low net retention of nitrogen.
1469374|In this study, we estimated whether changes in hydrological pathways during storms could explain the large temporal variations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) in the runoff of three catchments: a forest and a grassland sub-catchment of 1600 m2 delineated by trenches, and a headwater catchment of 0.7 km2. The average annual DOC export from the sub-catchments was 185 kg DOC ha-1 y-1 for the forest, 108 kg DOC ha-1 y-1 for the grassland and 84 kg DOC ha-1 y-1 for the headwater catchment. DON was the major form of the dissolved N in soil and stream water. DON export from all catchments was approximately 6 kg N ha-1 y-1, which corresponded to 60% of the total N export and to 50% of the ambient wet N deposition. DOC and DON concentrations in weekly samples of stream water were positively correlated with discharge. During individual storms, concentrations and properties of DOC and DON changed drastically. In all catchments, DOC concentrations increased by 6 to 7 mg DOC l-1 compared to base flow, with the largest relative increment in the headwater catchment (+350%). Concentrations of DON, hydrolysable amino acids, and phenolics showed comparable increases, whereas the proportion of carbohydrates in DOC decreased at peak flow. Prediction of DOC and DON concentrations by an end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) on the base of inorganic water chemistry showed that changes in water flow paths largely explained these temporal variability. According to the EMMA, the contribution of throughfall to the runoff peaked in the initial phase of the storm, while water from the subsoil dominated during base flow only. EMMA indicated that the contribution of the DOC and DON-rich topsoil was highest in the later stages of the storm, which explained the highest DOC and DON concentrations as the hydrograph receded. Discrepancies between observed and predicted concentrations were largest for the reactive DOC compounds such as carbohydrates and phenolics. They occurred at base flow and in the initial phase of storms. This suggests that other mechanisms such as in-stream processes or a time-variant release of DOC also played an important role.
20055189|To assess the relative influence of edaphoclimatic gradients and stand replacing disturbance on the soil respiration of Oregon forests, we measured annual soil respiration at 36 independent forest plots arranged as three replicates of four age classes in each of three climatically distinct forest types. Annual soil respiration for the year 2001 was computed by combining periodic chamber measurements with continuous soil temperature measurements, which were used along with site-specific temperature response curves to interpolate daily soil respiration between dates of direct measurement. Results indicate significant forest type, age, and type  age interaction effects on annual soil respiration. Average annual soil respiration was 1100-1600, 1500-2100, and 500-900 g C
1468576|We measured Al, Fe, and P fractions by horizon in two southern Appalachian forest soil profiles, and compared solution PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> removal in chloroform-sterilized and non-sterilized soils, to determine whether biological and geochemical P subcycles were vertically stratified in these soils. Because organic matter can inhibit Al and Fe oxide crystallization, we hypothesized that concentrations of non-crystalline (oxalate-extractable) Al (Al<sub>o</sub>) and Fe (Fe<sub>o</sub>), and concomitantly P sorption, would be greatest in near-surface mineral (A) horizons of these soils. Al<sub>o</sub> and Fe<sub>o</sub> reached maximum concentrations in forest floor and near-surface mineral horizons, declined significantly with depth in the mineral soil, and were highly correlated with P sorption capacity. Small pools of readily acid-soluble (AF-extractable) and readily-desorbable P suggested that PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> was tightly bound to Al and Fe hydroxide surfaces. P sorption in CHCl<sub>3</sub>-sterilized mineral soils did not differ significantly from P sorption in non-sterilized soils, but CHCl<sub>3</sub>-sterilization reduced P sorption 40-80% in the forest floor. CHCl<sub>3</sub>-labile (microbial) P also reached maximum concentrations in forest floor and near-surface mineral horizons, comprising 31-35% of forest floor organic P. Combined with previous estimates of plant root distributions, data suggest that biological and geochemical P subcycles are not distinctly vertically stratified in these soils. Plant roots, soil microorganisms, and P sorbing minerals all reach maximum relative concentrations in near-surface mineral horizons, where they are likely to compete strongly for PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> available in solution.
1468611|The fate of toluene in coastal seawater was investigated in controlled ecosystems using <sup>14</sup>C- and <sup>3</sup>H-toluene as tracers. Under winter-like conditions, 80% of the toluene volatilized from the water column in 2 months. Microbial degradation was less important than volatilization and sorption onto particulate matter with resultant loss to the sediments was minor. During summer most of the toluene was degraded by microbes. Nearly 80% of the toluene was converted to CO<sub>2</sub> within 1 week and the label remained in the water column as dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>. The experimental results were applied to estimate the removal rates and the residence time of toluene in adjacent Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. In winter volatilization would dominate the loss of toluene and a residence time of 6 d would be predicted. However, rapid biodegradation in summer would result in a residence time of < 1 d.
40343530|Different models for calculate on of dinitrogen fluxes using NO tracers were tested for their congruence with experimental data obtained with marine sediment samples. The co-occurence of nitrification as source of substrate and the simultaneous N production from denitrification and/or Anammox were taken into account as well as nitrous oxide production in the total denitrification rate. The results highlighted that isotope technique provides a powerful tool to evaluate, in the same experimental set up, the rates of total N fluxes: denitrification and/or Anammox if it is carefully applied and its limitations, mainly the range of NO inputs are adapted to the studied samples and the linearity of the kinetics of the products checked.
1469080|While "water quality function" is cited as an important wetland function to design for and preserve, we demonstrate that the scale at which hydrochemical samples are collected can significantly influence interpretations of biogeochemical processes in wetlands. Subsurface, chemical profiles for both nutrients and major ions were determined at a site in southwestern Wisconsin that contained areas of both natural and constructed wetlands. Sampling was conducted on three different scales: (1) a large scale (3 m between sampling points), (2) an intermediate scale (0.15 m between sampling points), and (3) a small scale (1.5 cm between sampling points). In most cases, significant vertical heterogeneity was observed at the 0.15 m scale, which was much larger than previously reported for freshwater wetlands and not detected by sampling water table wells screened over the same interval. However, profiles of ammonia and total phosphorus showed tenfold changes in the upper 0.2 meters of the saturated zone when sampled at the small (1.5 cm) scale, that was not depicted by sampling at the intermediate scale. At the intermediate scale of observation, one constructed wetland site differed geochemically from the natural wetlands and the other constructed wetland site due to application of off-site salvaged marsh surface and downward infiltration of rain. While important differences in dissolved inorganic phosphorus and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations existed between the constructed wetland and the natural wetlands, we also observed substantial differences between the natural wetland sites for these constituents. A median-polishing analysis of our data showed that temporal variations in constituent concentrations within profiles, although extensively recognized in the literature, were not as important as spatial variability.
1469571| The S cycle in the water column of a small, soft-water lake was studied for 9 years as part of an experimental study of the effects of acid rain on lakes. The two basins of the lake were artificially separated, and one basin was experimentally acidified with sulfuric acid while the other served as a reference or control. Spatial and seasonal patterns of sulfate uptake by plankton (53-70 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), deposition of sulfur to sediments in settling seston (53 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), and sulfate diffusion (0-39 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) into sediments were examined. Measurements of inputs (12-108 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and outputs (5.5-25 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) allowed construction of a mass balance that was then compared with rates of S accumulation in sediments cores (10-28 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and measured fluxes of S into the sediments. Because of the low SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations (mole L<sup>-1</sup>) in the lake, annual uptake by plankton (53-70 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) represented a large fraction (>50%) of the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> inventory in the lake. Despite this large flux through the plankton, only small seasonal fluctuations in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations (mole L<sup>-1</sup>) were observed; rapid mineralization of organic matter (half-life <3 months) prevented sulfate depletion in the water column. The turnover time for sulfate in the water column is only 1.4 yr; much less than the 11-yr turnover time of a conservative ion in this seepage lake. Sulfate diffusion into and reduction in the sediments (0-160 mole m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) caused SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> depletion in the hypolimnion. Modeling of seasonal changes in lake-water SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations indicated that only 30-50% of the diffusive flux of sulfate to the sediments was permanently incorporated in solid phases, and about 15% of sulfur in settling seston was buried in the sediments. The utility of sulfur mass balances for seepage lakes would be enhanced if uncertainty about the deposition velocity for both sulfate aerosols and SO<sub>2</sub>, uncertainty in calculation of a lake-wide rate of S accumulation in sediments, and uncertainty in the measured diffusive fluxes could be further constrained. 
1468803|Recently published annual mass balances or budgets for nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon in Chesapeake Bay have pictured the estuary as retaining a very large fraction, perhaps all, of the nutrients that enter from land drainage, the atmosphere, and anthropogenic discharges. However, these budgets have been based on estimates of the net exchanges of nutrients at the mouth of the bay or on the rates of accumulation of nutrients and sediments calculated from the distributions of various geochemical tracers in the sediments. While conceptually straightforward, the first approach is subject to large errors because it requires the determination of a small "signal" against a large background of tidal "noise". The second approach has led to overestimates of the nutrient trapping efficiency of the bay because tracer-derived sediment deposition rates have been multiplied by the surface area of the whole bay or various parts of the bay rather than by the smaller area of active sediment deposition. This approach is also incorrect because the average, long-term rates of sediment deposition measured by the geochemical tracers, including major floods, have been compared to shorter-term records of nutrient input. The more appropriate calculation of nutrient retention based on contemporaneous measurements of nutrient and sediment input and the chemical composition of sediments accumulated in the estuary shows that Chesapeake Bay retains only some 3-6% of the nitrogen, 11-17% of the phosphorus and 33-83% of the silicon brought into its waters during a year in which no major flood occurred. This behavior suggests that current problems of estuarine eutrophication are more a consequence of present nutrient inputs than an inevitable or inescapable legacy of past enrichment. It also follows that the management or manipulation of nutrient loadings to esturies may lead to a more rapid response in environmental quality than previously predicted.
41490503|The soil microbial biomass (SMB) is known to participate in key soil processes such as the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). However, its contribution to the isotopic composition of the SOM is not clear yet. Shifts in the C and N natural abundances of the SMB and SOM fractions (mineralised, water soluble and non-extractable) were investigated by incubating an unamended arable soil for 6 months. Microbial communities were also studied using Fatty Acid Methyl Ester specific isotope analysis. The SMB was significantly C and N-enriched relative to other fractions throughout the incubation. However, significant isotopic variations with time were also observed due to the rapid consumption of relatively C-enriched water soluble compounds. The increase in the difference in SMB and water soluble N compositions as the water soluble C/N ratio decreased, indicated a shift from N assimilation to N dissimilation during the incubation. These changes also induced modifications of the microbial community structure. Once the system reached a steady-state (after 1 month), the isotopic trends appeared to corroborate those obtained in long term experiments in the field in that there was a constant microbial isotopic fractionation leading to a C and N enrichment of the SOM over the long-term. This work also suggests that caution must be exercised when interpreting short term incubation studies since perturbations associated with experimental set-up can have an important effect on and N dynamics, microbial fractionation of C and N and microbial community structure.
1469786| The effects of oxygen conditions and temperature on dynamics of greenhouse gases (CH<sub>4</sub>,CO<sub>2</sub>,N<sub>2</sub>O) and nutrients (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>,NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>,tot-P) were studied in sediment of hyper-eutrophic Lake Kevtn, Finland. Undisturbed sediment cores were incubated at 6, 11, 16, and 23 C in a laboratory microcosm using a continuous water flow technique with an oxic or anoxic water flow. The production of CO<sub>2</sub> increased with increasing temperature in both oxic (Q<sub>10</sub> 3.2 0.6) and anoxic (Q<sub>10</sub> 2.3 0.4) flows. The release of CH<sub>4</sub> increased with temperature in anoxic conditions (Q<sub>10</sub> 2.3 0.2), but was negligible with the oxic flow at all temperatures. The release of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> increased with temperature with the oxic and anoxic flows (Q<sub>10</sub> 2.4 0.1). There was a net production of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and N<sub>2</sub>O with the oxic flow at temperatures below 16 C. The release of phosphorus was greater from the anoxic sediments and increased with temperature with both the anoxic (Q<sub>10</sub> 2.9 0.5) and oxic (Q<sub>10</sub> 1.9 0.1) flows. It is probable that the temperature of boreal lakes and the associated oxygen deficiency will increase as the climate becomes warmer. Our experiments showed that this change would increase the global warming potential of greenhouse gases released from sediments of eutrophic lakes predominately attributable to the increase in the CH<sub>4</sub> production. Furthermore, warming would also accelerate the eutrophication of lakes by increasing release of phosphorus and mineral nitrogen from sediments, which further enhance CH<sub>4</sub> production in sediments. 
24715195|The heterogeneity of DOM is closely linked with the various sources and the diversity of biogeochemical processes. We studied the spatial and temporal patterns of the quantity (bioavailable [B-] and refractory concentrations by laboratory incubations) and quality (C, aromaticity, and size-fraction by ultrafiltration [low molecular weight (LMW) < 1 kDa and high molecular weight (HMW) > 1 kDa]) of dissolved organic C (DOC), N (DON), and S (DOS) for surface waters (two upland streams, two wetland-affected streams, and lake outlet) over a 14-month period within the Arbutus Lake watershed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, USA. The % BDOC and % BDON of this watershed averages ranged from 6 to 18 % and from 12 to 43 %, respectively. The DOC and DON concentrations increased as water was transported through wetland areas of the Arbutus Lake watershed. DOC and DON constituents in the surface waters passing through a wetland were composed mostly of refractory HMW components (% HMWDOC: 55 %, % HMWDON: 60 %) with a higher level of aromaticity compared to upland streams (% HMWDOC: approximately 35 %, % HMWDON: approximately 30 %). DOS was dominated by the refractory (% BDOS range 613 %) and LMW (% LMWDOS range 6296 %) form and we suggest that bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction might play an important role in generating this distinct DOS biogeochemistry. The aromaticity was positively related to total DOC concentration, but negatively to % BDOC. Arbutus Lake DOM was dominated by bioavailable and LMW characteristics, compared to wetland-affected streams where refractory and HMW DOM fractions were more prevalent. Our study suggests the different variability of DOM characteristics among elements (C, N, S) using a "bioavailability-molecular size model" showing a diagenetic perspective due to the relative refractoriness of the LMW DOS. This study also highlights the importance of multiple approaches for understanding DOM biogeochemistry with respect to molecular size, bioavailability, aromaticity, stoichiometry, isotopic values, and elemental concentrations.
1469929|Reductions in snow cover under a warmer climate may cause soil freezing events to become more common in northern temperate ecosystems. In this experiment, snow cover was manipulated to simulate the late development of snowpack and to induce soil freezing. This manipulation was used to examine the effects of soil freezing disturbance on soil solution nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) chemistry in four experimental stands (two sugar maple and two yellow birch) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Soil freezing enhanced soil solution N concentrations and transport from the forest floor. Nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) was the dominant N species mobilized in the forest floor of sugar maple stands after soil freezing, while ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were the dominant forms of N leaching from the forest floor of treated yellow birch stands. Rates of N leaching at stands subjected to soil freezing ranged from 490 to 4,600 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, significant in comparison to wet N deposition (530 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and stream NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> export (25 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) in this northern forest ecosystem. Soil solution fluxes of P<sub>i</sub> from the forest floor of sugar maple stands after soil freezing ranged from 15 to 32 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>; this elevated mobilization of P<sub>i</sub> coincided with heightened NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> leaching. Elevated leaching of P<sub>i</sub> from the forest floor was coupled with enhanced retention of P<sub>i</sub> in the mineral soil Bs horizon. The quantities of P<sub>i</sub> mobilized from the forest floor were significant relative to the available P pool (22 mol ha<sup>-1</sup>) as well as net P mineralization rates in the forest floor (180 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Increased fine root mortality was likely an important source of mobile N and P<sub>i</sub> from the forest floor, but other factors (decreased N and P uptake by roots and increased physical disruption of soil aggregates) may also have contributed to the enhanced leaching of nutrients. Microbial mortality did not contribute to the accelerated N and P leaching after soil freezing. Results suggest that soil freezing events may increase rates of N and P loss, with potential effects on soil N and P availability, ecosystem productivity, as well as surface water acidification and eutrophication.
40647957|Studies on soil respiration in mountain forests are rather scarce compared to their broad distribution. Therefore, we investigated daily, seasonal and annual soil respiration rates in a mixed forest (Lgeren), located at about 700 m in the Swiss Jura mountains, during 2 years (2006 and 2007). Soil respiration (SR) was measured continuously with high temporal resolution (half-hourly) at one single point $(SR_{automated} )$ and periodically with high spatial resolution $(SR_{manual} )$ at 16 plots within the study site. Both, $SR_{automated} $ and $SR_{manual} $ showed a similar seasonal cycle. SR strongly depended on soil temperature in 2007 (R = 0.82-0.92), but less so in 2006 (R = 0.56-0.76) when SR was water limited during a summer drought. Including soil moisture improved the fit of the 2006 model significantly (R = 0.78-0.97). Total annual SR for the study site was estimated as 869 g C m year for 2006 and as 907 g C m year for 2007 (uncertainty <10% at the 95% confidence interval, determined by bootstrapping). Selected environmental conditions were assessed in more detail: (1) Rapid, but contrasting changes of SR were found after summer rainfall. Depending on soil moisture at pre-rain conditions, summer rain could either cause a pulse of CO from the soil or an abrupt decrease of $SR_{automated} $ due to water logging of soil pores. (2) Two contrasting winter seasons resulted in SR being about 60-70% (31.2-44.6 g C m) higher during a mild winter (2007) compared to a harsh winter (2006). (3) Analysing SR for selected periods on a diurnal scale revealed a counter-clockwise hysteresis with soil surface temperatures. This indication of a time-lagged response of SR to temperature was further supported by a very strong relationship (R= 0.86-0.90) of SR to soil temperature with a time-lag of 2-4 h.
40343532|The vertical distribution of various phosphorus (P) forms and their relation to physico-chemical properties of estuary sediment material were studied to better understand the potential release and burial of P. Core samples were taken from two dissimilar estuaries in the Baltic Sea: one in the Archipelago Sea (AS) and one in the Gulf of Finland (GoF). The P reserves were characterized by a sequential extraction procedure including the analysis of simultaneously dissolved elements in two extraction steps. The sediment material was also analysed for particle size distribution and total elements. In addition, several environmental variables were determined. The occurrence of the various forms of P varied with sediment depth among different sites. Reductant soluble, iron (Fe) bound P was the most dynamically changing P form in the sediment, while P bound to other metal oxides and apatite-P were the most stable fractions. High sedimentation rate was a dominating factor for sediment P burial. In addition, the content of organic matter, the amount of erosiontransported sorption components, and the oxygen (O) conditions in the near-bottom water were important determinants of the behaviour of sediment P. The results indicate that, over the long term, both estuaries have acted as sinks for deposited P and restricted the transport of P to the AS and the open GoF, thereby partly alleviating the eutrophication process.
20456575|Long term trends (1978-2005) of N-NO concentrations in river water were investigated for 10 rivers draining forested catchments in Piedmont, North-Western Italy, and Canton Ticino, Switzerland. All the river catchments come into the category of the medium-high stage of N saturation (levels 2-3 of the Stoddard's classification). The seasonal signal in N-NO concentrations and its changes in time over the course of the study period was also evaluated. Single trends were analysed for significance and magnitude; statistical techniques for the detection of common trends were then applied to identify a common pattern in the N-NO time series. Both the increasing NO levels and the limited seasonal pattern in recent years indicate an aggrading level of N saturation in time. Synchronous trends of N-NO export were found for 8 rivers. The main common trend was used to test relationships with: (i) temperature, (ii) precipitation, and (iii) N deposition. Step-changes in the data series were also assessed, and the main points of change are discussed in relation to meteorological factors and response to the N saturation status. Temperature proved to be the main factor affecting the temporal pattern of N-NO concentrations: warm periods were usually followed by an N-NO increase in river water due to enhanced mineralisation and nitrification in soil.
1468492| The proportion of total sulphur lost during combustion (600 C) of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) foliage is reduced from > 90% to 65-70% as the SO<sub>4</sub>-S concentration increases from < 10% to 45-50% of the total S content. Foliar SO<sub>4</sub>-S content is decreased by improvement of plant nitrogen status, suggesting that alterations to soil N availability may influence S transfer to the atmosphere during biomass burning. 
1469256| A solute mass balance for a 23.4 ha catchment of undisturbed rainforest in the central Amazon Basin was computed from detailed measurements of water and solute fluxes via rainfall, streamflow, and subsurface outflow over an annual cycle. Annual atmospheric deposition fluxes are lower than previously reported among mass balance studies conducted in the Amazon. Nutrient export fluxes are lower than previously reported for the Amazon, despite the fact that export fluxes via flow paths not previously measured were included. Given that climatic conditions were representative of a one in 10 wet year, the ecosystem was expected to show a net loss of nutrients rather than net gain. Instead, an excess of nutrient inputs via rainfall over ecosystem outflows was detected, ranging in annual quantities from 0.30 to 0.50 of the measured input. Among several mechanisms that could reconcile this budget, two are supported by the information presently available while two others cannot be evaluated without further research. Interannual variability in the amount of water available for runoff at the spatial scale of small catchments varies by a factor of two, in contrast to rainfall variability of 20%, and may be a critical control on the apparent changes in ecosystem storage detected by annual-scale nutrient budgets in rainforests. Entrainment of materials from the terrestrial ecosystem to the atmosphere, including particulates containing elements which do not exist as gases, may be a particularly important loss pathway in rainforests existing on deeply weathered or nutrient poor soils. 
41490537|Boreal peatlands have significant emissions of non-methane biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Climate warming is expected to affect these ecosystems both directly, with increasing temperature, and indirectly, through water table drawdown following increased evapotranspiration. We assessed the combined effect of warming and water table drawdown on the BVOC emissions from boreal peatland microcosms. We also assessed the treatment effects on the BVOC emissions from the peat soil after the 7-week long experiment. Emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, other reactive VOCs and other VOCs were sampled using a conventional chamber technique, collected on adsorbent and analyzed by GC-MS. Carbon emitted as BVOCs was less than 1% of the CO 2 uptake and up to 3% of CH emission. Water table drawdown surpassed the direct warming effect and significantly decreased the emissions of all BVOC groups. Only isoprene emission was significantly increased by warming, parallel to the increased leaf number of the dominant sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. BVOC emissions from peat soil were higher under the control and warming treatments than water table drawdown, suggesting an increased activity of anaerobic microbial community. Our results suggest that boreal peatlands could have concomitant negative and positive radiative forcing effects on climate warming following the effect of water table drawdown. The observed decrease in CH emission causes a negative radiative forcing while the increase in CO emission and decrease in reactive BVOC emissions, which could reduce the cooling effect induced by the lower formation rate of secondary organic aerosols, both contribute to increased radiative forcing.
20456587|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) plays an important role in surface water chemistry and ecology and trends in DOC concentration have been also associated with shifts in terrestrial carbon pools. Numerous studies have reported long-term trends in DOC concentration; however, some studies consider changes in average measured DOC whereas other compute discharge weighted concentrations. Because of differences in reporting methods and variable record lengths it is difficult to compare results among studies and make regional generalizations. Furthermore, changes in stream discharge may impact long-term trends in DOC concentration and the potentially subtle effect of shifts in stream flow may be missed if only measured DOC concentrations are considered. In this study we compare trends in volume-weighted vs. average measured DOC concentration between 1980 and 2001 at seven headwater streams in south-central Ontario, Canada that vary in wetland coverage and DOC (22-year mean vol. wt.) from 3.4 to 10.6 mg l. On average, annual measured DOC concentrations were 13-34% higher than volume-weighted values, but differences of up to 290% occurred in certain years. Estimates of DOC flux were correspondingly higher using measured concentration values. Both measured and volume-weighted DOC concentrations increased significantly between 1980 and 2001, but slopes were larger in measured data (0.04-0.35 mg l year compared with 0.05-0.15 mg l year) and proportional increases at the most wetland-influenced sites ranged from 32 to 43% in volume-weighted DOC and from 52 to 75% in measured DOC. In contrast, DOC flux did not change with time when estimated using either method, because of the predominant influence of stream flow on DOC export. Our results indicate that changes in stream flow have an important impact on trends in DOC concentration, and extrapolation of trend results from one region to another should be made cautiously and consider methodological and reporting differences among sites.
40343740|This paper aims at a synthesis of our conceptual views on the marine nutrient cycling. Based on selected biological", physical and geochemical aspects of the system, we present a framework for the description of the nitrogen cycling in oligotrophic regions of the ocean. Recent findings about the importance of the mesopelagic for remineralization are combined with ideas on the role of primary production, external input and fixation in nitrogen cycling. Instead of the usual distinction between euphotic and aphotic zones (i.e., with and without net primary production), our concept suggests a threelayer model featuring the subsurface production remineralization layer (SPRL) between the base of the surface mixed layer (SML) and the nutrient maximum at about 10001200 m depth, which can be used as a biogeochemical definition for the lower boundary of the mesopelagic. The approach leads to revised definitions of new and regenerated production, as well as export into the deep ocean, which are more adequate to characterize the biological pump, at least in the oligotrophic ocean. One of the main conclusions is that the steady state nitrogen export from the SPRL is fully determined by the sum of atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and N-fixation and can be best quantified at the depth of the nitrogen maximum. While the magnitude of primary production by nondiazotrophic phytoplankton is irrelevant for export into the deep ocean, biological processes are crucial in determining size, shape and density of sinking particles and the remineralization rate of detritus.
20519820|Human impact on nitrogen cycling, in particular the introduction of reactive nitrogen in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, can be examined at multiple scales, from the global impact on atmospheric chemistry to the impact of human activities on soil organic matter and fertility at the scale of square meters. Nevertheless, anthropogenic loading of nitrogen cycling in natural and managed ecosystems can be seen most directly at the regional scale, where concentrated human activity results in disruption of the nitrogen balance, with consequences for biogeochemical cycling and their interactions. Differences in land-use and agricultural practices between North and South America, and the importance of economic drivers that determine the fate of new reactive nitrogen demonstrate a contrasting picture of human impact on N cycling when the consequences are considered at the global vs. the regional scale. In particular, in the Pampa region of Argentina, the central agricultural zone of the country, the expansion of soybean cultivation in the last 20 years and the use of synthetic fertilizers have resulted in an influx of reactive nitrogen into these systems, with unexpected consequences for the nitrogen balance. A mass balance of nitrogen for soybean demonstrates that increased nitrogen inputs from biological fixation do not compensate for losses due to seed export, such that most areas under soybean cultivation are currently experiencing a substantive net loss of nitrogen. In addition, other crops that are currently being fertilized still show a net loss of nitrogen also due to the effect of primary exports from these agroecosystems. These simple models demonstrate that socioeconomic factors in large part drive the contrasting effects of anthropogenic impact on nitrogen cycling at global vs. regional scales. The future impact on nitrogen cycling in the Americas requires an integration of both ecological factors and socioeconomic drivers that will ultimately determine human disruption of the nitrogen cycle.
20519780|Eutrophication is a major agent of change affecting freshwater, estuarine, and marine systems. It is largely driven by transportation of nitrogen from natural and anthropogenic sources. Research is needed to quantify this nitrogen delivery and to link the delivery to specific land-derived sources. In this study we measured nitrogen concentrations and N values in seepage water entering three freshwater ponds and six estuaries on Cape Cod, Massachusetts and assessed how they varied with different types of land use. Nitrate concentrations and N values in groundwater reflected land use in developed and pristine watersheds. In particular, watersheds with larger populations delivered larger nitrate loads with higher N values to receiving waters. The enriched N values confirmed nitrogen loading model results identifying wastewater contributions from septic tanks as the major N source. Furthermore, it was apparent that N coastal sources had a relatively larger impact on the N loads and isotopic signatures than did inland N sources further upstream in the watersheds. This finding suggests that management priorities could focus on coastal sources as a first course of action. This would require management constraints on a much smaller population.
40343622|Intact sediment cores from rivers of the Bothnian Bay (Baltic Sea) were studied for denitrification based on benthic fluxes of molecular nitrogen (N) and nitrous oxide (NO) in a temperature controlled continuous water flow laboratory microcosm under 10, 30, 100, and 300 M of N enriched nitrate (NO, ~98 at. %). Effluxes of both N and NO from sediment to the overlying water increased with increasing NO load. Although the ratio of NO to N increased with increasing NO load, it remained below 0.04, N always being the main product. At the NO concentrations most frequently found in the studied river water (10-100 M), up to 8% of the NO was removed in denitrification, whereas with the highest concentration (300 M), the removal by denitrification was less than 2%. However, overall up to 42% of the NO was removed by mechanisms other than denitrification. As the microbial activity was simultaneously enhanced by the NO load, shown as increased oxygen consumption and dissolved inorganic carbom efflux, it is likely that a majority of the NO was assimilated by microbes during their growth. The N content in ammonium (NH) in the efflux was low, suggesting that reduction of NO to NH was not the reason for the NO removal. This study provides the first published information on denitrification and NO fluxes and their regulation by NO load in eutrophic high latitude rivers.
1469465|The importance of landscape geochemical flows was investigated using a dynamic model simulating carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in riverine wetlands, which has been described in a previous paper. The hydro-geomorphic unit (HGMU) concept was incorporated in the model by defining a separate, complete unit-model for each unit (HGMU) within the wetland. These unit-models were connected by defining the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus between them. These flows, also called landscape geochemical flows, usually consist of flows of water containing N and P. The model was applied to a site at Kismeldon Meadows, in south-western England. This site consists of two units, a slope and a floodplain, separated by a ditch, which catches most of the run off and shallow groundwater flows from the slope. Only an estimated 1% of the N and P that leaves the slope unit in the water outflow reaches the floodplain unit; the rest is caught in the system of ditches, which prevent the geochemical flows taking their natural course. To examine the influence of this system of ditches, the model was run for the same site, but without the ditches. This is comparable to a situation of a restored site, where run off and shallow groundwater flows containing nutrients, can freely get from the slope to the floodplain. The computer simulation experiment reconnecting the slope and floodplain showed that this (1) increased the nutrient input into the floodplain, causing a higher biomass production, and (2) increased the wetness of the floodplain, causing slower decomposition, which together (3) led to a faster soil organic matter accumulation in the floodplain. Nutrient inflows became relatively more important compared to atmospheric deposition, especially for phosphorus. By connecting the slope and the floodplain more nitrogen and less phosphorus flowed into the river.
1469912|In the frame of the BIOGEST project, the full transient, one-dimensional, reactive-transport model CONTRASTE has been extended for the computation of biogases in the Scheldt estuary. The CONTRASTE model (Coupled, Networked, Transport-Reaction Algorithm for Strong Tidal Estuaries) provides a satisfactory description of the estuarine residual circulation (including daily freshwater discharge and a complete description of the tide) and a flexible implementation of the various physico-chemical and biological transformations, including both kinetically-controlled and equilibrium reactions. The model allows resolution of the complex, nonlinear collective behaviour of this type of system and investigation of the non-steady-state phenomena which govern estuarine dynamics. Variables currently implemented in the model include salinity, suspended matter, oxygen, inorganic carbon species, degradable organic carbon and nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen species, freshwater and marine phytoplankton. Biological processes described are heterotrophic respiration, primary production, nitrification and denitrification. Equilibrium formulations allow for DIC and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>/NH<sub>3</sub> speciation. Physical processes include gas transfer at the water/air interface, depending on both wind speed and current velocity. pH profiles are explicitly computed and constitute a very sensitive check of the overall model consistency. Results of the CONTRASTE model are in very good agreement with the measured longitudinal distribution of the variables considered, in particular O<sub>2</sub>, pH, pCO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations. However, discrepancies are observed between the calculated fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> and those estimated using an in situ floating chamber. It is shown that the evaluation of gas transfer can be affected by serious errors if the variations due to changes in current velocity and water depth during one tidal cycle are not taken into consideration. The model also shows that the fluxes of biogases in estuaries are greatly influenced by the quasi-exponential increase of the exchange surface area with decreasing distance to the sea. Our estimation of the total daily flux of O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O is equal to +28500, -19000 and -17 kmoles.day<sup>-1</sup> respectively for the Scheldt estuary in July 1996.
1469155|The goals of sustainable food production and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions may be in conflict when green manures are used in flooded rice systems. A field study was initiated in early spring 1992 near Sacramento, California to quantify the potential for enhanced methane emissions following a green manure amendment to rice. Replicate flux measurements were made twice a day every 3-4 days throughout the growing season in four treatment plots: burned rice straw, spring incorporated rice straw, burned straw plus purple vetch and spring incorporated straw plus vetch. Seasonal methane emissions ranged from 66-136 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> and were 1.5 to 1.8 times higher from the straw plus vetch treatments relative to the straw only treatments. No significant differences in emissions were found between the two straw only treatments or the straw plus vetch treatments. Methane fluxes were exponentially related to soil temperature, but no effect of redox potential or floodwater depth were observed. The potential impact of these results on the global methane budget is discussed.
20519790|The effects of elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO on CH and NO emissions from rice soil were investigated in controlled-environment chambers using rice plants growing in pots. Elevated CO significantly increased CH emission by 58% compared with ambient CO. The CH emitted by plant-mediated transport and ebullition-diffusion accounted for 86.7 and 13.3% of total emissions during the flooding period under ambient level, respectively; and for 88.1 and 11.9% of total emissions during the flooding period under elevated CO level, respectively. No CH was emitted from plant-free pots, suggesting that the main source of emitted CH was root exudates or autolysis products. Most NO was emitted during the first 3 weeks after flooding and rice transplanting, probably through denitrification of NO contained in the experimental soil, and was not affected by the CO concentration. Pre-harvest drainage suppressed CH emission but did not cause much NO emission (&lt; 10 g N m h) from the rice-plant pots at both CO concentrations.
41490493|Deforestation changes the hydrological, geomorphological, and biochemical states of streams by decreasing evapotranspiration on the land surface and increasing runoff, river discharge, erosion and sediment fluxes from the land surface. Deforestation has removed about 55% of the native vegetation and significantly altered the hydrological and morphological characteristics of an 82,632 km watershed of the Araguaia River in east-central Brazil. Observed discharge increased by 25% from the 1970s to the 1990s and computer simulations suggest that about 2/3 of the increase is from deforestation, the remaining 1/3 from climate variability. Changes of this scale are likely occurring throughout the 2,000,000 km savannah region of central Brazil.
1468678|The pH of weak-acid solutions is controlled by acid concentration (HA+A<sup>-</sup>), the degree of acid dissociation (A<sup>-</sup>/HA), and the strength of the acids present (pK<sub>a</sub>). We developed an empirical approach that allows the relative importance of each of these factors to be estimated for soils. This empirical model was applied to soils collected from an old-field plantation of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) at 5 and 25 years of age. During this period, soil pH dropped by 0.3 to 0.8 units, and extractable calcium, magnesium and potassium declined by 20 to 80%. The empirical model indicates that the decline in pH resulted largely from the reduction in base saturation of the exchange complex. However, the average acid strength of the exchange complex decreased during the 20 years, preventing a greater decline of perhaps 0.1 to 0.2 units in the observed pH. The rate of decrease in the acid neutralizing capacity to pH 3.5 was about 1.3 kmol<sub>c</sub>/ha annually, while the increase in base neutralizing capacity was about 2.7 and 1.6 kmol<sub>c</sub>/ha annually to pH 5.5 and 8.2, respectively. Extractable alkali and alkaline earth cations declined by about 2.2 kmol<sub>c</sub>/ha annually, matched by the rate of increase in aluminium. These changes demonstrated the dynamic nature of poorly buffered soils, and indicated that changes in soil acidity may be expected over a period of decades (especially following changes in land-use).
1469620|Regular bi-weekly additions of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, equivalent to a rate of 3 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, were applied to cores of Sphagnum capillifolium, inhabiting hummocks and S. recurvum a pool and hollow colonizer, in a raised bog in north east Scotland. Microbial biomass C and N, both measured by chloroform extraction, showed similar seasonal patterns and, for most depths, the effects of added N on microbial biomass C and N changed with time. The addition of inorganic N had greatest effect during October when the water table had risen to the surface and microbial C and N in the untreated cores had decreased. Microbial C and N were maintained at 75 g C m<sup>-2</sup> and 8.3 g N m<sup>-2</sup> above the values in the untreated cores and far exceeded the amounts of N that had been added up to that date (1 g N m<sup>-2</sup>) as NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>. This increased microbial biomass was interpreted as leaching of carbonaceous material from the NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> treated moss resulting in greater resistance of the microbial biomass to changes induced by the rising water table. Treatment with N also caused significant reductions in extractable dissolved organic N (DON) at 10-15 cm depth, beneath the surface of the moss, but at lower depths to 25 cm no changes were observed. Extracted dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was not affected by N treatment and showed less seasonal variation than DON, such that the C:N ratio of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in all depths increased from approximately 4 in July to around 30 in December.
41410583|Organic matter decomposition regulates rates of carbon loss (CO and CH084) in wetlands and has implications for carbon sequestration in the context of changing global temperature. Here we determined the influence of temperature and vegetation type on both aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in subtropical wetland soils. As in many other studies, increased temperature resulted in higher rates of respiration and methanogenesis under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the positive effect of temperature depended on vegetation (source of carbon substrate to soil). Under anaerobic incubations, the proportion of gaseous C (CO and CH) lost as CH increased with temperature indicating a greater sensitivity of methanogenesis to temperature. This was further supported by a wider range of Q values (1.4-3.6) for methane production as compared with anaerobic CO (1.3-2.5) or aerobic CO (1.4-2.1) production. The increasing strength of positive linear correlation between CO: CH ratio and the soil organic matter ligno-cellulose index at higher temperature indicated that the temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis was likely the result of increased C availability at higher temperature. This information adds to our basic understanding of decomposition in warmer subtropical and tropical wetland systems and has implications for C models in wetlands with different vegetation types.
40343610|Rates of ebullition and composition of bubbles were measured along a nutrient-enriched segment of the South Platte River below Denver, Colorado. Ebullition was widespread in the South Platte up to 81 km downstream from Denver. Ebullitive fluxes of 0.44 and 0.29 g N m d were recorded at two sites downstream of Denver and represented 6-16% of the diffusive N efflux from this region. These data indicate that not accounting for ebullitive N losses can, at some locations, lead to a considerable underestimation of dentriflcation rates using the open-channel (gas exchange) method. Gas bubbles often were > 98% N methane dominated in a few organic-rich areas. Rates of ebullition related significantly to variations in temperature and dissolved organic carbon. Ebullition was not observed in four tributaries of the South Platte River, despite their moderate to high concentrations of nitrate and dissolved organic carbon. The data demonstrate that ebullition can contribute significantly to N effluxes in running waters exhibiting high rates of denitrification.
1469552|The effect of soil water content on efflux of CO<sub>2</sub> from soils has been described by linear, logarithmic, quadratic, and parabolic functions of soil water expressed as matric potential, gravimetric and volumetric water content, water holding capacity, water-filled pore space, precipitation indices, and depth to water table. The effects of temperature and water content are often statistically confounded. The objectives of this study are: (1) to analyze seasonal variation in soil water content and soil respiration in the eastern Amazon Basin where seasonal temperature variation is minor; and (2) to examine differences in soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions among primary forests, secondary forests, active cattle pastures, and degraded cattle pastures. Rates of soil respiration decreased from wet to dry seasons in all land uses. Grasses in the active cattle pasture were productive in the wet season and senescent in the dry season, resulting in the largest seasonal amplitude of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, whereas deep-rooted forests maintained substantial soil respiration during the dry season. Annual emissions were 2.0, 1.8, 1.5, and 1.0 kg C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for primary forest, secondary forest, active pasture, and degraded pasture, respectively. Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> were correlated with the logarithm of matric potential and with the cube of volumetric water content, which are mechanistically appropriate functions for relating soil respiration at below-optimal water contents. The parameterization of these empirical functions was not consistent with those for a temperate forest. Relating rates of soil respiration to water and temperature measurements made at some arbitrarily chosen depth of the surface horizons is simplistic. Further progress in defining temperature and moisture functions may require measurements of temperature, water content and CO<sub>2</sub> production for each soil horizon.
41490416|Phosphorus (P) is often a key limiting nutrient in freshwater systems, and excessive P can result in algal blooms, with flow-on effects to aquatic food webs. P sorption is an important process in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems whereby phosphate (PO) is exchanged between liquid and solid phases. This study shows that differences in the concentration of PO in a subtropical river system during high and low flow can be attributed to differences in P sorption characterises of its catchment soils and sediments. The sediments have lower Equilibrium Phosphate Concentrations (EPC) and higher binding energy (K d ); the surface soils have higher EPC and higher easily desorbed P (NHCI-P). A comparison of filterable reactive phosphorus (frP) in water samples collected at high and low flows, with soil and sediment EPC, suggested that during event flows, the high EPC and NHCl-P of surface soils is producing a net movement of PO from the soil/sediment system into runoff and stream flow. At baseflow, there is more likely a net movement of PO into the riverbed sediments. This has important implications for management actions aimed at reducing P loads to river systems and downstream water storages, namely the need to increase the infiltration of rainfall to decrease the amount of PO being flushed from the surface soil.
41490446|Terrestrial organic matter (TOM) plays a key role in mercury (Hg) dynamics between watersheds and lakes. In this study we attempts to determine the role of TOM source and quality and not only quantity, in the fate and transport of total Hg (T-Hg) to boreal lakes. Integrating the watershed complexity is a daunting task. Within the scope of this project, we characterized this organic matter at a molecular level in order to determine Hg transfer conditions to the sediments. We sampled ten lakes in the Quebec boreal forest. In each lake, we took a sediment core at the deepest point in addition to analyzing T-Hg and a set of terrigenous biomarkers in recent sediments. Our results show no relationship between TOM quantity and T-Hg concentration in lake sediments. However, [T-Hg] variation is well explained by the increase of 3,5Bd/V ratios (R = 0.84; p < 0.0002) and the decrease of C/V ratios (R = 0.5; p < 0.0227). Our study shows that TOM source and quality are determinant for Hg loadings in lake sediments. More precisely, increasing TOM derived from humified soil horizons explains most of Hg level variation within sediments.
20055201|The dynamics of the nutrient pools and their stoichiometry as well as their control by ecosystem metabolism (benthic and planktonic) and benthic--pelagic exchanges (sedimentation rates and sediment waterfluxes) were examined in the Mediterranean littoral (Blanes Bay, NE Spain). Dissolved organic nitrogen comprised about half of the nitrogen present in the water column and the carbon pool was dominated by the inorganic pool (95% of the carbon present in the water column). The dissolved and particulate organic pools were deficient in P relative to C and N, indicating a rapid recycling of P from organic matter. The pelagic compartment was heterotrophic, supported by significant allochthonous inputs of land material, which also contributed greatly to the sedimentary inputs (37% of total sedimenting carbon). In contrast, the benthic compartment was autotrophic, with the excess net benthic community production balancing the deficit in pelagic community production, leading to metabolic equilibrium at the station studied. Sedimentary inputs of nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon exceeded the benthic release, indicating that the benthic compartment acted as a sink for nutrient, consistent with its autotrophic nature. Carbon inputs to the benthic compartment also exceeded requirements, due to the allochthonous subsidies to the system, so that the benthic compartment stored or exported organic carbon.
20055288|Study included seven soils, an adjacent spring and brook and was conducted to estimate CH source and sink strengths of forest soils along a wetness gradient, i.e. their exchange with atmosphere (direct emission), and hydrosphere (indirect emission). Soils are represented by anaerobic Histosol, oxic Cambisols, Histosol with degraded peatlayers and Gleysols having intermediate redox state. They could be separated into three emission groups: CH emitting (248-318 kg C
24715328|Organic carbon (C) associated with fine soil particles (<20 m) is relatively stable and accounts for a large proportion of total soil organic C (SOC). The soil C saturation concept proposes a maximal amount of SOC that can be stabilized in the fine soil fraction, and the soil C saturation deficit (i.e., the difference between current SOC and the maximal amount) is presumed to affect the capacity, magnitude, and rate of SOC storage. In this study, we argue that predictions using current models underestimate maximal organic C stabilization of fine soil particles due to fundamental limitations of using least-squares linear regression. The objective was to improve predictions of maximal organic C stabilization by using two alternative approaches; one mechanistic, based on organic C loadings, and one statistical, based on boundary line analysis. We collected 342 data points on the organic C content of fine soil particles, fine particle mass proportions in bulk soil, dominant soil mineral types, and land use types from 32 studies. Predictions of maximal organic C stabilization using linear regression models are questionable because of the use of data from soils that may not be saturated in SOC and because of the nature of regression itself, resulting in a high proportion of presumed samples. samples. Predictions of maximal organic C stabilization using the organic C loading approach fit the data for soils dominated by 2:1 minerals well, but not soils dominated by 1:1 minerals; suggesting that the use of a single value for specific surface area, and therefore a single organic C loading, to represent a large dataset is problematic. In boundary line analysis, only data representing soils having reached the maximal amount (upper tenth percentile) were used. The boundary line analysis estimate of maximal organic C stabilization (78  4 g C kg fraction) was more than double the estimate by the linear regression approach (33  1 g C kg fraction). These results show that linear regression models do not adequately predict maximal organic C stabilization. Soil properties associated with soil mineralogy, such as specific surface area and organic C loading, should be incorporated to generate more mechanistic models for predicting soil C saturation, but in their absence, statistical models should represent the upper envelope rather than the average value.
24715184|Elevated and chronic nitrogen (N) deposition to N-limited terrestrial ecosystems can lead to 'N saturation', with resultant ecosystem damage and leaching of nitrate (NO) to surface waters. Presentday N deposition, however, is often a poor predictor of NO leaching, and the pathway of the ecosystem transition from N-limited to N-saturated remains incompletely understood. The dynamics of N cycling are intimately linked to the associated carbon (C) and sulphur (S) cycles. We hypothesize that N saturation is associated with shifts in the microbial community, manifest by a decrease in the fungi-to-bacteria ratio and a transition from N to C limitation. Three mechanisms could lead to lower amount of bioavailable dissolved organic C (DOC) for the microbial community and to C limitation of N-rich systems: (1) Increased abundance of N for plant uptake, causing lower C allocation to plant roots; (2) chemical suppression of DOC solubility by soil acidification; and (3) enhanced mineralisation of DOC due to increased abundance of electron acceptors in the form of SO and NO in anoxic soil micro-sites. Here we consider each of these mechanisms, the extent to which their hypothesised impacts are consistent with observations from intensively-monitored sites, and the potential to improve biogeochemical models by incorporating mechanistic links to the C and S cycles.
40647947|Solute yields, laboratory dissolution data and both chemical and isotopic markers of rock weathering reactions are used to characterise the biogeochemistry of glacial meltwaters draining a maritime Antarctic glacier. We find that delayed flowpaths through ice-marginal talus and moraine sediments are critical for the acquisition of solute from rock minerals because delayed flowpaths through subglacial sediments are absent beneath this small, cold-based glacier. Here the mechanisms of weathering are similar to those reported in subglacial environments, and include sub-oxic conditions in the early summer and increasingly oxic conditions thereafter. Up to 85% of the NO "and 65% of the SO "are most likely produced by bacterially mediated reactions in these ice marginal sediments. However, reactive pyrite phases are sparse in the host rocks, limiting the export of Fe, SO and cations that may be removed by weathering once pyrite oxidation has taken place. This means that dissolution of Ca and Na from carbonate and silicate minerals dominate, producing moderate cationic denudation yields from Tuva Glacier (163 * meq m a) compared to a global range of values (94-4,200 * meq km a). Overall, crustally derived cations represent 42% of the total cationic flux, the rest being accounted for by snowpack sources.
1469026|Based on data from three German forest ecosystems severely disturbed by windthrow events, correlation patterns between NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> dynamics in the soil solution are described. Each of the correlation types was related to site-specific SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> retention processes. The relative importance of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption/desorption and precipitation/dissolution was found to be different for the studied soils depending on their contents of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-adsorbing sesquioxides and of Al hydroxy sulfate minerals. Enhanced NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in the soil solution resulting from excess nitrification promoted either SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption or the dissolution of Al hydroxy sulfates. Both processes result in different ecological consequences: Whereas the former reaction reduces anion concentration peaks in the soil solution, the latter increases them. Thus, a prediction of cation export from soil ecosystems subjected to excess nitrification has to regard site-specific interrelationships between NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. As a third type of correlation the independence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in the soil solution is presented. This type is suggested to be typical for soils with low SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption capacity and absence of Al hydroxy sulfates.
1469703| I investigated controls of stream dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) sources and cycling along a stream size and productivity gradient in a temperate forested watershed in northern California. Dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub>) dynamics in heavily shaded streams contrasted strongly with those of larger, open canopied sites. In streams with canopy cover > 97%, CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> was highest during baseflow periods (up to 540 M) and was negatively related to discharge. Effects of algal photosynthesis on CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> were minimal and stream CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> was primarily controlled by groundwater CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> inputs and degassing losses to the atmosphere. In contrast to the small streams, CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> in larger, open-canopied streams was often below atmospheric levels at midday during baseflow and was positively related to discharge. Here, stream CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> was strongly influenced by the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. Dynamics of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were less complex. HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> were positively correlated, negatively related to discharge, and showed no pattern with stream size. Stable carbon isotope ratios of DIC (i.e.  <sup>13</sup>C DIC) increased with stream size and discharge, indicating contrasting sources of DIC to streams and rivers. During summer baseflows,  <sup>13</sup>C DIC were <sup>13</sup>C-depleted in the smallest streams (minimum of -17.7) due to the influence of CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> derived from microbial respiration and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> derived from carbonate weathering.  <sup>13</sup>C DIC were higher (up to -6.6) in the larger streams and rivers due to invasion of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> enhanced by algal CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> uptake. While small streams were influenced by groundwater inputs, patterns in CO<sub>2 (aq)</sub> and evidence from stable isotopes demonstrate the strong influence of stream metabolism and CO<sub>2</sub> exchange with the atmosphere on stream and river carbon cycles. 
41490514|The eutrophication status of the entire Baltic Sea is classified using a multi-metric indicator-based assessment tool. A total of 189 areas are assessed using indicators where information on reference conditions (RefCon), and acceptable deviation (AcDev) from reference condition could be combined with national monitoring data from the period 2001-2006. Most areas (176) are classified as 'affected by eutrophication' and only two open water areas and 11 coastal areas are classified as 'unaffected by eutrophication'. The classification is made by application of the recently developed HELCOM Eutrophication Assessment Tool (HEAT), which is described in this paper. The use of harmonized assessment principles and the HEAT tool allows for direct comparisons between different parts of the Baltic Sea despite variations in monitoring activities. The impaired status of 176 areas is directly related to nutrient enrichment and elevated loads from upstream catchments. Baltic Sea States have implemented nutrient management strategies since years which have reduced nutrient inputs. However, eutrophication is still a major problem for large parts of the Baltic Sea. The 2007 Baltic Sea Action Plan is projected to further reduce nutrient inputs aiming for a Baltic Sea unaffected by eutrophication by 2021.
24715345|Understanding the main and interactive effects of chronically altered resource availability and disturbance on phosphorus (P) availability is increasingly important in light of the rapid pace at which human activities are altering these processes and potentially introducing P limitation. We measured P pools and fluxes in eighteen mixed forest stands at three elevations (low, mid, high) subjected to increasing atmospheric N deposition, where hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) was absent or declining due to infestation by the exotic hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). While total soil P was similar across the study area, phosphorus fractionation revealed distinct differences in the distribution of soil P fractions as elevation and N availability increased. Soils from high elevation plots where N availability was greatest had 139 % larger organic P pools and 55 % smaller residual and refractory P pools than soils from low elevation plots with less N availability, suggesting that increased N availability has driven the depletion of recalcitrant P pools by stimulating biotic demand and sequestration. These differences in P distribution among fractions influenced how tree mortality affected P dynamics. At high elevations, plots containing declining hemlocks had significantly greater foliar P concentrations and fluxes of P from the forest floor than reference plots at similar elevations, whereas at low and mid-elevations there were no consistent differences between plots. Across all elevation classes, hardwood foliar N:P ratios were lower in plots with declining hemlocks. Collectively, these results suggest that increased N availability enhances bioavailable P, which is sequestered in vegetation until disturbances liberate it.
1469359| Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), humic substances (HS), polysaccharides (PS) and low molecular weight acids (LMWA) were characterized in water from the dystrophic Lake Groe Fuchskuhle over a period of seven months. In addition, porewater from an adjacent fen was investigated in order to obtain information about the DOC in the catchment area. Size-exclusion-chromatography combined with UV- and organic carbon (IR)-detection was used to quantify DOC and its fractions. The lake had previously been divided into four separate sections by large sheets of plastic, and the DOC composition differed markedly between the four compartments. Spatial variations in HS and PS concentrations were greater than seasonal variations. The high amounts of HS (up to 58%) in the western sections of the lake, indicated influence by subsurface water from the fen, whereas the eastern sections were dominated by PS (up to 35%) of algal origin. These differences could be explained by hydrological conditions, indicating that completely different catchment areas influenced the water chemistry in the separate compartments. By characterizing the HS by their average molecular weight and their aromaticity, three different groups of HS could be distinguished depending on their origin and fate. Microbial degradation of DOC and its fractions differed between two of the compartments during incubation studies over a period of six weeks. 
1469417|Understanding interactions between permanently frozen soils and stream chemistry is important in predicting the effects of management, natural disturbance and changing permafrost distribution on stream ecosystems and nutrient budgets in subarctic watersheds. Chemical measurements of groundwater, soil water and stream water were made in two watersheds in the taiga of interior Alaska. One watershed (HiP) had extensive permafrost and the other (LoP) had limited permafrost. Soil water collected within the rooting zone (0.3-0.5 m) in both watersheds was high in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) but low in dissolved minerals (dominantly Ca, Mg and Na) and conductivity. The reverse was true for groundwater from springs and wells. Permafrost in the HiP basin prevented deep percolation of water and generated stormflows rich in DOC. The presence of permafrost in HiP resulted in higher fluxes of DOC, DON and DIN into stream water from upland soils.
41410599|Despite methylmercury (MeHg) production in boreal wetlands being a research focus for decades, little is known about factors in control of methylation and demethylation rates and the effect of wetland type. This is the first study reporting potential Hg methylation (k m ) and MeHg demethylation rate constants (k d ) in boreal wetland soils. Seven wetlands situated in northern and southern Sweden were characterized by climatic parameters, nutrient status (e.g. type of vegetation, pH, C/N ratio, specific UV-absorption), iron and sulfur biogeochemistry. Based on nutrient status, the wetlands were divided into three groups; (I) three northern, nutrient poor fens, (II) a nutrient gradient ranging from an ombrotrophic bog to a fen with intermediate nutrient status, and (III) southern, more nutrient rich sites including two mesotrophic wetlands and one alder (Alnus) forest swamp. The k m /k d ratio in general followed %MeHg in soil and both measures were highest at the fen site with intermediate nutrient status. Northern nutrient poor fens and the ombrotrophic bog showed intermediate values of %MeHg and k m /k d . The two mesotrophic wetlands showed the lowest %MeHg and k m /k d , whereas the alder swamp had high k m and k d , resulting in an intermediate k m /k d and %MeHg. Molybdate addition experiments suggest that net MeHg production was mainly caused by the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria. A comparison with other studies, show that k m and %MeHg in boreal freshwater wetlands in general are higher than in other environments. Our results support previous suggestions that the highest MeHg net production in boreal landscapes is to be found in fens with an intermediate nutrient status.
20055278|Absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in aquatic ecosystems is primarily controlled by dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The role of iron (Fe) has also been suggested to contribute to UVR attenuation either directly or by interactions with DOC. Here we present findings from three laboratory manipulations of Fe and DOC on changes to the dissolved UVR absorption (
24716784|Stream chemistry in permafrost regions is regulated by a variety of drivers that affect hydrologic flowpaths and watershed carbon and nutrient dynamics. Here we examine the extent to which seasonal dynamics of soil active layer thickness and wildfires regulate solute concentration in streams of the continuous permafrost region of the Central Siberian Plateau. Samples were collected from 2006 to 2012 during the frost-free season (MaySeptember) from sixteen watersheds with fire histories ranging from 3 to 120 years. The influence of permafrost was evident through significantly higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the spring, when only the organic soil horizon was accessible to runoff. As the active layer deepened through the growing season, water was routed deeper through the underlying mineral horizon where DOC underwent adsorption and concentrations decreased. In contrast, mean concentrations of major cations (Ca > Na > Mg > K) were significantly higher in the summer, when contact with mineral horizons in the active zone provided a source of cations. Wildfire caused significantly lower concentrations of DOC in more recently burned watersheds, due to removal of a source of DOC through combustion of the organic layer. An opposite trend was observed for dissolved inorganic carbon and major cations in more recently burned watersheds. There was also indication of talik presence in three of the larger watersheds evidenced by Cl concentrations that were ten times higher than those of other watersheds. Because climate change affects both fire recurrence intervals as well as rates of permafrost degradation, delineating their combined effects on solute concentration allows forecasting of the evolution of biogeochemical cycles in this region in the future.
20055218|Relationships among soil phosphorus distribution, soil organic carbon and biogeochemistry of iron and aluminum were studied along a flooded forest gradient of the Mapire river, Venezuela. Soil samples were collected during the dry season in three zones subjected to different flooding intensity: MAX inundated 8 months per year, MED inundated 5 months per year, and MIN inundated 2 months per year. Total labile phosphorus (resin + bicarbonate extractable fractions) was significantly higher in MIN than in MAX. The longer non-flooding period in MIN probably allowed a higher accumulation of microbial biomass in soils of this zone and consequently a greater release of the bicarbonate organic fraction. The moderately labile phosphorus fraction associated with the chemisorbed phosphorus on amorphous and some crystalline aluminum and iron was significantly lower in MAX than in MIN following the same tendency observed for crystalline iron oxides. This result allowed us to hypothesize that the combined effect of a long flood period and a high soil organic carbon content in the MAX, could be appropriate conditions for microbial reduction of stable forms of iron. The ratio of soil organic carbon to total organic phosphorus decreased from MAX to MIN, indicating higher mineralization of organic phosphorus in MIN. Our results suggests two distinct flood-dependent mechanisms operating for phosphorus release along the gradient. In MAX mineralization process appears to be limited, while microbial mineral dissolution appears to be an important source of phosphorus. In MIN supply of phosphorus is associated with the stability of soil organic matter.
1468569|Inorganic-N concentrations in soil solution of whole tree harvest (WTH) and conventional fell (CF) plots were monitored for two years before felling and four years after felling. Concentrations in the mineral soil after felling were higher than in standing forest for up to 14 months in both felling treatments. In the WTH plots inorganic-N concentrations then dropped steadily until four years after felling they approached zero. In contrast, inorganic-N concentrations of the CF plots remained comparatively large. Inorganic-N was dominated by nitrate throughout the period of the study, and especially in the mineral horizons. Felling debris was not a source of inorganic-N, unless indirectly through release and mineralisation of soluble organic-N. Vegetation cover, biomass and N content were substantially greater in the WTH plots two to three years after felling, compared with the CF. Vegetation cover and brash cover (slash cover in N. America) were negatively correlated. There was also a negative correlation between inorganic-N concentration in soil water samplers and the vegetation cover within the collection area of, or a 1 m square surrounding, these samplers. Two factors are probably responsible for the reduction in inorganic-N concentrations after felling in the WTH -- the rapid re-establishment of vegetation and the lack of a N source in felling debris. In the CF plots, brash prevents re-establishment of vegetation over wide areas for at least four years. However, brash is not directly a source of inorganic-N at this stage.
1468634|A simulation model of S, P and N cycling in pastures was constructed as a conceptual and predictive tool to examine a range of possible fertilizer managements for improved pastures on the Northern Tablelands of N.S.W.. The model successfully simulated pasture yield and clover content for a four-year superphosphate trial. It was used to calculate C and S fluxes between various pools for pastures with and without fertilizer S. Under a non-limiting P regime, which was S deficient, the model predicted a 3.6-fold increase in tops growth due to S fertilization, a 13-fold increase in sheep liveweight gain, and a 5-fold increase in wool production. These effects were due to a greater proportion of assimilate contributing to tops growth, and a much higher proportion of clover in the diet.
1468599|The Regional Integrated Lake-Watershed Acidification Study (RILWAS) was conducted to identify and to quantify the environmental factors controlling surface water chemistry in forested watersheds of the Adirondack region of New York. The RILWAS vegetation research was designed to: (1) compare the quantitative patterns of forest cover and tree community structure in the study catchments of the Moose River drainage system; and (2) identify important vegetation differences among study watersheds that might help to explain inter-watershed differences in water chemistry and aquatic responses to acidic deposition. Field transect data indicated that the overall drainage system includes 50% mixed forest cover, 38% hardwood forest, 10% coniferous forest, and 2% wetland cover. Major tree species include yellow birch, red spruce, American beech, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and red maple. Analysis of forest structure indicated that mean weighted basal area estimates ranged two-fold from 24-48 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> among watersheds. Likewise, mean weighted estimates for aboveground biomass and aboveground annual productivity ranged among watersheds from 160 to 320 MT ha<sup>-1</sup> and from 8 to 18 MT ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Results showed that differences in surface water chemistry were independent of vegetation differences among watersheds.
1469544|We used the Century model to evaluate environmental controls over ecosystem development during the first 3500 y of primary succession on pahoehoe (i.e., relatively smooth, solid) lava flows of wet, windward Mauna Loa, Hawaii. The Century model is a generalized ecosystem model that simulates carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics for plant-soil systems. Preliminary results indicated the need to modify the model to include the effects of soil C accumulation on soil water storage and drainage. The modified model was parameterized to simulate observed values of aboveground productivity, biomass and soil element pools on a 3400-y-old site at 700 m elevation. Testing the model parameters at 1660 m elevation indicated that N inputs were lower and soil water drainage rates were slower at the higher elevation. We applied the modified and fully parameterized model to simulate ecosystem attributes during primary succession at five elevations, and conducted single-factor experiments with the model to identify the specific influences of variations in temperature, nutrient inputs, and rainfall on modeled ecosystem characteristics. Simulated aboveground productivity (ANPP), net N and P mineralization, and biomass element pools all increased through time at each elevation, and all declined with increasing elevation at each point in time. After 3500 y of succession none of these attributes had reached a stable asymptote, but asymptotes were approached more quickly, and succession was therefore faster, at lower than at higher elevations. Simulated soil organic matter (SOM) pools increased with elevation, despite that plant productivity declined. These results, and similar comparisons among rainfall regimes, suggest that SOM pools were more sensitive to factors controlling decay than production rates. Within elevations and temperature regimes, nutrient availability was the most important factor controlling simulated rates of plant productivity, biomass, and detritus accumulation during ecosystem development. Through time, SOM accumulations alleviated nutrient limitations to plants, but simulated productivity remained highly dependent upon externally supplied nutrients even after 20,000 y. Rainfall had two main effects on nutrient availability within the model: (1) it increased rates of leaching, and thus depleted nutrient supplies; and (2) it exacerbated soil flooding and thereby decreased nutrient turnover rates. High rainfall on windward Mauna Loa maintains oligotrophic conditions through time despite continuous N and P inputs.
1468864|Above ground net primary production (NPP), nitrogen (N) allocation, and retranslocation from senescing leaves were measured in 7 sugar-maple dominated sites having annual net N mineralization rates ranging from 26 to 94 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The following responses were observed: (1) Green sun leaves on richer sites had higher N mass per unit leaf area than sun leaves on poorer sites; (2) Total canopy N varied much less than annual net mineralization, ranging from 81 to 111 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>; (3) This was due to the existence of a large and relatively constant pool of N which was retranslocated from senescing leaves for use the following year (54 to 80 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>); (4) The percentage of canopy N retranslocated by sugar maple was also relatively constant, but was slightly higher on the richer sites. Percent N in leaf litter did not change across the gradient; (5) Above ground NPP increased linearly in relation to N allocated above ground. Therefore, N use efficiency, expressed as above ground NPP divided by N allocated above ground was constant; (6) N use efficiency expressed as (NPP above ground/total N availability) was a curvilinear function of N availability; and (7) This pattern reflected a decreasing apparent allocation of N below ground with decreasing N availability.
1468808|Solid-state cross-polarisation/magic-angle-spinning <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS <sup>13</sup>C NMR) spectroscopy was used to characterise semi-quantitatively the organic materials contained in particle size and density fractions isolated from five different mineral soils: two Mollisols, two Oxisols and an Andosol. The acquired spectra were analysed to determine the relative proportion of carboxyl, aromatic, O-alkyl and alkyl carbon contained in each fraction. Although similar types of carbon were present in all of the fractions analysed, an influence of both soil type and particle size was evident. The chemical structure of the organic materials contained in the particle size fractions isolated from the Andosol was similar; however, for the Mollisols and Oxisols, the content of O-alkyl, aromatic and alkyl carbon was greatest in the coarse, intermediate and fine fractions, respectively. The compositional differences noted in progressing from the coarser to finer particle size fractions in the Mollisols and Oxisols were consistent with the changes noted in other studies where CP/MAS <sup>13</sup>C NMR was used to monitor the decomposition of natural organic materials. Changes in the C:N ratio of the particle size fractions supported the proposal that the extent of decomposition of the organic materials contained in the fine fractions was greater than that contained in the coarse fractions. The increased content of aromatic and alkyl carbon in the intermediate size fractions could be explained completely by a selective preservation mechanism; however, the further accumulation of alkyl carbon in the clay fractions appeared to result from both a selective preservation and an in situ synthesis. The largest compositional differences noted for the entire organic fraction of the five soils were observed between soil orders. The differences within orders were smaller. The Mollisols and the Andosol were both dominated by O-alkyl carbon but the Andosol had a lower alkyl carbon content. The Oxisols were dominated by both O-alkyl and alkyl carbon. A model describing the oxidative decomposition of plant materials in mineral soils is proposed and used to explain the influence of soil order and particle size on the chemical composition of soil organic matter in terms of its extent of decomposition and bioavailability.
1469588|Release of oxygen from the roots of aquatic macrophytes into anaerobic sediments can affect the quantity of interstitial dissolved organic matter and nutrients that are available to bacteria. Nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were compared between subsurface (interstitial) waters of unvegetated sediments and sediments among stands of the emergent herbaceous macrophyte Juncus effusus L. in a lotic wetland ecosystem. Concentrations of inorganic nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) were greater from sediments of the unvegetated compared to the vegetated zone. DOC concentrations of interstitial waters were greater in sediments of the unvegetated zone both in the winter and spring compared to those from the vegetated zone. Although DOC concentrations in hydrosoils collected from both zones increased from winter to spring, bacterial productivity per mg DOC in spring decreased compared to winter. Greater initial bacterial productivity occurred on DOM collected from the vegetated compared to the unvegetated zone in winter samples (days 1 and 4), with increased bacterial productivity on samples collected from the unvegetated zone at the end of the study (day 20). Bacterial productivity was significantly greater on all sampling days on DOM from vegetated samples compared to unvegetated samples. In nutrient enrichment experiments, bacterial productivity was significantly increased (p < 0.05) with phosphorus but not nitrogen only amendments.
23359746|Humic substances (HS) constitute 5080% of total dissolved organic matter (DOM) in freshwaters but in the open ocean <3%, indicating that large fractions of DOM and HS are removed in the estuarine and coastal zone. In order to assess the role of bacteria in this removal, we conducted experiments in flow-through cultures to examine the decomposition of peat bog-born humic acids (HA) by marine (salinity 30, Exp1) and estuarine (salinity 10, Exp2) bacterial communities. After  70 days 40->60% of the HA were decomposed. Highest fractions were decomposed in treatments in which the bacterial communities were fed by HA media of a foreign salinity, e.g., of 14 in Exp1 and of 28 in Exp2. Some of the HA material was not decomposed but broken down to smaller moieties entering the fulvic acid (FA) fraction. The analysis of the HA media and their residuals after bacterial decomposition by pyrolysis GC/MS showed that individual organic compounds were decomposed. In Exp1, 32 aliphatic and aromatic compounds, including lignin biomarkers, were detected in the HA medium of which mainly aliphatic compounds were decomposed. In Exp2, 49 compounds were detected of which  40-60% were not detected any more after bacterial decomposition in the HA fraction but still in the FA fraction. The results show that estuarine and marine bacterial communities can decompose large amounts of HA and that this process is important in reducing the amount of terrestrial HS and DOM entering the estuarine and coastal region.
1469074|Models of P transformations during pedogenesis and with succession have developed from studies in temperate humid regions with neutral to acidic soils. Little is known about P biogeochemistry and P availability in semi-arid Mediterranean-type shrublands with alkaline soils. We studied P transformations in a series of semi-arid, dolomitic shrublands in southeastern Spain, ranging from a frequently-burned, open gorse-scrubland on eroded Typic Xerorthents to a long-unburned, mature garrigue on Entic Haploxerolls. In contrast to the common pattern of decreasing total P concentrations in the soil profile with soil development due to leaching, total P increased markedly in this system. This is due to concentration increases of relatively insoluble elements (P, Al, Fe, Ti) as karstification of parent material (dolomitic marbles with up to 94% Ca-Mg carbonate) during pedogenesis released bicarbonate and, subsequently, Ca and Mg leached from the profile at a higher rate. The total element to Ti ratios indicated that the relative ion weathering loss sequence, from easily weathered to resistant ions, was Ca>Mg>>>P>Fe>=Al>Ti, showing that P is lost from these shrublands at an intermediate rate. In one extreme of the series (the open gorse-scrubland), most soil P was Ca bound and organic P concentrations, organic matter content and phosphatase activity were very low, as predicted by the model of Walker and Syers for the initial stages of soil development. However, this site showed the highest inorganic soil solution P concentration, low soil P fixation capacity and the lowest foliar N:P ratios. Soils from the intermediate stages of the series showed the highest labile inorganic and labile organic P concentrations. At the other extreme of the series (the mature garrigue), a high proportion of soil P was in occluded inorganic and organic forms as predicted by the Walker and Syers' model. However, Ca bound P still accounted for the largest single P fraction. Soils showed very high sorption capacity (and high extractable Fe and Al concentrations) and released very little P to solution. Increasing values for NaOH extractable Po, organic matter and phosphatase activity indicate that cycling of P through organic matter is increasingly important with ecosystem development through the series.
25652600|Sodium polytungstate (SPT) is currently the material of choice for soil density fractionation (DF). We recently detected high levels of N in several types of commercially available SPT (0.741.4 mg g), raising a concern that undesirable chemical effects on soils may occur during the DF procedure. To address this concern, we conducted two experiments to examine effects of SPT on C and N in the resulting soil fractions. First we suspended A-horizon material from three soil types of greatly differing mineralogy for 24 h in solutions containing three types of commercially obtained SPT and commercial SPT that had been passed through cation exchange resin columns. We compared %C, %N, N and C values in treated and untreated soils. We also spiked SPT with tracer-level NH to measure potential NH absorption by the soil fractions. Results suggest that the N-rich commercially available SPT can have a considerable effect on N values, likely due to the presence of N-enriched NH in the SPT. In one of our soils, N enrichment of 3 was observed associated with overnight soaking in N-rich SPT (0.74 mg g). By contrast, when using SPT with low levels of N (0.05 mg g), no significant changes in N were observed. The remaining soil (after suspension and rinsing) was similar in %C, %N, N and C to the untreated bulk soil, suggesting that suspension of soil in SPT with low N levels purchased from the manufacturer or else through treatment with cation exchange resins does not greatly alter these variables. Low-N SPT is available commercially although it must be specifically requested from the manufacturer and is currently more expensive to purchase. Our results confirm that SPT tested and known to be low in C and N (<0.06 mg g) does not adversely contaminate soils during the soil density fractionation procedure. If using newly purchased or recycled SPT with higher N or C levels than this, we recommend thorough testing for possible contamination effects prior to use. However we caution against using SPT that contains N or C levels >0.5 mg g.
1469318| Twelve softwater lakes in NE Minnesota were sampled in spring, summer, and fall of 1992 and 1993 for labile (unextracted) methyl-Hg, total (extracted) methyl-Hg, and total Hg in lake water and net plankton (300 m). The lakes are small (5.6-56 ha), low productivity, headwater drainage or seepage lakes. They are acid-sensitive (ANC 200 eq/L) but not low pH lakes (average pH 6.6). The lakes ranged in color from 8.5 to 70 PCU. Statistical analysis of the water chemistry variables and mercury species support the conclusion that these were a homogeneous set of lakes; therefore, seasonality of mercury forms was analyzed on combined (mean) data from the 12 lakes. Methyl-Hg in water declined throughout the growing season. Hg<sub>T</sub> also declined sharply from spring to summer but increased again in the fall. In contrast to the methyl-Hg and Hg in water, concentrations in plankton were at the lowest levels in spring and rose to higher levels in summer. The mass of mercury in plankton increased from spring to fall, as did the methyl-Hg fraction, which increased from 20% of Hg<sub>T</sub> in spring to 52% in autumn. Bioaccumulation factors (BAF) for methyl-Hg in net plankton increased over the growing season. Overall, log BAF for Hg<sub>T</sub> in net plankton (wet wt.) was 4.45. Log BAF for methyl-Hg in plankton was 4.90 to 5.43 depending or the analytical form of methyl-Hg in water (labile or total). Seasonal patterns of methyl-Hg and Hg<sub>T</sub> did not covary in water, but did covary in plankton. These results support the conclusion that measurement of Hg in water is not adequate in itself to determine the amount of bioavailable Hg (i.e., methyl-Hg) in a lake. Labile (unextracted) methyl-Hg could be a useful measurement of bioavailable Hg. Labile methyl-Hg exhibits the same seasonal patterns as total methyl-Hg, but does not require the extraction steps necessary for measuring total methyl-Hg. 
24715154|Environmental perturbations such as changes in land use, climate, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations may alter organic matter inputs to surface soils. While the carbon (C) cycle response to such perturbations has received considerable attention, potential responses of the soil nitrogen (N) cycle to changing organic matter inputs have been less well characterized. Changing litter inputs to surface to soils may alter the soil N cycle directly, by controlling N substrate availability, or indirectly, via interactions with soil C biogeochemistry. We investigated soil N-cycling responses to a leaf litter manipulation in a lowland tropical forest using isotopic and molecular techniques. Both removing and doubling leaf litter inputs decreased the size of the soil nitrate pool, gross nitrification rates, and the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. Gross nitrification rates were correlated with the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea, and shifts in the N-cycling microbial community composition correlated with concurrent changes in edaphic properties, notably pH and C:N ratios. These results highlight the importance of understanding coupled biogeochemical cycles in global change scenarios and suggest that environmental perturbations that alter organic matter inputs in tropical forests could reduce inorganic N losses to surface waters and the atmosphere by limiting nitrate production.
40343524|The effects of organic enrichment on sediment biogeochemistry was studied in diffusion controlled sediment mesocosms, where labile organic matter (OM) (fish feed) pulses were added once a week to the sediment surface. Two types of sediments, differing mainly in content of reactive Fe, were used. The aim of this experiment was two-fold, (1) to evaluate the importance of Fe-driven sulfide buffering for sulfide accumulation in surface enriched sediments, and (2) to estimate the diagenetic capacity for degradation of labile OM near the sediment surface. The simulated OM loading rate of 375 mmol C m day led to a 5-6 times increase in CO-production and a 4-5 times increase in O-uptake. Sulfate reduction estimated by radiotracer experiments and CO-release was 105-131 mmol m day, but accumulation of porewater sulfide was low in both sediment types. Instead 99% of sulfide was oxidized with O at the sediment water interface in the low Fe treatment, whereas 46% of produced sulfide precipitated as Fe-S compound in the high Fe treatment resulting in significantly lower O-uptake. Furthermore, the accumulation of up to 30% of added OM by the end of the experiment indicated a saturation of the heterotrophic microbial communities in the upper enriched surface layer. These results suggest a maximum diagenetic capacity for OM degradation in the range of ~25 mol C cm day or 260 mmol m day for the present sediment types.
20519783|We tested the hypothesis that reservoirs with low water residence time and autochthonous production influence river biogeochemistry in eutrophied river systems draining cultivated watersheds. The effect of a single artificial water reservoir and consecutive reservoirs on silica (Si) river fluxes is exemplified by the moderately dammed Vistula River and the heavily regulated Daugava River that are compared with the practically undammed Oder River. The sum of the discharge weighted annual mean biogenic silica (BSi) and dissolved silicate (DSi) concentrations in the rivers Oder, Vistula and Daugava were about 160 M (40 + 120 M), 150 M (20 + 130 M) and 88 M (6 + 82 M), respectively. Assuming BSi and DSi concentrations as observed in the Oder River as typical for eutrophied but undammed rivers, complete trapping of this BSi could have lowered Si fluxes to the Baltic Sea from rivers with cultivated watersheds by 25%. The superimposed effect of hydrological alterations on reduced Si land-sea fluxes is demonstrated by studies in the boreal/subarctic and oligotrophic rivers Kalixlven and Luelven. The DSi yield of the heavily dammed Lulelven (793 kg km yr) constituted only 63% of that was found in the unregulated Kalixlven (1261 kg km yr), despite the specific runoff of the Lulelven (672 mm m yr) being 19% higher than that of theKalixlven (563 mm m yr); runoff normalized DSi yield of the former, regulated watershed, was only half the DSi yield of the latter, unperturbed watershed. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized here that perturbed surface water-groundwater interactions are the major reasons for the reduced annual fluctuations in DSi concentrations as also seen in the heavily dammed and eutrophic river systems such as the Daugava and Danube.
40647954|A series of laboratory-based and field experiments was conducted to address the effects of sunlight-exposed resuspended sediments on dissolved nutrient fluxes in two different water bodies. In suspensions of tidal creek sediments in 0.2 m-filtered creek water, measurable increases in dissolved nutrients occurred after only 2 h of exposure to simulated sunlight. During a 6-h irradiation, nutrient release rates for total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and phosphate were 2.2  0.5 (standard error; S.E.) mol g h and 0.09  0.005 mol g h (S.E.), compared to no significant changes in dark controls. The majority of nitrogen was released as dissolved organic nitrogen (87% on average) with lesser amounts of ammonium (13%). Continental shelf sediments resuspended in unfiltered seawater also released phosphate and TDN when exposed to sunlight, suggesting that this process can occur in a variety of marine and estuarine environments. The source material for inorganic nutrients appears to be associated with sediments rather than dissolved organic matter, as no significant changes in nutrient concentrations occurred in experiments with 0.2 m-filtered creek water or seawater alone. Results suggest that photoproduction of dissolved nutrients from resuspended sediments could be an episodically significant and previously unrecognized source of dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients to coastal ecosystems. This process may be especially important for continental margins where episodic resuspension events occur, as well as in regions experiencing high riverine sediment fluxes resulting from erosion associated with deforestation and desertification.
20456411|Organic and inorganic carbon (C) fluxes transported by water were evaluated for dominant hydrologic flowpaths on two adjacent headwater catchments in the Brazilian Amazon with distinct soils and hydrologic responses from September 2003 through April 2005. The Ultisoldominated catchment produced 30% greater volume of storm-related quickflow (overland flow and shallow subsurface flow) compared to the Oxisol-dominated catchment. Quickflow fluxes were equivalent to 3.2  0.2% of event precipitation for the Ultisol catchment, compared to 2.5  0.3% for the Oxisol-dominated watershed (mean response 1 SE, n = 27 storms for each watershed). Hydrologic responses were also faster on the Ultisol watershed, with time to peak flow occurring 10 min earlier on average as compared to the runoff response on the Oxisol watershed. These different hydrologic responses are attributed primarily to large differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity (
40343559|Dissolution of diatom biogenic silica (bSiO) in estuaries and its control by water salinity and bacteria were investigated using the river euryhaline species Cyclotella meneghiniana as a model. Laboratory-controlled bioassays conducted at different salinities with an estuarine bacteria inoculum showed a faster dissolution of diatom bSiO at the lowest salinity where bacteria were the most abundant. However in another experiment, salinity increase clearly enhanced the dissolution of cleaned frustules (organic matter free). The presence of active bacteria might therefore predominate on the effect of salinity for freshly lysed diatoms whereas salinity might rather control dissolution of organic-matterfree frustule remains. Incubation of cultivated diatoms at different protease concentrations revealed that high proteolytic activities had little effect on bSiO dissolution at a 1-month scale in spite of an efficient removal of organic matter from the frustules. Altogether it is hypothesized that bacterial colonization increases bSiO dissolution by creating a microenvironment at the diatom surface with high ectoproteolytic activity but also via the release of metabolic byproducts since the presence of organic matter seems generally to facilitate diatom bSiO dissolution.
40647937|Over the past 20+ years, fish with elevated concentrations of mercury (Hg) have been observed in remote lake districts, including the Adirondack region of New York. Across eastern North America studies have also reported a negative correlation between fish Hg concentration and lake pH. Recent controls in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO) have resulted in some improvement in the acidbase status of acid-impacted surface waters including Adirondack lakes. In addition, there has been an apparent decrease in atmospheric Hg deposition. A synoptic survey of 25 lakes in the Adirondacks was conducted in 1992-1993 to analyze spatial patterns of Hg in the water column and yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The same cluster of 25 lakes was resurveyed in 2005-2006 to evaluate if changes in lake concentrations of Hg species or fish Hg have occurred. We observed a varied response of changes in water chemistry and fish Hg concentrations. In twelve of the resurveyed lakes the yellow perch had lower Hg concentrations, six lakes had yellow perch with higher Hg concentrations, and in seven lakes yellow perch Hg concentrations did not change significantly ( = 0.05). Four variables appear to influence the change in yellow perch Hg concentrations in the Adirondacks: watershed area, elevation, change in pH, and change in fish body condition. We hypothesize that as the acidity in lakes is attenuated, the lakes may become more productive and/or water quality conditions less stressful to fish leading to increasing fish body condition. As fish body condition improves, fish exhibit "growth dilution" of tissue contaminants leading to lower fish Hg concentrations.
1469736| The objective of this study was to discern the source of higher than usual concentrations of chloride in drainage water collected from experimental forest plots after clear-cutting. When the sandbox experiments were initiated at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest Station three vegetation types were established: red pine, grass, and minimally vegetated (scattered lichens and bryophytes) as the "bare" control plot. After 15 years of growth the trees were cut down and above-ground biomass removed from the red pine sandbox. For several years prior to the cut, high concentrations ( 75 M) of dissolved Cl<sup>-</sup> in drainage waters occurred in November/December. This is attributed to the buildup of rainfall-derived Cl<sup>-</sup> due to evapotranspiration that depletes soil moisture to low levels resulting in a lack of drainage during this period. The excess Cl<sup>-</sup> is quickly flushed out by subsequent drainage over a few weeks and Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations return to values characteristic of rainfall and throughfall. After the trees were removed in May, 1998, Cl<sup>-</sup> continued to be leached from the system. The concentration of Cl<sup>-</sup> peaked (175 M) in Sept. 1998 and did not return back to base level concentration until Dec. 1999. The Cl<sup>-</sup> release pattern is distinctly different from that of dissolved NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, which peaked about one year later than Cl<sup>-</sup>. An excess (over that of the control sandbox) of 78 g Cl<sup>-</sup> was released in the 1.5 year period after clear-cut, showing that a large amount of leachable chloride is stored in the bulk soil/root/organic matter fraction. Lack of uptake by trees may be part of the reason for this chloride pulse. But an analysis of chloride content in roots and litter indicates that as much as 50% of the chloride leached from the sandbox may have come from the decaying roots and litter. Additional chloride may have been released from the soil organic matter by decomposition. The biochemical behavior of Cl<sup>-</sup> in systems such as this should be evaluated before assuming Cl<sup>-</sup> to be conservative for purposes of hydrological transport or soil weathering studies. 
20055318|We evaluated spatial patterns of soil N and C mineralization, microbial community composition (phospholipid fatty acids), and local site characteristics (plant/forest floor cover, soil pH, soil %C and %N) in a 0.25-ha burned black spruce forest stand in interior Alaska. Results indicated that factors governing soil N and C mineralization varied at two different scales. In situ net N mineralization was autocorrelated with microbial community composition at relatively broad scales (8 m) and with local site characteristics ('site' axis 1 of non-metric scaling ordination) at relatively fine scales (2-4 m). At the scale of the individual core, soil moisture was the best predictor of in situ net N mineralization and laboratory C mineralization, explaining between 47 and 67% of the variation (p &lt 0.001). Ordination of microbial lipid data showed that bacteria were more common in severely burned microsites, whereas fungi were more common in low fire severity microsites. We conclude that C and N mineralization rates in this burned black spruce stand were related to different variables depending on the scale of analysis, suggesting the importance of considering multiple scales of variability among key drivers of C and N transformations.
40800602|Stream DOC dynamics during snowmelt have been the focus of much research, and numerous DOC mobilization and delivery mechanisms from riparian and upland areas have been proposed. However, landscape structure controls on DOC export from riparian and upland landscape elements remains poorly understood. We investigated stream and groundwater DOC dynamics across three transects and seven adjacent but diverse catchments with a range of landscape characteristics during snowmelt (April 15July 15) in the northern Rocky Mountains, Montana. We observed a range of DOC export dynamics across riparian and upland landscape settings and varying degrees of hydrologie connectivity between the stream, riparian, and upland zones. DOC export from riparian zones required a hydrologic connection across the riparian-stream interface, and occurred at landscape positions with a wide range of upslope accumulated area (UAA) and wetness status. In contrast, mobilization of DOC from the uplands appeared restricted to areas with a hydrologie connection across the entire upland-riparian-stream continuum, which generally occurred only at areas with high UAA, and/or at times of high wetness. Further, the relative extent of DOC-rich riparian and wetland zones strongly influenced catchment DOC export. Cumulative stream DOC export was highest from catchments with a large proportion of riparian to upland area, and ranged from 6.3 to 12.4 kg ha across the study period. This research suggests that the spatial/temporal intersection of hydrologie connectivity and DOC source areas drives stream DOC export.
40343577|The dynamic hydro-geochemical Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) was used to predict the response of 163 Finnish lake catchments to historic and future atmospheric deposition (1880-2100) and future tree harvesting practices. Deposition was assumed to follow current legislated European emission reduction policies (CLe) and a scenario based on maximum (technically) feasible reductions (MFR). Future harvesting was assumed to shift from stem-only harvesting (SOH) to whole-tree harvesting (WTH) owing to the potential increased utilisation of biofuels. Despite the modest changes in atmospheric deposition under CLe (compared to current day), these reductions are predicted to halt the decline in soil base saturation; however, further reductions are required to improve soil and lake water chemistry. The MFR scenario predicted a significant long-term improvement in soil base saturation leading to continued long-term recovery in surface waters (all lakes with ANC > 0 by 2100). However under the WTH scenario, significant long-term impacts (re-acidification) were predicted for soil and surface water chemistry (14 lakes with ANC < 0 by 2100). To some extent the long-term negative impacts were reduced under MFR, indicating that increased utilisation of biofuels will necessitate 'trading emissions for timber', or soil amendment, to maintain ecosystem quality and sustainable forest growth. The current practice of SOH is close to the sustainable maximum harvesting under current (legislated) atmospheric deposition in Finland.
20456548|Soil is a prominent component of terrestrial C and N budgets. Soil C and N pools are influenced by, and may reciprocally influence, many environmental factors. Our objective was to determine the quantitative relations of surface mineral-soil organic C, N, and C/N ratios to climate and soil texture across seven ecological regions that make up the conterminous USA. Up to 608 soil profiles per region and their corresponding climates were evaluated with regression analysis. The organic C pool (kg C m) in the upper 20 cm of mineral soil was positively related to mean annual precipitation, evapo-transpiration and clay content in all regions. It was negatively related to a temperature/precipitation index in all regions and negatively related to mean annual temperature, except in the northwest temperate forest region. Soil C/N ratios were negatively related to clay or silt content in all regions. These relations are consistent with concepts of moisture and temperature controls on detrital production, differential effects of temperature on detrital production and decomposition, and stabilization of organic matter by clay and silt. Differences in quantitative relations among regions may be related to vegetation-composition effects on soil organic matter processes, clay mineralogy, and faunal mixing of surface organic horizons with mineral soil. Regional differences also occurred in the importance of climate vs. soil texture in explaining the variability in soil C. The regional differences indicate the importance of using region-specific, rather than generalized, equations for projecting long-term soil responses to climate change and for conducting ecosystem-model calibration or validation.
1469238| Nitrogen fixation by periphyton and plankton was measured on the Amazon floodplain using the acetylene reduction method calibrated with <sup>15</sup>N-N<sub>2</sub>. The average ratio ( SD) of moles C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> reduced per mole N<sub>2</sub>-N fixed was 3.4  0.7, similar to other studies. Periphyton and plankton had high rates of light-dependent nitrogen fixation, with dark nitrogen fixation averaging 26% of the average rates in the light. The average daily (24 h) rates for periphyton nitrogen fixation in 1989 and 1990 were 1.79 and 0.51 mmol N<sub>2</sub>-N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> respectively, which are comparable to summer rates in many temperate cyanobacterial assemblages. Nitrogen fixation was depressed at NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations as low as 0.5 M, and was below detection limits at concentrations of 4 M, which occurred during periods of river flooding. Planktonic nitrogen fixation rates were high (0.5-0.8 mmol N<sub>2</sub>-N m<sup>2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) during the high-water and drainage phases of the annual hydrograph when the floodplain waters were draining towards the river (low NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), but rates were undetectable <latex>$(<0.05\ \text{mmol N}_{2}-\text{N}\cdot \text{m}^{2}\cdot \text{d}^{-1})$</latex> when there was river flooding (high NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Nitrogen fixation by periphyton and plankton in 1989-1990 accounted for approximately 8% of previously reported total annual nitrogen inputs to the floodplain at Lake Calado. 
20519872|The chemical composition and vertical distribution of sediment phosphorus (P) in shallow coastal sediments of the northeastern Baltic Sea (BS) were characterized by sequential extraction. Different P forms were related to chemical and physical properties of the sediments and the chemistry of pore water and near-bottom water. Sediment P composition varied among the sampling sites located in the Archipelago Sea (AS) and along the northern coast of the Gulf of Finland (GoF): the organic rich sites were high in organic P (OP), while apatite-P dominated in the area affected by sediment transportation. Although the near-bottom water was oxic, the sediments released P. Release of P was most pronounced at the site with high sediment OP and reduced conditions in the sediment-water interface, indicating that P had its origins in organic sources as well as in reducible iron (Fe) oxyhydroxides. The results suggest that even though these coastal areas are shallow enough to lack salinity stratification typical for the brackish BS, they are vulnerable to seasonal oxygen (O) depletion and P release because of their patchy bottom topography, which restricts mixing of water. Furthermore, coastal basins accumulate organic matter (OM) and OP, degradation of which further diminishes O and creates the potential for P release from the sediment. In these conditions, an abundance of labile OP may cause marked efflux of P from sediment reserves in the long-term.
20519851|Compared to upland forests, riparian forest soils have greater potential to remove nitrate (NO) from agricultural runoff through denitrification. It is unclear, however, whether prolonged exposure of riparian soils to nitrogen (N) loading will affect the rate of denitrification and its end products. This research assesses the rate of denitrification and nitrous oxide (NO) emissions from riparian forest soils exposed to prolonged nutrient runoff from plant nurseries and compares these to similar forest soils not exposed to nutrient runoff. Nursery runoff also contains high levels of phosphate (PO). Since there are conflicting reports on the impact of PO on the activity of denitrifying microbes, the impact of PO on such activity was also investigated. Bulk and intact soil cores were collected from N-exposed and non-exposed forests to determine denitrification and NO emission rates, whereas denitrification potential was determined using soil slurries. Compared to the non-amended treatment, denitrification rate increased 2.7- and 3.4-fold when soil cores collected from both N-exposed and non-exposed sites were amended with 30 and 60 g NO-N g soil, respectively. Net NO emissions were 1.5 and 1.7 times higher from the N-exposed sites compared to the non-exposed sites at 30 and 60 g NO-N g soil amendment rates, respectively. Similarly, denitrification potential increased 17 times in response to addition of 15 g NO-N g in soil slurries. The addition of PO (5 g PO-P g) to soil slurries and intact cores did not affect denitrification rates. These observations suggest that prolonged N loading did not affect the denitrification potential of the riparian forest soils; however, it did result in higher NO emissions compared to emission rates from non-exposed forest soils.
1469152|The chemical composition of surface waters of two Dutch moorland pools and of incident precipitation, was monitored from 1982 to 1990. For this period, sulfur and water budgets were calculated using a hydrochemical model developed for well-mixed nonstratifying lakes. Total atmospheric deposition of S decreased significantly after 1986 at both locations. A model describing the sulfur budget in terms of input output and reduction/oxidation processes predicted a fast decrease of pool water SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations after a decrease of atmospheric input. However, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in the surface water was lowered only slightly or remained constant. Apparently a source within the lake caused the unexpectedly high SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations. The possible supply of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> from the sediment through regulation by (K-)Al-SO<sub>4</sub> containing minerals or desorption of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> from positively charged surfaces in the sediment was evaluated. Solubility calculations of pore water with respect to alunite, basaluminite and jurbanite indicated that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration was not regulated by these minerals. It is suggested here (1) that desorption of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> from peaty sediments may account for the estimated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> supply provided that the adsorption complex is periodically recharged by partial oxidation of the upper bottom sediments and (2) that because of exposure of a part of the pool bottom to the atmosphere during dry summers and subsequent oxidation of reduced S, the amount of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> may be provided which complements the decreasing depositional SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> input. In future research these two mechanisms need to be investigated.
20519819|Nitrogen releases to air and water are low in most of Canada, but in southern areas with rapid development there are telltale signs of the problems from releases to air and water that are described elsewhere in this volume. These include higher nitrogen in water and releases to the atmosphere from urban areas, industry and agriculture. As a result, in parts of Ontario and Quebec underlain by Precambrian geology, nitrogen deposition is near the critical loads found for geologically similar areas of Europe. In particular, combined inputs of sulphuric and nitric acids are causing base cation depletion in forest soils and keeping some lakes at pH values too low to allow the recovery of biological communities. In southern Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, rapidly expanding human populations, industry and agriculture are causing high concentrations of nitrate in surface and groundwaters. At present, there is little sign of estuarine eutrophication in Canada, but it appears to be imminent on the Pacific coast, as the result of expanding human populations and intensifying agriculture in the lower Fraser Valley and Puget Sound. Steps should be taken now to prevent the widespread problems caused by nitrogen pollution that have occurred in Europe, the USA, and other populous and industrialized regions.
1468972|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Lake Fryxell, 10 streams flowing into the lake, and the moat surrounding the lake was studied to determine the influence of sources and biogeochemical processes on its distribution and chemical nature. Lake Fryxell is an amictic, permanently ice-covered lake in the McMurdo Dry Valleys which contains benthic and planktonic microbial populations, but receives essentially no input of organic material from the ahumic soils of the watershed. Biological activity in the water column does not appear to influence the DOC depth profile, which is similar to the profiles for conservative inorganic constituents. DOC values for the streams varied with biomass in the stream channel, and ranged from 0.2 to 9.7 mg C/L. Fulvic acids in the streams were a lower percentage of the total DOC than in the lake. These samples contain recent carbon and appear to be simpler mixtures of compounds than the lake samples, indicating that they have undergone less humification. The fulvic acids from just above the sediments of the lake have a high sulfur content and are highly aliphatic. The main transformations occurring as these fractions diffuse upward in the water column are 1) loss of sulfur groups through the oxycline and 2) decrease in aliphatic carbon and increase in the heterogeneity of aliphatic moieties. The fraction of modern <sup>14</sup>C content of the lake fulvic acids range from a minimum of 0.68 (approximately 3000 years old) at 15m depth to 0.997 (recent material) just under the ice. The major processes controlling the DOC in the lake appear to be: 1) The transport of organic matter by the inflow streams resulting in the addition of recent organic material to the moat and upper waters of the lake; 2) The diffusion of organic matter composed of relict organic material and organic carbon resulting from the degradation of algae and bacteria from the bottom waters or sediments of the lake into overlying glacial melt water; 3) The addition of recent organic matter to the bottom waters of the lake from the moat.
1469572| A new laboratory method is introduced to study the formation of phosphate binding iron(III) oxides at the redox boundary in marine sediments. A sediment core is given a very well-defined oxic-anoxic interface by placing a 0.45 m filter between the sediment and the overlying water. After a period of 1 months the filter is covered with a layer of fresh iron oxides, formed by the oxidation of upward diffusing Fe<sup>2+</sup> from the sediment pore water. The formed iron oxides are investigated by electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EXPMA). With a sediment core from the brackish Baltic Sea the average molar composition of 788 formed particles is Fe<sub>1.00 0.13</sub>P<sub>0.55 0.06</sub>Ca<sub>0.37 0.04</sub> plus unknown amounts of O, H and C. The results show that the particles have a uniform composition, and that calcium plays an important role in the phosphate binding. The laboratory method is a useful supplement to in situ sampling for studies of iron oxides. 
1469316|The input and output flux data of total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) from three catchments located in different geographical regions in Sweden and one catchment in southern Finland were compared to elucidate the role of current atmospheric Hg/MeHg deposition with regard to waterborne Hg/MeHg output. There was a negative co-variaton between the open field THg inputs and the ratio of THg output to open field input. The highest ratio (and lowest input) occurring in N. Sweden and S. Finland, while the lowest output ratio (and highest inputs) occurred in southwest Sweden. A much larger variation was found in the ratio of output to open field input for MeHg (14 to 160%). Examinations of MeHg input/output data in relation to catchment charateristics suggest that riparian peat, mires and wet organic soil contributed to the large MeHg output from certain catchments, probably due to in situ production of MeHg. This finding is consistent with other studies which have found that catchment characteristics such as wetland area flow pathways, seasonal temperature and water flow are important in controlling the output of MeHg. These catchment characteristics govern the fate of the contemporary input of Hg and MeHg as well as the mobilization of the soil pools.
20055187|We present a new soil respiration model, describe a formal model testing procedure, and compare our model with five alternative models using an extensive data set of observed soil respiration. Gas flux data from rangeland soils that included a large number of measurements at low temperatures were used to model soil CO emissions as a function of soil temperature and water content. Our arctangent temperature function predicts that
40647953|The South Atlantic Bight (SAB) has been a focus for the study of continental shelf ecosystem respiration during the past two decades. However, two questions concerning respiration in this area have yet to be answered. First, why do previous estimates of respiration in the SAB exceed measured carbon fixation rates by almost an order of magnitude? Second, considering that bacteria are responsible for most of the pelagic community respiration in the SAB, why is respiration almost uniform from the coastline to the shelf break, while bacterial production estimates decrease offshore? This study addresses these critical questions by presenting new pelagic community respiration data that were collected across the entire width of the continental shelf off Georgia, USA from June 2003 to May 2006. The respiration was calculated as in vitro changes of dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations during deck incubations. The measured respiration rates ranged from 0.3( 0.1) to 21.2( 1.4) mmol m day .They followed a clear seasonal pattern, being lowest over the entire shelf in winter and reaching maxima in summer. Summertime respiration rates were highest on the inner shelf and decreased with distance offshore. Consistent with this trend, bacterial abundance measurements taken during the sampling month of July 2005 followed a pattern of seaward decline. The SAB organic carbon fluxes calculated from the respiration data are close to the estimates for primary production, which resolves a long-standing mystery regarding perceived carbon imbalance in the SAB.
20456569|Atmospheric nutrient deposition has contributed to widespread changes in sensitive seminatural ecosystems throughout Europe. For an understanding of underlying processes it is important to quantify input-output flows in relation to ongoing atmospheric inputs and current management strategies. In this study we quantified losses of N, P, Ca, Mg, and K via leaching in heathland ecosystems (Lneburger Heide, NW Germany) as a function of current deposition rates and different management measures (mowing, prescribed burning, choppering, sod-cutting) which aim to prevent shrub and tree encroachment. Leaching was only moderately related to atmospheric input rates, indicating that leaching was mostly affected by internal turnover processes. Leaching significantly increased for most of the nutrients after the application of management measures, particularly in the choppered and sod-cut plots. However, atmospheric nutrient inputs exceeded leaching outputs for most of the nutrients, even in the plots subjected to management. Despite high deposition rates (20-25 kg N ha year), retention of atmospheric N input ranged between 74% and 92% in the control plots. In the treated plots, N retention decreased to 59-80%. However, in the study area mean N leaching in the controls has almost doubled since 1980 and currently amounts to 3.7 kg ha year, indicating an early stage of N saturation. Our study provides evidence that leaching did not compensate for atmospheric nutrient deposition, particularly as regards N. Management, thus, will be an indispensable tool for the maintenance of the low-nutrient status as a prerequisite for the long-term preservation of heathland ecosystems.
23359714|During the last decade the number of seawater dimethylsulfide (DMS) concentration measurements has increased substantially. The importance this gas, emitted from the ocean to the atmosphere, may have in the cloud microphysics and hence in the Earth albedo and radiation budget, makes it necessary to accurately reproduce the global distribution. Recently, the monthly global DMS climatology has been updated taking advantage of the threefold increased size and better resolved distribution of the observations available in the DMS database. Here, the emerging patterns found with the previous versions of the database and climatology are explored with the updated versions. The statistical relationships between the seasonalities of DMS concentrations and other variables are re-examined. The positive correlation previously found between surface seawater DMS and the daily-averaged climatological solar radiation dose in the upper mixed layer of the open ocean is confirmed with both the updated DMS database and climatology. Re-examination of the latitudinal match-mismatch between the seasonalities of DMS and phytoplankton, represented by the chlorophyll a concentration, reveals that they are highly positively correlated in latitudes higher than 40, but anti-correlated in the 2040 latitudinal bands of both hemispheres. Overall, these global emerging patterns provide key information to further understanding the factors that control the emission of volatile sulfur from the ocean. The large uncertainties associated with the methodologies used in global computations, however, call for caution in using these emerging patterns as predictive tools, and prompt to the design of time series and process-oriented studies aimed at testing the validity of the observed relationships.
24715111|Organic nitrogen use by mycorrhizal fungi and associated plants could fuel productivity in nitrogen-limited systems. To test whether fungi assimilated soil-derived organic nitrogen, we compared the C signal (expressed as C) from 1950s to 1960s thermonuclear testing in protein and structural carbon of ectomycorrhizal fungi. As expected, structural carbon had C similar to recent photosynthesis; however, protein C was either higher or lower than structural carbon depending on the fungal taxa. This suggests that some protein carbon derived from uptake of organic nitrogen with different C signals. Specimens from two taxa (Lactarius and Russula) adapted to taking up soluble nutrients had protein higher than structural carbon in C, indicating uptake of young, post-bomb organic nitrogen, whereas two taxa (Cortinarius and Leccinum) adapted to using insoluble, complex organic nutrients had protein lower than structural carbon in C, indicating uptake of old, pre-bomb organic nitrogen. Tuber, a genus common in mineral soil, was also consistently lower in C for protein than for structural carbon, with an estimated 10 % of protein carbon originating from old, deep organic nitrogen for this taxon. Our results indicate that radiocarbon can provide evidence of organic nitrogen use in ectomycorrhizal fungi and reflects the exploration depth of different taxa.
40343579|We studied the spatial and temporal variation in O and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) forms concentrations in ten subtropical watersheds located in the state of So Paulo, Brazil, with different degrees of impact by urbanization and land-use changes. Additionally, we used stable carbon isotopic composition of DIC to explain observed patterns. We found that landcover changes and watershed geology are the main drivers of DIC distribution. Land-cover/use changes influence the riverine DIC in two ways: by replacing the original Cerrado 3 (C3)-type forest vegetation by C4-type vegetation composed of grasses (pasture), and by sugarcane. Most domestic sewage is dumped untreated into rivers in the state of Sao Paulo. Consequently, in the most densely populated watersheds, sewage is an important source of labile carbon and consequently of DIC to rivers. In terms of geology, although silicate weathering that produces kaolinite is the main type of weathering in the watersheds, the weathering of carbonate cements present in the geological formations of the western portion of the state of Sao Paulo are also an important source of DIC to rivers.
1469689|A regression model (RivR-N) was developed that predicts the proportion of N removed from streams and reservoirs as an inverse function of the water displacement time of the water body (ratio of water body depth to water time of travel). When applied to 16 drainage networks in the eastern U.S., the RivR-N model predicted that 37% to 76% of N input to these rivers is removed during transport through the river networks. Approximately half of that is removed in 1st through 4th order streams which account for 90% of the total stream length. The other half is removed in 5th order and higher rivers which account for only about 10% of the total stream length. Most N removed in these higher orders is predicted to originate from watershed loading to small and intermediate sized streams. The proportion of N removed from all streams in the watersheds (37-76%) is considerably higher than the proportion of N input to an individual reach that is removed in that reach (generally <20%) because of the cumulative effect of continued nitrogen removal along the entire flow path in downstream reaches. This generally has not been recognized in previous studies, but is critical to an evaluation of the total amount of N removed within a river network. At the river network scale, reservoirs were predicted to have a minimal effect on N removal. A fairly modest decrease (<10 percentage points) in the N removed at the river network scale was predicted when a third of the direct watershed loading was to the two highest orders compared to a uniform loading.
23359719|Ambient aerosols collected from the marine atmospheric boundary layer of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea have been studied to assess the fractional solubility of aerosol iron, defined as Fe ws (%) = Fe ws /Fe Tot  100; where Fe Tot is total aerosol iron and Fe ws is water soluble iron. The mass concentration of Fe Tot over the two oceanic regions is not significantly different. However, the fractional solubility is 12 orders of magnitude higher over the Bay of Bengal (1.424%) compared to that over the Arabian Sea (0.020.4%). The spatio-temporal variability in Fe ws (%) is attributed to differences in the nature of the mineral dust over the two oceanic regions. The Arabian Sea receives coarse dust from desert regions; whereas transport of alluvial dust from the Indo-Gangetic Plain is a dominant source to the Bay of Bengal. The poor fractional solubility (<1%) of Fe from mineral dust, hitherto overestimated in the literature, is documented for the Arabian Sea. A significant linear relationship (P-value < 0.001) between Fe ws (%), Fe Tot and nss-SO 4 2- over the Bay of Bengal provides evidence for the chemical processing of mineral dust. Furthermore, the role of anthropogenic sources (biomass burning and fossil-fuel combustion) in enhancing the Fe ws (%) is discernible from the chemical composition of fine mode (PM 2.5 ) aerosols over the Bay of Bengal. The potential impact of these Fe-dust depositions on phytoplankton carbon fixation and surface ocean biogeochemistry is discussed.
1469745|The concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved nitrate-N, Total-N (TN), dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved silicate-Si (DSi) and their ratios in the world's largest rivers are examined using a global data base that includes 37% of the earth's watershed area and half its population. These data were compared to water quality in 42 subbasins of the relatively well-monitored Mississippi River basin (MRB) and of 82 small watersheds of the United States. The average total nitrogen concentration varies over three orders of magnitude among both world river watersheds and the MRB, and is primarily dependent on variations in dissolved nitrate concentration, rather than particulate or dissolved organic matter or ammonium. There is also a direct relationship between the DIN:DIP ratio and nitrate concentration. When nitrate-N exceeds 100  g-at l<sup>-1</sup>, the DIN:DIP ratio is generally above the Redfield ratio (16:1), which implies phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton growth. Compared to nitrate, the among river variation in the DSi concentration is relatively small so that the DSi loading (mass/area/time) is largely controlled by runoff volume. The well-documented influence of human activities on dissolved inorganic nitrogen loading thus exceeds the influences arising from the great variability in soil types, climate and geography among these watersheds. The DSi:nitrate-N ratio is controlled primarily by nitrogen loading and is shown to be inversely correlated with an index of landscape development -- the "City Lights" nighttime imagery. Increased nitrogen loading is thus driving the world's largest rivers towards a higher DIN:DIP ratio and a lower DSi:DIN ratio. About 7.3 and 21% of the world's population lives in watersheds with a DSi:nitrate-N ratio near a 1:1 and 2:1 ratio, respectively. The empirical evidence is that this percentage will increase with further economic development. When the DSi:nitrate-N atomic ratio is near 1:1, aquatic food webs leading from diatoms (which require silicate) to fish may be compromised and the frequency or size of harmful or noxious algal blooms may increase. Used together, the DSi:nitrate-N ratio and nitrate-N concentration are useful and robust comparative indicators of eutrophication in large rivers. Finally, we estimate the riverine loading to the ocean for nitrate-N, TN, DIP, TP and DSi to be 16.2, 21, 2.6, 3.7 to 5.6, and 194 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.
1468498| Sulphate fluxes in bulk deposition, throughfall and soil solution were monitored during two years, and integrated within a model describing the cycling of S in a chalk grassland ecosystem. Throughfall fluxes were strongly determined by interceptive properties of the grassland canopy. Seasonal variation in Leaf Area Index resulted in dry deposition velocities for SO<sub>2</sub> varying between 0.1 cm.s<sup>-1</sup> (snow cover, almost no aerodynamic resistance) to 0.9-1.8 cm.s<sup>-1</sup> in periods with a fully developed canopy. On an annual basis net canopy exchange (assimilation of SO<sub>2</sub> minus foliar leaching) was estimated to be - 15% of net throughfall. Simulated soil solution concentrations, being the result of throughfall input, leaching, adsorption, biomass uptake and mineralization, closely fitted actual values (r > 0.92; p < 0.001). Actual and simulated leaching were 1.74  0.03 and 2.00 keq.ha<sup>-1</sup>.yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Sulphur budgets for the soil showed net accumulation from April to October and net losses from October to April. Annual budgets for the ecosystem showed atmospheric input (2.02 keq.ha<sup>-1</sup>.yr<sup>-2</sup>) and actual output (2.05 keq.ha<sup>-1</sup>.yr<sup>-1</sup>) to be almost balanced. Apart from increased soil solution concentrations, additional input of sulphate (3.55 keq.ha<sup>-1</sup>.yr<sup>-1</sup>) to experimental plots resulted in additional accumulation in the ecosystem of 0.62 keq.ha<sup>-1</sup>.yr<sup>-1</sup>. 
40343549|Studies on biogeochemical cycling of carbon in the Chilka Lake, Asia's largest brackish lagoon on the east coast of India, revealed, for the first time, strong seasonal and spatial variability associated with salinity distribution. The lake was studied twice during May 2005 (premonsoon) and August 2005 (monsoon). It exchanges waters with the sea (Bay of Bengal) and several rivers open into the lake. The lake showed contrasting levels of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) in different seasons; DIC was higher by ~22% and DOC was lower by ~36% in premonsoon than in monsoon due to seasonal variations in their supply from rivers and in situ production/mineralisation. The DIC/DOC ratios in the lake during monsoon were influenced by physical mixing of end member water masses and by intense respiration of organic carbon. A strong relationship between excess DIC and apparent oxygen utilisation showed significant control of biological processes over CO production in the lake. Surface partial pressure of CO (pCO), calculated using pH-DIC couple according to Cai and Wang (Limnol and Oceanogr 43: 657-668, 1998), exhibited discernable gradients during monsoon through northern (1,033-6,522 atm), central (391-2,573 atm) and southern (102-718 atm) lake. The distribution pattern of pCO in the lake seems to be governed by pCO levels in rivers and their discharge rates, which were several folds higher during monsoon than premonsoon. The net CO efflux, based on gas transfer velocity parameterisation of Borges et al. (Limnol and Oceanogr 49(5): 1630-1641, 2004), from entire lake during monsoon (141 mmolC m d equivalent to 2.64 GgC d at basin scale) was higher by 44 times than during premonsoon (9.8 mmolC m d  0.06 GgC d). 15% of CO efflux from lake in monsoon was contributed by its supply from rivers and the rest was contributed by in situ heterotrophic activity. Based on oxygen and total carbon mass balance, net ecosystem production (NEP) of lake (308 mmo1C m d -3.77 GgC d) was found to be almost in consistent with the total riverine organic carbon trapped in the lake (229 mmolC m d  2.80 GgC d) suggesting that the strong heterotrophy in the lake is mainly responsible for elevated fluxes of CO during monsoon. Further, the pelagic net community production represented 92% of NEP and benthic compartment plays only a minor role. This suggests that Chilka lake is an important region in biological transformation of organic carbon to inorganic carbon and its export to the atmosphere.
1469698| The human induced input of reactive N into the global biosphere has increased to approximately 150 Tg N each year and is expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The need to feed (125 Tg N) and to provide energy (25 Tg N) for the growing world population drives this trend. This increase in reactive N comes at, in some instances, significant costs to society through increased emissions of NO<sub>x</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and deposition of NO<sub>y</sub> and NH<sub>x</sub>. In the atmosphere, increases in tropospheric ozone and acid deposition (NO<sub>y</sub> and NH<sub>x</sub>) have led to acidification of aquatic and soil systems and to reductions in forest and crop system production. Changes in aquatic systems as a result of nitrate leaching have led to decreased drinking water quality, eutrophication, hypoxia and decreases in aquatic plant diversity, for example. On the other hand, increased deposition of biologically available N may have increased forest biomass production and may have contributed to increased storage of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in plant and soils. Most importantly, synthetic production of fertilizer N has contributed greatly to the remarkable increase in food production that has taken place during the past 50 years. The development of policy to control unwanted reactive N release is difficult because much of the reactive N release is related to food and energy production and reactive N species can be transported great distances in the atmosphere and in aquatic systems. There are many possibilities for limiting reactive N emissions from fuel combustion, and in fact, great strides have been made during the past decades. Reducing the introduction of new reactive N and in curtailing the movement of this N in food production is even more difficult. The particular problem comes from the fact that most of the N that is introduced into the global food production system is not converted into usable product, but rather reenters the biosphere as a surplus. Global policy on N in agriculture is difficult because many countries need to increase food production to raise nutritional levels or to keep up with population growth, which may require increased use of N fertilizers. Although N cycling occurs at regional and global scales, policies are implemented and enforced at the national or provincial/state levels. Multinational efforts to control N loss to the environment are surely needed, but these efforts will require commitments from individual countries and the policy-makers within those countries. 
1468548|Soil C and N dynamics were studied in a sequence of old fields of increasing age to determine how these biogeochemical cycles change during secondary succession. In addition, three different late-successional forests were studied to represent possible "steady state" conditions. Surface soil samples collected from the fields and forests were analyzed for total C, H<sub>2</sub>O-soluble C, total N, potential net N mineralization, potential net nitrification, and microbial biomass. Above- and belowground plant biomass was estimated within each of the old field sites. Temporal changes in soil organic C, total N and total plant biomass were best described by a gamma function [y=at<sup>b</sup> e<sup>ctd</sup>+f] whereas a simple exponential model [y=a(1-e<sup>-bt</sup>)+c] provided the best fit to changes in H<sub>2</sub>O-soluble C, C:N ratio, microbial C, and microbial N. Potential N mineralization and nitrification linearly increased with field age; however, rates were variable among the fields. Microbial biomass was highly correlated to soil C and N pools and well correlated to the standing crop of plant biomass. In turn, plant biomass was highly correlated to pools and rates of N cycling. Patterns of C and N cycling within the old field sites were different from those in a northern hardwood forest and a xeric oak forest; however, nutrient dynamics within an oak savanna were similar to those found in a 60-yr old field. Results suggest that patterns in C and N cycling within the old-field chronosequence were predictable and highly correlated to the accrual of plant and microbial biomass.
1469668|Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) are considered to play an important role in the stabilization of intertidal mudflats. In this study the role of EPS as a binding agent in intertidal sediments was investigated. For this purpose two EPS fractions (termed coll-SF and EDTA-SF) were isolated from intertidal sediment and characterized in terms of monosaccharide- and size distribution. In slurry addition experiments the sorption characteristics of these EPS-fractions as well as their effect on sediment properties were examined under varying Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentrations. Results showed more EDTA-SF adsorbed to the sediment compared to coll-SF. For both fractions more EPS adsorbed to the sediment when Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration increased. This effect was stronger for EDTA-SF. The differences in sorption between the two fractions could not be explained in terms of monosaccharide- and size distribution, which were largely similar. The addition of EPS in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not alter the rheology of the sediment slurries indicating that there was no effect of EPS on the sediment properties. This contradicts results of experiments with bacterial EPS as well as field observations in which the presence of EPS/biofilms leads to an increase in the erosion resistance of the sediment. Possible causes for this discrepancy in results are discussed.
41490422|We used stream chemistry and hydrogeomorphology data from 549 stream and 447 river sites to estimate NON removal in the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers. We used two  removal models to predict NON input and removal. NON input ranged from 0.01 to 338 kg km d in the Upper Mississippi River to < 0.01-54 kg km d in the Missouri River. Cumulative river network NON input was 98700-101676 Mg year in the Ohio River, 85961-89288 Mg year in the Upper Mississippi River, and 59463-61541 Mg year" 1 in the Missouri River. NON output was highest in the Upper Mississippi River (0.01-329 kg km d ), followed by the Ohio and Missouri Rivers (< 0.01-236 kg km d ) sub-basins. Cumulative river network NON output was 97499 Mg year for the Ohio River, 84361 Mg year for the Upper Mississippi River, and 59200 Mg year for the Missouri River. Proportional NON removal (PNR) based on the two models ranged from < 0.01 to 0.28. NON removal was inversely correlated with stream order, and ranged from < 0.01 to 8.57 kg km d in the Upper Mississippi River to < 0.001-l .43 kg km d in the Missouri River. Cumulative river network NON removal predicted by the two models was: Upper Mississippi River 4152 and 4152 Mg year, Ohio River 3743 and 378 Mg year, and Missouri River 2277 and 197 Mg year. PNR removal was negatively correlated with both stream order (r = -0.80-0.87) and the percent of the catchment in agriculture (r = -0.38-0.76).
41490530|Changes in mass and chemical composition of Pinus sylvestris senescent needles were studied over a 5 year period in Mediterranean (MF) and Continental forests (CF) in the Pyrenees under varying levels of thinning (P0: reference, no thinning; P20: removal of 20% basal area, P30: removal of 30% basal area). Decomposition rates were higher in MF (k = 0.423 year) than in CF (k = 0.245 year). However, the maximum decomposition limit was higher in CF (87.9%) compared to MF (78.1%). The relative importance and timing of rainfall, and cellulose and lignin abundance on the decomposition process was similar among both sites. However, air temperature and degree-days only affected CF (the colder site) during the initial stages of decomposition, while litter moisture was significant only in MF (the drier site) in the latter stages of decomposition. Nutrient and carbon dynamics showed temporal patterns similar to those reported in higher latitudes (except for Ca), however, indicators of N mineralization such as C/N and lignin/N at the study sites were lower than values reported in the literature. Decreases in decomposition rates after thinning were higher in MF than in CF, indicating that this ecosystem could, in the short term, be more sensitive to human intervention. Thinning had similar temporary qualitative effects at both sites, slowing decomposition, increasing N and P immobilization and decreasing Ca immobilization. However, quantitative effects of thinning were site dependent in that the magnitude of nutrient immobilization was higher in CF. A conceptual model is presented to explain effects of thinning on litter N dynamics. These temporary changes are not trivial as nutrient immobilization and accumulated organic matter losses over a thinning cycle may affect tree growth particularly during short rotations and intensive fast-growing plantations. Under similar nutrient availability conditions, sites where nutrient release occurs faster may show higher post-thinning tree growth rates.
23359742|Isotopic data are increasingly being used to quantify and understand the processes that control the release of carbon (C) from northern peatlands. We used  13 C and 14 C measurements to investigate the source and age of different forms of aquatic C (DOC, POC and evasion CO 2 ) released from 2 contrasting (undrained v drained) forested peatland catchments at the end of the winter snowmelt period in boreal E Finland. The  13 CVPDB values of DOC (range -28.3 to -28.8 ) were generally more 13 C depleted than evasion CO 2 (range -22.7 to -31.5 ) and showed no clear differences between the pre-flood, flood and post-flood periods. Both forms of C had evidence of bomb- 14 C (i.e. >100%modern), indicating that they contained substantial quantities of C fixed since the mid AD 1950s. However, DOC was 14 C enriched compared to evasion CO 2 , with 14 C concentrations suggesting that, on average, DOC-C was  56 years younger than evasion CO 2 C, with the most recently fixed C being released when temperatures were highest. POC was significantly depleted in 14 C with conventional (uncalibrated) radiocarbon ages of 8051135 BP. In contrast to other studies, the isotopic compositions of DOC and evasion CO 2 were very similar, suggesting a predominantly single and consistent C source (decomposition of soil organic matter; SOM) during the snowmelt period. Whilst we found no evidence to suggest that old (pre-bomb) C was being released at the end of the winter period, the drained site was associated with more 14 C depleted and 13 C enriched evasion CO 2 , suggesting a closer link to the atmospheric CO 2 pool. Our isotopic data suggest that the various forms of C released to the aquatic system from these forested Finnish peatlands are closely related, largely unaffected by drainage and (at least in the case of evasion CO 2 and DOC) indicate strong connectivity between C cycling in the soilplantwater system.
1469181|We compared denitrification rates obtained using an adaptation of the acetylene block technique to rates estimated from benthic flux nutrient stoichiometry in the subtidal sediments of Tomales Bay, California (USA). By amending whole cores with acetylene and saturating nitrate concentrations, we obtained potential denitrification rates, which ranged between 4 and 30 mmol N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. We determined the apparent Michaelis constant (K<sub>app</sub>) and the maximum potential rate (V<sub>mp</sub>) of the denitrifying community and used these constants in a rectangular hyperbola to estimate in situ denitrification rates. Both the K<sub>app</sub> and V<sub>mp</sub> of the denitrifying community exhibited significant variation over both depth in the sediment column and time of sampling. Estimates of in situ denitrification obtained using our 'kinetic-fix' adaptation of the acetylene block ranged between 1.8 (March) and 9 (Sept.) mmol N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Denitrification rates obtained using benthic flux stoichiometry ranged between 0.7 and 4.1 mmol N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Average denitrification rates obtained using the 'kinetic-fix' acetylene block approach exceeded those obtained from net benthic flux stoichiometry; however, these differences were not significant. We conclude that our 'kinetic-fix' adaptation of the acetylene block technique provides realistic estimates of denitrification in sediments, even when pore water nitrate concentrations are low and nitrification and denitrification are closely coupled.
1468622| Total S concentration in the top 35 cm of Big Run Bog peat averaged 9.7  mol g-wet mass<sup>-1</sup> (123  mol g dry mass<sup>-1</sup>). Of that total, an average of 80.8% was carbon bonded S, 10.4% was ester sulfate S, 4.5% was FeS<sub>2</sub>-S, 2.7% was FeS-S, 1.2% was elemental S, and 0.4% was SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-S. In peat collected in March 1986, injected with <sup>35</sup>S-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and incubated at 4 C, mean rates of dissimilatory sulfate reduction (formation of H<sub>2</sub>S + S<sup>0</sup> + FeS + FeS<sub>2</sub>), carbon bonded S formation, and ester sulfate S formation averaged 3.22, 0.53, and 0.36 nmol g wet mass<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Measured rates of sulfide oxidation were comparable to rates of sulfate reduction. Although dissolved SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in Big Run Bog interstitial water (< 200 M) are low enough to theoretically limit sulfate reducing bacteria, rates of sulfate reduction integrated throughout the top 30-35 cm of peat of 9 and 34 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> (at 4 C) are greater than or comparable to rates in coastal marine sediments. We suggest that sulfate reduction was supported by a rapid turnover of the dissolved SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> pool (average turnover time of 1.1 days). Although over 90% of the total S in Big Run Bog peat was organic S, cycling of S was dominated by fluxes through the inorganic S pools. 
1468666| The  <sup>13</sup>C signature of organic carbon in estuarine bottom sediment in Louisiana Barataria Basin was used for estimating carbon flux from adjacent marsh. The stable carbon isotope composition of plants, soils and sediments from the basin were determined. The  <sup>13</sup>C content of marsh vegetation ranged from - 26.3 to - 27.8 for C<sub>3</sub> freshwater vegetation in the upper basin to - 13.0 to - 13.3 for C<sub>4</sub> vegetation in the lower basin. The  <sup>13</sup>C content of the highly organic marsh soils were similar to  <sup>13</sup>C content of vegetation present. The  <sup>13</sup>C content of organic carbon from bottom sediment of open water bodies ranged from 27.3 in the upper basin (freshwater) to 16.4 in bottom sediment of salt marsh ponds. The <sup>13</sup>C signature of organic carbon in bottom sediment from saline regions corresponded to the size of the body of water. The smaller salt marsh ponds contain sediment with  <sup>13</sup>C values close to that of the C<sub>4</sub> plant Spartina alterniflora. Results suggest that phytoplankton rather than Spartina alterniflora is the likely organic source in bottom sediment of the larger bay near the coast (e.g. Caminada Bay). 
1469586|We studied the seasonality of total soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux and labeled C-CO<sub>2</sub> released from <sup>14</sup>C labeled straw incubated in the H horizon of a semi-arid Mediterranean forest soil. Field measurements were carried out over 520 days in a series of reconstructed soil profiles with and without a gravel layer below the H horizon. We monitored soil climate and related this to soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux. Seasonal variations in soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux in a semiarid Mediterranean forest were mainly related to changes in soil temperature. In spite of drought, high respiration rates were observed in mid summer. High soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux in hot and dry episodes was attributed to increases in soil biological activity. The minimum soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux occurred in late summer also under dry conditions, probably related to a decrease in soil biological activity in deep horizons. Biological activity in organic layers was limited by water potential () in summer and by temperature in winter. Rewetting a dry soil resulted in large increases in soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux only at high temperatures. These large increases represented a significant contribution to the decomposition of organic matter in the uppermost horizons. Soil biological activity in the uppermost horizons was more sensitive to changes in soil  and hence to summer rainstorms than the bulk soil microbial activity. The presence of a layer of gravel improved both moisture and temperature conditions for the decomposition of organic matter. As a result, soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux increased in soils containing rock fragments. These effects were especially large for the organic layers.
1469539| We examined forms of solid phosphorus fractions in intertidal marsh sediments along a salinity (0-22) gradient in a river-dominated estuary and in a marine-dominated salt marsh with insignificant freshwater input. Freshwater marsh sediments had the highest ratio of organic N:P of between 28:1 and 47:1 mol:mol, compared to 21:1 to 31:1 mol:mol in the saltmarshes, which is consistent with a trend toward P-limitation of primary production in freshwater and N-limitation in salt marshes. However, total P concentration, 24.7  11.1 mol P g dw<sup>-1</sup> (1 SD) averaged over the upper meter of sediment, was greatest in the freshwater marsh where bioavailablity of P is apparently limited. In the freshwater marsh the greatest fraction of total P (24-51%) was associated with humic acids, while the importance of humic-P decreased with increasing salinity to 1-23% in the salt marshes. Inorganic P contributed considerably less to total sediment P in the freshwater marsh (15-40%) than in the salt marshes (33-85%). In reduced sediments at all sites, phosphate bound to aluminum oxides and clays was an important inorganic P pool irrespective of salinity. Inorganic P associated with ferric iron [Fe(III)] phases was most abundant in surface sediments of freshwater and brackish marshes, while Ca-bound P dominated inorganic P pools in the salt marshes. Thus, our results showed that particle-bound P in marsh sediments exhibited changes in chemical association along the salinity gradient of an estuarine system, which is a likely consequence of changes in ionic strength and the availability of iron and calcium. 
24715344|Lipid biomarkers [fatty acids (FAs), sterols and alcohols] and total organic carbon (TOC) were analyzed in 48 surface (02 cm) sediment samples collected twice (winter 2008/2009 and summer/2009) in two transects ranging from 25 to 3,000 m depths. This sampling array encompassed the major upwelling region in the southeastern Brazilian continental margin, where the river influence is probably minimal. The objectives were (1) to evaluate the sources, transport and major areas of organic matter (OM) accumulation in the continental margin and (2) to identify the fraction of OM that is potentially available to secondary benthic producers. As expected from the regional oceanographic characteristics, lipids derived from primary and secondary autochthonous producers (0.0735.3 mg gTOC) made the major fraction of the sedimentary OM, whereas lipids from allochthonous sources (0.0430.40 mg gTOC) and from bacteria (<0.010.43 mg gTOC) were of relatively less importance. The accumulation of OM in the sediments was highly dependent on the coupling of physical (hydrodynamics) and biological (response to upwelling) factors. It was found that while some restricted areas in the shelf was a sink of labile OM, the export of this material to the upper and middle slope (4001,000 m depths) can represent an important source of bioavailable OM to the deep sea benthic community.
24715203|Wetlands are estimated to contribute nearly 40 % of global annual methane (CH) emissions to the atmosphere. However, because CH fluxes from these systems vary spatially, seasonally, and by wetland type, there is a large uncertainty associated with scaling up the CH flux from these environments. We monitored seasonal patterns of CH cycling from tidal mudflat wetland sediments adjacent to a vegetated freshwater wetland in coastal Georgia between 2008 and 2009. CH emissions were significantly correlated with CH production and sediment saturation state with respect to CH but not with temperature. CH cycling displayed distinct seasonal patterns. Winter months were characterized by low CH production and emissions. During the spring, summer and fall, CH fluxes exceeded CH production in the top 40 cm. Comparison of CH sources and sinks in conjunction with the interpretation of CH concentration profiles using a 1D reactive transport model indicated that CH delivered via lateral tidal pumping likely provided additional CH to the upper sediment column. Seasonally high CH ebullition rates reflected increased CH production and decreased CH solubility. The annual CH flux was estimated to be on the order of 10 mol CH m y which is 24 times the global average for wetland CH emissions. Thus, even though tidal freshwater mudflats are of limited spatial extent, these environments may serve as globally significant sources of CH to the atmosphere. This study highlights the importance of these dynamic environments to the global CH cycle and their relevance to climate change.
24716792|Humid tropical forests play a dominant role in many global biogeochemical cycles, yet long-term records of tropical stream chemistry and its response to disturbance events such as severe storms and droughts are rare. Here we document the long-term variability in chemistry of two streams in the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico over a period of 27 years. Our two focal study watersheds, the Ro Icacos and Quebrada Sonadora, both drain several hundred hectares of tropical wet forests, and each received direct hits from Hurricanes Hugo (1989) and Georges (1998). They differ primarily in lithology (granitic vs. volcaniclastic) and elevation. Changes in major cations, anions, silica, and dissolved organic carbon were minimal over the study period, but the concentrations of nitrate show a strong response to hurricane disturbance and the longest time to recovery. Potassium also showed a large, although less consistent, response to disturbance. In the granitic terrain, nitrate concentrations exceeded long-term pre-hurricane background levels for over a decade, but were elevated in the volcaniclastic terrain for only 12 years. Lithology appears to be the primary driver explaining the different response trajectories of the two watersheds. In the granitic terrain, which showed slow recovery to prehurricane conditions, the quartz diorite bedrock weathers to produce coarser soils, deeper groundwater flow paths, and riparian zones with sharp spatial variation in redox conditions and very high nitrogen levels immediately adjacent to the stream. Groundwater flow paths are shallow and the levels of N in streamside groundwater are much lower in the volcaniclastic terrain. The recovery of vegetation following hurricane disturbance appears similar in the two watersheds, suggesting that the extent of structural damage to canopy trees determines the magnitude of NO increases, but that the duration of elevated concentrations in stream water is a function of lithology.
1469518| We examined spatial and temporal variations in soil chemistry in a floodplain forest landscape to determine the effects of flooding on aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) oxide biogeochemistry and inorganic phosphorus (P<sub>i</sub>) sorption capacity. When previously sorbed P<sub>i</sub> was considered, the sorption capacities of floodplain and adjacent upland soils were comparable, suggesting that floodplain soils represent a second line of defense protecting downstream aquatic ecosystems from agricultural run-off. P<sub>i</sub> sorption capacity was highly correlated with oxalate-extractable Al (Al<sub>o</sub>) (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.78); Al<sub>o</sub> and percent organic matter (OM) were also highly correlated (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.72), suggesting the importance of OM-Al complexes in these soils. The correlation of oxalate-extractable Fe (Fe<sub>o</sub>) with OM (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.64) was improved (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.80) by removing lower elevation (swale) soils, suggesting that flooding inhibits the association of Fe<sub>o</sub> with OM. Fe oxide crystallinity decreased during seasonal flooding, but total extractable Fe did not change significantly. Fe solubilized during flooding was either replaced by sediment deposition (252  3 mmol kg<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), and/or reprecipitated locally. Al oxide crystallinity also decreased during flooding due to a significant decline in NaOH-extractable Al (Al<sub>N</sub>). Al<sub>N</sub> concentrations subsequently returned to pre-flooding levels, but sediment Al inputs (57  3 mmol kg<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), were insufficient to account for this recovery. Observed Fe transformations suggest the importance of flooding-induced declines in soil redox potential to Fe biogeochemistry; observed Al transformations suggest the importance of complexation reactions with soil OM to Al biogeochemistry in this floodplain forest. 
1468703|Changes in vegetation, litter, and soil nutrient content were measured in selected plots on Walker Branch watershed, Tennessee, from 1972-73 to 1982. The watershed has been allowed to revert to forest since 1942, before which it consisted of small subsistence farms and woodland pastures. Changes in Ca status were of particular interest because initial nutrient cycling characterizations indicated that net Ca accumulation in vegetation could have caused large decreases in soil exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> within 20 years. Decreases in forest floor and subsoil (45-60 cm) N, exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> content were noted in several plots from 1972 to 1982. Surface soils (0-15 cm) showed either no change or, in some cases (e.g., N and exchangeable K<sup>+</sup> in certain plots), increases over the 11-year period. Reductions in forest floor and subsoil exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> and exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup> on cherty, upper slope oak-hickory and chestnut oak forests were most striking. The changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> are thought to be due primarily to high rates of Ca incorporation into woody tissues of oak and hickory species. Reductions in forest floor and subsoil exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup> could not be accounted for by woody increment; leaching may have played a major role in causing these decreases. Changes in P and exchangeable K<sup>+</sup> were variable, with both increases and decreases. There were significant increases in exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup> in both subsoils and surface soils of certain plots, but these were not accompanied by decreases in exchangeable base cations or consistent decreases in pH. Dissolution of interlayer Al from 2:1 clays may be the cause of the exchangeable Al<sup>3+</sup> increases. These results suggest a general decline in fertility, especially with regard to Ca and Mg in those forests with low soil Ca and Mg supplies. Monitoring of further changes (if any) in these ecosystems will continue as the currently aggrading forests approach steady state.
1469099|In this study we investigated the spatial and temporal variation in soil solution chemistry and of water and ion fluxes through the soil in a forest ecosystem. Our aim was to evaluate the relevance of these variations for the accuracy of average areal soil solution concentrations and ion fluxes with seepage at 90 cm depth. Twenty spatially distinct 'subcompartments' of approximately 1 m<sup>2</sup> were established within a mature stand of Norway spruce and ceramic suction lysimeters were installed at depths of 20, 35 and 90 cm. A tensiometer was placed close to each suction lysimeter, and one throughfall sampler was established for each subcompartment. Soil solution samples were analysed for major ions (H<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>). We calculated water fluxes for each subcompartment separately by a numeric simulation of the soil water flux close to the lysimeters. The ion fluxes at each lysimeter were calculated by multiplying the simulated water fluxes with the ion concentrations on a fortnightly base. Averaging these 20 independent ion fluxes gave the areal average flux and an estimate of its statistical accuracy. The spatial variation of ion concentrations in the soil solution was high with coefficients of variance ranging from 5% to 128%. Part of the spatial variation was related to stem distance. Temporal variation of the concentrations was less than spatial for most ions. The spatial variation of water and ion fluxes with seepage was also substantial; for example the fluxes of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-S calculated for each subcompartment ranged from 21 to 119 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, with an arithmetic average of 47 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. For H<sub>2</sub>O, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, the spatial heterogeneity of seepage fluxes was largely explained by the heterogeneity of throughfall fluxes. No such relationship was found for nitrogen. Despite using 20 replicates, the 95% confidence intervals of the average annual areal fluxes with seepage were found to be 20-30% for most ions.
1469118|The hydrology and elemental transport within five low order Precambrian shield catchments was investigated during 1988-90. Catchments were subdivided and instrumented to examine the vertical and horizontal fluxes of elements within and between two distinct landscape types: open, lichen-covered bedrock outcrops and patches of conifer forest. The dominant hydrologic pathways were Horton overland flow in the lichen-bedrock areas and shallow subsurface flow through organic rich LFH (forest floor) and Ah soil horizons in the forested areas. Annual runoff coefficients ranged from 0.3 to 0.7. Runoff chemistry was acidic (pH 4.01-4.72), with organic anion equivalents (RCOO<sup>-</sup>), comprising 60 and 69% of the anion charge total for bedrock and forest runoff, respectively. Forested plots exported more H<sup>+</sup> (2.6x), DOC (1.4x), Al (1.6x) and Fe (1.8x) and less N (0.40x), P (0.13x), particulate C (0.08x), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.38x), Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0.83x), Na<sup>+</sup> (0.85x) and K<sup>+</sup> (0.32x) per unit area than the bedrock-lichen plots. The catchments exhibited a net export of H<sup>+</sup> (34), Mg<sup>2+</sup> (24), Na<sup>+</sup> (20), K<sup>+</sup> (4) (units in eq ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and C (16), Si (5.6), Al (1.6) and Fe (0.47) (units kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). The catchments retained N (5.66), P (0.08), Mn (0.03) (units kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (37), and Cl<sup>-</sup> (3) (units eq ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). The strong retention of Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the treed soil islands resulted in extremely low export rates of base cations (-15 to 38 eq ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). The spatial distribution and hydrologic and biogeochemical linkages associated with each landscape unit interact to control element transport within the study catchments.
1468588|Storage and flux of nitrogen were studied in several contrasting lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta spp. latifolia) forests in southeastern Wyoming. The mineral soil contained most of the N in these ecosystems (range of 315-860 g m<sup>-2</sup>), with aboveground detritus (37.5-48.8 g m<sup>-2</sup>) and living biomass (19.5-24.0 g m<sup>-2</sup>) storing much smaller amounts. About 60-70% of the total N in vegetation was aboveground, and N concentrations in plant tissues were unusually low (foliage = 0.7% N), as were N input via wet precipitation (0.25 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), and biological fixation of atmospheric N (<latex>$<0.03\ \text{g}\cdot \text{m}^{-2}\cdot \text{yr}^{-1}$</latex>, except locally in some stands at low elevations where symbiotic fixation by the leguminous herb Lupinus argenteus probably exceeded 0.1 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Because of low concentrations in litterfall and limited opportunity for leaching, N accumulated in decaying leaves for 6-7 yr following leaf fall. This process represented an annual flux of about 0.5 g m<sup>-2</sup> to the 01 horizon. Only 20% of this flux was provided by throughfall, with the remaining 0.4 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> apparently added from layers below. Low mineralization and small amounts of N uptake from the 02 are likely because of minimal rooting in the forest floor (as defined herein) and negligible mineral N (<latex>$<0.05\ \text{mg}\cdot \text{L}^{-1}$</latex>) in 02 leachate. A critical transport process was solubilization of organic N, mostly 'fulvic acids'. Most of the organic N from the forest floor was retained within the major tree rooting zone (0-40 cm), and mineralization of soil organic N provided NH<sub>4</sub> for tree uptake. Nitrate was at trace levels in soil solutions, and a long lag in nitrification was always observed under disturbed conditions. Total root nitrogen uptake was calculated to be 1.25 gN m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> with estimated root turnover of 0.37- gN m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and the soil horizons appeared to be nearly in balance with respect to N. The high demand for mineralized N and the precipitation of fulvic acid in the mineral soil resulted in minimal deep leaching in most stands (<latex>$<0.02\ \text{g}\cdot \text{m}^{-2}\cdot \text{yr}^{-1}$</latex>). These forests provide an extreme example of nitrogen behavior in dry, infertile forests.
1469397| Fluxes of dissolved and particulate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from three adjacent watersheds were quantified with a high-resolution sampling program over a five-year period. The watersheds vary by an order of magnitude in area (12,875, 7968 and 1206 ha), and in all three watersheds intensive agriculture comprises > 90% of land. Annual fluxes of dissolved N and P per unit watershed area (export coefficients) varied 2X among watersheds, and patterns were not directly related to watershed size. Over the five-year period, mean annual flux of soluble reactive P (SRP) was 0.583 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> from the smallest watershed and 0.295 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> from the intermediate-sized watershed, which had the lowest SRP flux. Mean annual flux of nitrate was 20.53 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the smallest watershed and 44.77 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the intermediate-sized watershed, which had the highest nitrate flux. As a consequence, the export ratio of dissolved inorganic N to SRP varied from 80 (molar) in the smallest watershed to 335 in the intermediate-sized watershed. Because most N was exported as nitrate, differences among watersheds in total N flux were similar to those for nitrate. Hence, the total N:P export ratio was 42 (molar) for the smallest watershed and 109 for the intermediate-sized watershed. In contrast, there were no clear differences among watersheds in the export coefficients of particulate N, P, or carbon, even though > 50% of total P was exported as particulate P in all watersheds. All nutrient fractions were exported at higher rates in wet years than in dry years, but precipitation-driven variability in export coefficients was greater for particulate fractions than for dissolved fractions. Examination of hydrological regimes showed that, for all nutrient fractions, most export occurred during stormflow. However, the proportion of nitrate flux exported as baseflow was much greater than the proportion of SRP flux exported as baseflow, for all three watersheds (25-37% of nitrate exported as baseflow vs. 3-13% of SRP exported as baseflow). In addition, baseflow comprised a greater proportion of total discharge in the intermediate-sized watershed (43.7% of total discharge) than the other two watersheds (29.3 and 30.1%). Thus, higher nitrate export coefficients in the intermediate-sized watershed may have resulted from the greater contribution of baseflow in this watershed. Other factors potentially contributing to higher nitrate export coefficients in this watershed may be a thicker layer of loess soils and a lower proportion of riparian forest than the other watersheds. The among-watershed variability in SRP concentrations and export coefficients remains largely unexplained, and might represent the minimum expected variation among similar agricultural watersheds. 
1469263|The forest floor was expected to play a major role in determining the total ecosystem response to watershed liming because of its high concentration of nutrients and its high level of activity. Net N mineralization and net nitrification were estimated in a field survey using the buried-bag approach. In a laboratory incubation experiment, forest floor humus was mixed with 6 doses of lime to determine the sensitivity of N mineralization and nitrification to lime dose. Forest floor microcosms with and without live tree roots were used to calculate a N budget for the system. The pH of the forest floor increased from 3.6 to 4.9 in the Oe and to 4.0 in the Oa two years after liming. The extractable ammonium pool in both the field survey and microcosm study was substantially smaller after liming and was probably a result of the 36% to 55% lower net N mineralization rate in limed plots than in reference plots. The laboratory incubation results agreed with the field survey results and further demonstrated that at higher lime doses (pH 5 to 6), N mineralization increased above controls. Net nitrification in limed humus in both the buried bags and laboratory incubation was as much as three times higher than controls, which could explain why nitrate leaching in limed microcosms was greater than in control microcosms. However, nitrate leaching from microcosms with live roots was not affected by liming, suggesting that roots in the forest floor may prevent excess nitrate leaching. Reductions in N mineralization had no effect on N leaching or N uptake, but reduced the extractable ammonium pool.
20456564|In order to evaluate the role of photochemistry in the carbon dioxide (CO) generation from a 10-year-old boreal reservoir, the photomineralization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was assessed and compared to a boreal river as well as to boreal and temperate lakes during July and August, 2003. Sterile water samples were irradiated by sunlight over the whole photoperiod and subsequently analyzed for CO. Mean energy-normalized apparent photochemical yield of CO (an index of DOM photoreactivity normalized for the energy absorbed by samples) was significantly higher in the reservoir (27.7  13.0 mg COmkJ) and the boreal river (35.8  2.3 mg COmkJ) than in the boreal lakes (15.5  5.1 mg COmkJ). The DOM photoreactivity of the temperate lakes (20.9  8.1 mg COmkJ) was not statistically different from any type of boreal water bodies. There was no significant difference in either the integrated photoproduction of CO (273-433 mg COmd) or the potential photochemical contribution to CO diffusive fluxes (56-92%) among these water bodies. DOM photoreactivity was significantly affected by the cumulative hydrological residence time (CHRT) when considering the whole data set. However, when considering only the boreal water bodies, iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) also intervened. The fact that DOM photoreactivity was related to CHRT as well as to Fe and Mn concentrations, which are respectively permanent and long-lasting features of the reservoir, suggests that the photoproduction of CO is not likely to decrease over time. This process may therefore play a substantial role in the long-term CO emissions from boreal reservoirs during the summer, its potential contribution to CO diffusive fluxes being estimated at 56  29%.
1468598|Elevated concentrations of Al have been observed in acidic surface waters. An assessment of the chemistry of aqueous Al is of interest because of its role as a toxicant to aquatic organisms, a pH buffer, and an adsorbent of orthophosphate and organic carbon. In this investigation we evaluated the spatial and temporal fluctuations of Al forms in an acidic drainage lake. High concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (51.0 11  mol l<sup>-1</sup>), H<sup>+</sup> (14.9 3.5  mol l<sup>-1</sup>), and Al (19.6 3.5  mol l<sup>-1</sup>) were introduced to Dart's Lake through drainage water during the snowmelt period. During low flow periods microbially mediated depletions of nitrate served to neutralize H<sup>+</sup> and aluminum base neutralizing capacity. Thus in Dart's Lake, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transformations were extremely important in regulating short-term changes in pH and subsequent changes in the inorganic forms of Al. During stratification periods Al appeared to be non-conservative within the lake system. Although we know very little about the character and transformations of alumino-organic solutes, these substances were correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Alumino-organic substances appear to be introduced to the lake from both drainage water and sediments.
41410602|The present study evaluated nitrogen (N) input and output in mainland China using updated data of temporally and spatially-based land use maps and statistical data at national and provincial scales. The total N inputs increased from 3,081 kg km in 1985 to 5,426 kg km in 2007. Chemical fertilizer dominated the N input and showed an increasing trend. Biological N fixation was the second important N input till 1990 and atmospheric deposition became the second most important source after that, accounting for 24.0% in 2007. There was no net N input through food/feed import in 1985, but it accounted for 3.5% of the total N input in 2007. According to a mass balance model, we assumed total N input equal to output. The results showed that more than half of the total N was denitrified or stored in the system. Ammonia volatilization accounted for 18.9-22.9% of the total N input, and N export to water bodies accounted for 17.9-20.7%. About 5.1-7.7% of the N input was emitted to the atmosphere through biomass burning. When calculated per unit area, total N input, N export to water bodies, denitrification and storage could be very well explained by human population density. Nitrogen input and major outputs were also positively related to per capita gross domestic product and the percentage of total land area used as cropland. The N budget is compared to that of some other countries and the environmental impacts of the N cycle is discussed.
1468822|Within a long-term research project studying the biogeochemical budget of an oak-beech forest ecosystem in the eastern part of the Netherlands, the nitrogen transformations and solute fluxes were determined in order to trace the fate of atmospherically deposited NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and to determine the contribution of nitrogen transformations to soil acidification. The oak-beech forest studied received an annual input of nitrogen via throughfall and stemflow of 45 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, mainly as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, whereas 8 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> was taken up by the canopy. Due to the specific hydrological regime resulting in periodically occurring high groundwater levels, denitrification was found to be the dominant output flux (35 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). N<sub>2</sub>O emmission rate measurements indicated that 57% of this gaseous nitrogen loss (20 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) was as N<sub>2</sub>O. The forest lost an annual amount of 11 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> via streamwater output, mainly as NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Despite the acid conditions, high nitrification rates were measured. Nitrification occurred mainly in the litter layer and in the organic rich part of the mineral soil and was found to be closely correlated with soil temperature. The large amount of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> deposited on the forest floor via atmospheric deposition and produced by mineralization was to a large extent nitrified in the litter layer. Almost no NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> reached the subsurface soil horizons. The NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was retained, taken up or transformed mainly in the mineral soil. A small amount of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (9 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) was removed from the system in streamwater output. A relatively small amount of nitrogen was measured in the soil water as Dissolved Organic Nitrogen. On the basis of these data the proton budget of the system was calculated using two different approaches. In both cases net proton production rates were high in the vegetation and in the litter layer of the forest ecosystem. Nitrogen transformations induced a net proton production rate of 2.4 kmol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the soil compartment.
40980895|Constructed wetlands are commonly used for treatment of municipal sewage. The treatment is usually aimed at removal of organics, suspended solids, nutrients and microbial pollution. The information on removal and fate of heavy metals is very limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of sediments and heavy metal concentration in the sediments in filtration beds of seven constructed wetlands with horizontal subsurface flow treating municipal sewage with various length of operation. The results revealed that concentrations of Cd, Ni, Pb, Cu, Cr and Zn in the sediment are mostly comparable with concentrations occurred in natural unpolluted or slightly polluted wetlands. The concentrations are much lower than those found in wetlands impacted with mine drainage waters or wastewater from industrial operations. Concentrations of studied heavy metals exceeded only occasionally limits set by the Czech legislation. However, when heavy metal concentrations are evaluated within the filtration material the concentrations are well below the limits set for soils in the Czech Republic. The results also revealed that concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment do not reflect the time of operation probably due to buildup of sediments from suspended solids contained in wastewaters. However, the sediment mass increases during the course of operation and consequently the metal mass increases as well.
20055167|Chlorine is a minor constituent of most rocks and a minor (although essential) element in plants, but it cycles rapidly through the hydrosphere and atmosphere. In forest ecosystem studies, chloride ion (Cl) is often thought to be conservative in the sense that the sources and sinks within the ecosystem are assumed negligible compared to inputs and outputs. As such, Cl is often used as a conservative tracer to assess sources and transformations of other ions. In this paper we summarize research on chloride over the course of 36 years (1964-2000) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in central New Hampshire, USA. Evidence presented here suggests that in the 1960s and 1970s the dominant source of atmospheric Cl deposition was from pollutant sources, probably coal burning. In the 1970s the Cl inputs in bulk deposition declined, and the lower Cl deposition in the last two decades is dominated by marine sources. Between 1964 and 2000 there was no significant trend in Cl export in stream flow, thus the net hydrologic flux (NHF = bulk deposition inputs - streamflow outputs) has changed over this period. Early in the record the NHF was on average positive, indicating net retention of Cl within the system, but since about 1980 the NHF has been consistently negative, indicating an unmeasured input or source within the ecosystem. Dry deposition can account for at least part of that unmeasured source, and it appears that release of Cl from mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) may also play an important role. We believe that accumulation of Cl in vegetation during the 1960s and 1970s offset the unmeasured source and resulted in net ecosystem retention. Accumulation of vegetative biomass has ceased since about 1982, leading to the apparent net export (negative NHF) since that time. Although we have no direct measurements of Cl accumulation in vegetation, our estimates suggest that an aggrading forest could sequester about 32 mol Cl
1468692|We examined the importance of nitrogen inputs from groundwater and runoff in a small coastal marine cove on Cape Cod, MA, USA. We evaluated groundwater inputs by three different methods: a water budget, assuming discharge equals recharge; direct measurements of discharge using bell jars; and a budget of water and salt at the mouth of the Cove over several tidal cycles. The lowest estimates were obtained by using a water budget and the highest estimates were obtained using a budget of water and salt at the Cove mouth. Overall there was more than a five fold difference in the freshwater inputs calculated by using these methods. Nitrogen in groundwater appears to be largely derived from on site septic systems. Average nitrate concentrations were highest in the region where building density was greatest. Nitrate in groundwater appeared to behave conservatively in sandy sediments where groundwater flow rates were high (<latex>$>11/\text{m}^{2}/\text{h}$</latex>), indicating that denitrification was not substantially reducing external nitrogen loading to the Cove. Nitrogen inputs from groundwater were approximately 300 mmol-N/m<sup>3</sup>/y of Cove water. Road runoff contributed an additional 60 mmol/m<sup>3</sup>/y. Total nitrogen inputs from groundwater and road runoff to this cove were similar in magnitude to river dominated estuaries in urbanized areas in the United States.
1469629| Sulfate microbial immobilization and the mineralization of organic S were measured in vitro in soil horizons (LFH, Ae, Bhf, Bf and C) of the Lake Laflamme watershed (47 17 N, 71 14 O) using <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub>. LFH samples immobilized from 23 to 77% of the added <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> within 2 to 11 days. The <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> microbial immobilization increased with temperature and reached an asymptote after a few days. The mineral soil generally immobilized less than 20% of the added <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub>, and an asymptote was reached after 2 days. An isotopic equilibrium was rapidly reached in mineral horizons. A two-compartment (SO<sub>4</sub> and organic S) model adequately described <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> microbial immobilization kinetics. The active organic reservoir in the whole soil profile represented less than 1% of the total organic S. The average concentrations of dissolved organic S (DOS) in the soil solutions leaving the LFH, Bhf and Bf horizons were respectively 334, 282 and 143  g.L<sup>-1</sup>. Assuming that the DOS decrease with soil depth corresponded to the quantities adsorbed in the B horizons, we estimated that 12 800 kg.ha<sup>-1</sup> of organic S could have been formed since the last glaciation, which is about 13 times the size of the actual B horizons reservoirs. Our results suggest that the organic S reservoirs present in mineral forest soils are mostly formed by the DOS adsorption resulting from incomplete litter decomposition in the humus layer. The capability of these horizons to immobilize SO<sub>4</sub> from the soil solution would be restricted to a 1% active fraction composed of microorganisms. Despite their refractory nature, these reservoirs can, however, be slowly decomposed by microorganisms and contribute to the S-SO<sub>4</sub> export from the watershed in the long term. 
20456474|The ubiquity and high productivity associated with blooms of colonial Phaeocystis makes it an important contributor to the global carbon cycle. During blooms organic matter that is rich in carbohydrates is produced. We distinguish five different pools of carbohydrates produced by Phaeocystis. Like all plants and algal cells, both solitary and colonial cells produce (1) structural carbohydrates, (hetero) polysaccharides that are mainly part of the cell wall, (2) mono- and oligosaccharides, which are present as intermediates in the synthesis and catabolism of cell components, and (3) intracellular storage glucan. Colonial cells of Phaeocystis excrete (4) mucopolysaccharides, heteropolysaccharides that are the main constituent of the mucous colony matrix and (5) dissolved organic matter (DOM) rich in carbohydrates, which is mainly excreted by colonial cells. In this review the characteristics of these pools are discussed and quantitative data are summarized. During the exponential growth phase, the ratio of carbohydrate-carbon (C) to particulate organic carbon (POC) is approximately 0.1. When nutrients are limited, Phaeocystis blooms reach a stationary growth phase, during which excess energy is stored as carbohydrates. This so-called overflow metabolism increases the ratio of carbohydrate-C to POC to 0.4-0.6 during the stationary phase, leading to an increase in the C/N and C/P ratios of Phaeocystis organic matter. Overflow metabolism can be channeled towards both glucan and mucopolysaccharides. Summarizing the available data reveals that during the stationary phase of a bloom glucan contributes 0-51% to POC, whereas mucopolysaccharides contribute 5-60%. At the end of a bloom, lysis of Phaeocystis cells and deterioration of colonies leads to a massive release of DOM rich in glucan and mucopolysaccharides. Laboratory studies have revealed that this organic matter is potentially readily degradable by heterotrophic bacteria. However, observations in the field of accumulation of DOM and foam indicate that microbial degradation is hampered. The high C/N and C/P ratios of Phaeocystis organic matter may lead to nutrient limitation of microbial degradation, thereby prolonging degradation times. Over time polysaccharides tend to self-assemble into hydrogels. This may have a profound effect on carbon cycling, since hydrogels provide a vehicle to move DOM up the size spectrum to sizes subject to sedimentation. In addition, it changes the physical nature and microscale structure of the organic matter encountered by bacteria which may affect the degradation potential of the Phaeocystis organic matter.
20456579|The total iron (TFe) concentrations in five rivers to a Galician Ria (averages 1.0-4.5 M) was within the pristine range, but in rainwater it was higher (17 M). TFe values of small sewage treatment plants (STP) ranged between 3 and 4 M, whereas in the largest was 11 M. Particulate iron in rivers was five times more abundant than dissolved iron, except in the Lagares where it was 20 times higher, but in the STDs the dissolved/particulate coefficients varied from 0.1 to 1.1 and in the rainwater it was lower than 0.4. Equations of water flow versus iron flux were obtained to quantify the iron contribution from the freshwater sources to the Vigo Ria. It receives annually 490 tons of iron (6% in dissolved form) and 90% of this comes from industries focused on metal processes. The contaminated Lagares River accounts for the main input of TFe (327 t a), followed by rainwater (78 t a), the Oitavn River (28 t a) and Vigo STP (33 t a). Anthropogenic activities have increased the amount of iron flowing into the Ria by roughly ten times and this could upset the biogeochemical cycle in similar coastal systems.
20519897|Fluxes of CO during the snow-covered season contribute to annual carbon budgets, but our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the seasonal pattern and magnitude of carbon emissions in seasonally snow-covered areas is still developing. In a subalpine meadow on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, soil CO fluxes were quantified with the gradient method through the snowpack in winter 2006 and 2007 and with chamber measurements during summer 2007. The CO fluxes of 0.71 mol ms in 2006 and 0.86 mol ms in 2007 are among the highest reported for snow-covered ecosystems in the literature. These fluxes resulted in 156 and 189 g C m emitted over the winter, 30% of the annual soil CO efflux at this site. In general, the CO flux increased during the winter as soil moisture increased. A conceptual model was developed with distinct snow cover zones to describe this as well as the three other reported temporal patterns in CO flux from seasonally snow-covered soils. As snow depth and duration increase, the factor controlling the CO flux shifts from freeze-thaw cycles (zone I) to soil temperature (zone II) to soil moisture (zone III) to carbon availability (zone IV). The temporal pattern in CO flux in each zone changes from periodic pulses of CO during thaw events (zone I), to CO fluxes reaching a minimum when soil temperatures are lowest in mid-winter (zone II), to CO fluxes increasing gradually as soil moisture increases (zone III), to CO fluxes decreasing as available carbon is consumed. This model predicts that interannual variability in snow cover or directional shifts in climate may result in dramatically different seasonal patterns of CO flux from seasonally snow-covered soils.
23359709|The marine -proteobacterium Oceanimonas doudoroffii was shown to have at least three different enzymes, each of which can cleave dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an abundant compatible solute made by different classes of marine phytoplankton. These various DMSP lyases have similarities, but also some differences to those that had been identified in other bacteria. This was demonstrated by cloning each of the corresponding genes and transferring them into other species of bacteria in which backgrounds they conferred the ability to catabolise DMSP, releasing dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as one of the products (Ddd + phenotype; DMSP-dependent DMS). One of these genes resembled dddD, which was in a cluster with other ddd genes variously involved in subsequent steps of DMSP catabolism, in DMSP import and in DMSP-dependent transcriptional regulation. The other two gene products both had sequence similarity to the previously identified DddP lyase. However, these two Oceanimonas DddP polypetides were not particularly similar to each other and were in two different sub-branches compared to those that had been studied in strains of the Roseobacter clade of bacteria. One of these O. doudoroffii enzymes, DddP1, most closely resembled gene products in a disparate group of microbes that included two bacteria, Vibrio orientalis and Puniceispirillum marinum and, more strikingly, some Ascomycete fungi that can catabolise DMSP. Previously, the only bacteria known to have multiple ways to catabolise DMSP were in the Roseobacter clade, which were also the only bacteria that had been shown to have functional DddP DMSP lyases. Thus Oceanimonas doudoroffii is unusual on more than one count and likely acquired its dddD, dddP1 and dddP2 genes by independent horizontal gene transfer events.
1469052| The  <sup>15</sup>N composition of the dominant form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was determined in upland groundwater, riparian groundwater, and stream water of the Barro Branco catchment, Amaznas, Brazil. The  <sup>15</sup>N composition of organic nitrogen in riparian and upland leaf litter was also determined. The data for these waters could be divided into three groups: upland groundwater DIN predominately composed of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> with  <sup>15</sup>N values averaging 6.25  0.9; riparian groundwater DIN primarily composed of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> with  <sup>15</sup>N values averaging 9.17  1.0, and stream water DIN predominately composed of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> with  <sup>15</sup>N values averaging 4.52  0.8. Nitrate samples taken from the stream source and from the stream adjacent to the groundwater transects showed a downstream increase in  <sup>15</sup>N from 1.0 to 4.5. Leaf litter samples averaged 3.5  1.2. The observed patterns in isotopic composition, together with previously observed inorganic nitrogen species and concentration shifts between upland, riparian and stream waters, suggest that groundwater DIN is not the primary source of DIN to the stream. Instead, the isotopic data suggest that remineralization of organic nitrogen within the stream itself may be a major source of stream DIN, and that the majority of DIN entering the stream via groundwater flowpaths is removed at the riparian-stream interface. 
1469347|The translocation and transformation of Al and Si are of paramount importance in the processes of primary-mineral weathering, saprolite formation and soil formation. Geochemical mass balance studies of these processes have often not considered the important role of the biota in cycling of these omnipresent soil elements. In the Calhoun Experimental Forest, SC, we found a mean annual biological uptake of Al and Si of 2.28 and 15.8 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with a mean annual accumulation in aboveground biomass of 0.48 and 2.32 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In the case of Al, net soil leaching from 6 m depth is zero, thus biomass accumulation of Al accounts for the only removal from the soil system. There is an additional internal system mobilization of Al of 6.6 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, in response to biotic inputs of dissolved organic carbon. In the case of Si, net soil leaching to groundwater is 17.26 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The accumulation of Si in aboveground biomass, 2.32 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and in forest floor organic matter, 11.95 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, augments the annual weathering release estimate of Si by an additional 82%. The inclusion of biological cycling of both essential and non-essential mineral elements is important for properly evaluating the biogeochemistry of the earth's crust.
1468742|Most ecosystem models consolidate members of food-webs, e.g. species, into a small number of functional components. Each of these is then described by a single state variable such as biomass. When a multivariate approach incorporating multiple substances within components is substituted for this univariate one, a 'stoichiometric' model is formed. Here we show that the Nitrogen:Phosphorus ratio within zooplankton herbivores varies substantially interspecifically but not intraspecifically. By using stoichiometric theory and recent measurements of the N:P ratio within different zooplankton taxa, we calcualte large differences in ratios of nutrients recycled by different zooplankton species. Finally, we demonstrate that N:P stoichiometry can successfully account for shifts in N- and P-limitation previously observed in whole-lake experiments. Species stoichiometry merges food-web dynamics with biogeochemical cycles to yield new insights.
20519892|Eddy covariance measurements of the surface energy balance and carbon dioxide exchange above high-elevation (3,480 m above sea level) alpine tundra located near Niwot Ridge, Colorado, were compared to simultaneous measurements made over an adjacent subalpine forest over two summers and one winter, from June 9, 2007 to July 3, 2008. The surface energy balance closure at the alpine site averaged 71 and 91%, winter and summer, respectively, due to the high wind speeds, short turbulent flux footprint, and relatively flat ridge-top location of the measurement site. Throughout the year, the alpine site was cooler with higher relative humidity, and had a higher horizontal wind speed, especially in winter, compared to the forest site. Wind direction was persistently downslope at the alpine site (summer and winter, day and night), whereas upslope winds were common at the forest site during summer daytime periods. The latent and sensible heat fluxes were consistently larger in magnitude at the forest site, with the largest differences during summer. The horizontal advective flux of CO at the alpine site averaged 6% of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during summer nights (5% during summer daytime), and was small in relation to the high wind speeds, relatively flat site, and weak sources of CO upwind of the site. The magnitudes and diurnal behavior of the alpine NEE calculated using three methods; eddy-covariance, friction velocity filter, and with advection and storage calculations, gave similar results. The period of net CO uptake (negative NEE) was 100 days at the alpine site with a net uptake of 16 g C m, compared to 208 days at the forest site with a net uptake of 108 g C m, with initiation of net uptake coinciding with air temperatures reaching + 10C. Winter respiration loss at the alpine site was 164 g C m over 271 days, compared to 52 g C m over 175 days at the forest site, with the initiation of net loss coinciding with air temperatures reaching - 10C at each site.
41490553|Although northern temperate forests are generally not considered phosphorus (P) limited, ecosystem P limitation may occur on highly weathered or strongly acidic soils where bioavailable inorganic P is low. In such environments, soil organisms may compensate by increasing the utilization of organic P via the production of extracellular enzymes to prevent limitation. In this study, we experimentally increased available P and/or pH in several acidic eastern deciduous forests underlain by glaciated and unglaciated soils in eastern Ohio, USA. We hypothesized that where inorganic P is low; soil microbes are able to access organic P by increasing production of phosphatase enzymes, thereby overcoming biogeochemical P limitations. We measured surface soil for: available P pools, N mineralization and nitrification rates, total C and N, enzymes responsible for C, N, and P hydrolysis, and microbial community composition (PLFA). Increasing surface soil pH a whole unit had little effect on microbial community composition, but increased N cycling rates in unglaciated soils. Phosphorus additions suppressed phosphatase activities over 60% in the unglaciated soils but were unchanged in the glaciated soils. All treatments had minimal influence on microbial biomass, but available pools of P strongly correlated with microbial composition. Microbes may be dependent on sources of organic P in some forest ecosystems and from a microbial perspective soil pH might be less important overall than P availability. Although our sampling was conducted less than 1 year after treatment initiation, microbial community composition was strongly influenced by available P pools and these effects may be greater than shortterm increases in soil pH.
41490451|Natural chloroform in soil gas below four coniferous forest sites was studied. High concentrations were found within narrow areasHot Spotsvarying from ~25 to > 400 m in size, with chloroform concentrations being typically 20-100 times those in corresponding Low Spots. Attempts to localize Hot Spots by visual inspection with regard to type and density of vegetation failed. Possible differences between Hot and Low Spots could be emission, leaching or degradation of chloroform. However, emissions of chloroform from Hot Spots were ~10 times higher than from Low Spots and similarly the chloroform concentration in groundwater below a Hot Spot was ~10 times higher than below the corresponding Low Spot. No differences in chloroform mineralization rates were observed between sites and incubation of soil cores confirmed a larger net formation of chloroform in the Hot Spots. Various soil parameters were measured in order to compare the soil sampled from Hot and Low Spots. The halogenation degree of organic soil samples was in the same range, although slightly higher in the H-horizon of the Hot Spot. The chloroform formation potential of the soil organic matter showed differences between soil horizons but not between sites. The high levels of chloroform in the Hot Spots are probably best explained by differences in chloroform forming activity caused by an uneven distribution of yet unidentified microorganisms, since differences in soil organic matter quality and in emission, leaching and degradation of chloroform as well as a number of additional soil parameters could be completely ruled out.
24715124|This work aimed to show that the sea bed of two environmentally-different regions of the North Sea varies both spatially and temporally with respect to their biological communities and bioturbation characteristics. The two contrasting sites studied were north of the Dogger Bank (ND) (85 m) and the Oyster Grounds (OG) (45 m). The physical environment varied between and within sites, mainly influenced by sediment chlorophyll a content and water temperature. Our data revealed that the depth of the apparent Redox Potential Discontinuity (aRPD) layer at OG varied between 2.2 cm in February and 6.5 cm in October; evidence of bioturbation activity (e.g., feeding voids) was observed within the sediment profile. In contrast, at the ND site the aRPD values ranged from 1.7 cm in February to 2.5 cm in May and feeding voids and infaunal burrows were restricted to sediment depths far shallower than those observed at OG. Communities at ND were dominated by a number of surficial-sediment dwelling polychaete species (e.g., Notomastus latericeus, capitellids) while those of OG were dominated by the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis, together with significant numbers of deeper-dwelling taxa such as the ghost shrimp Callianassa subterranea and the bivalve mollusc Corbula gibba. Our data imply that regions of the North Sea which experience dissimilar environmental conditions not only possess different infaunal communities but also contrasting seasonal fluctuations and bioturbation capacities. The ecological implications of these findings, including inferences for carbon and nutrient cycling, are discussed in relation to the wider North Sea ecosystem.
1468677|Nitrogen flux data was synthesized in developing a nitrogen flow budget for a Louisiana Barataria Basin Spartina alterniflora salt marsh. Results demonstrate the importance of spatial consideration in developing a nitrogen budget for coastal marshes. Using a mass balance approach nitrogen inputs balanced nitrogen sinks or losses from a marsh soil-plant system with a specific rooting depth. However, per unit areas on a local scale, marshes serve as a large sink for nitrogen due to rapid accretion which removes 17.0 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> through subsidence below the root zone. On a larger spatial scale (regional) it is shown that the marshes do not serve as a large nitrogen sink. The rapid marsh deterioration currently occurring in the rapidly subsiding marshes of the Mississippi River deltaic plain account for a net regional loss of 12.5 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Thus, regionally the net sink is equivalent to only 5 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> as compared to 17.0 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> on a local scale.
20519862|Carbon dioxide is taken up by agricultural crops and released soon after during the consumption of agricultural commodities. The global net impact of this process on carbon flux to the atmosphere is negligible, but impact on the spatial distribution of carbon dioxide uptake and release across regions and continents is significant. To estimate the consumption and release of carbon by humans over the landscape, we developed a carbon budget for humans in the United States. The budget was derived from food commodity intake data for the US and from algorithms representing the metabolic processing of carbon by humans. Data on consumption, respiration, and waste of carbon by humans were distributed over the US using geospatial population data with a resolution of 450  450 m. The average adult in the US contains about 21 kg C and consumes about 67 kg C year which is balanced by the annual release of about 59 kg C as expired CO, 7 kg C as feces and urine, and less than 1 kg C as flatus, sweat, and aromatic compounds. In 2000, an estimated 17.2 Tg C were consumed by the US population and 15.2 Tg C were expired to the atmosphere as CO. Historically, carbon stock in the US human population has increased between 1790 and 2006 from 0.06 Tg to 5.37 Tg. Displacement and release of total harvested carbon per capita in the US is nearly 12% of per capita fossil fuel emissions. Humans are using, storing, and transporting carbon about the Earth's surface. Inclusion of these carbon dynamics in regional carbon budgets can improve our understanding of carbon sources and sinks.
1469803|A reduction in plant cover can lead to an increase in the erosion processes that diminish soil quality. Any rise in temperature resulting from predicted climate changes may aggravate this effect, particularly in semiarid Mediterranean areas. Bearing this in mind, the capacity of a soil to preserve organic matter becomes very important if the soil is to maintain its physical and chemical properties. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen changes were evaluated in a non-disturbed (with natural vegetation) and a disturbed (all vegetation manually clipped to ground level) pine system. Nine years after vegetation removal significant differences (p < 0.01) were found in the soil organic carbon content between plots (top 20 cm), but not in total nitrogen. In the disturbed plot 0.0232 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> of soil organic carbon were lost through erosion and 4.30 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> through mineralization. In the first 48 months after vegetation removal the soil organic carbon content fell from 40.3 to 28.0 g kg<sup>-1</sup>. In the last 60 months of the experiment the amount of organic carbon in the soil fell from 28.0 to 27.7 g kg<sup>-1</sup>. This result was mainly attributable to the intense oxidization, which took place during the first 60 months, of organic matter linked to the coarse soil mineral fraction. Up to the 72<sup>nd</sup> month the losses by erosion were a total of 532.7 g, which rose to 1284.4 g by the end of the experiment (108 months). The effect of vegetation removal in a Mediterranean semiarid area leads to a rapid decline in the amount of organic carbon stored in the soil. Such perturbation is irreversible if left to nature.
20055216|This study uses long-term water chemistry records for a circum-neutral peat stream to reconstruct a 7-year record of dissolved CO and DIC flux from the catchment. Combining catchment flux with a knowledge of in-stream metabolism and gas evasion from the stream surface enables an estimate of the dissolved CO content of water emerging from the peat profile to be made; furthermore, these can be used to estimate soil CO respiration. In this way multi-annual records of CO production can be reconstructed, and therefore inter-annual controls on production examined. The results suggest that: (i) Stream evasion of CO within the catchment varied between 80 and 220 g C/m of stream/yr, while in-stream metabolism produces between 1.0 and 2.9 g C/m of stream/yr: (ii) Export of dissolved CO emerging from the soil profile, above that expected at equilibrium with the atmosphere, varies between 9.6 and 25.6 tonnes, C/km/yr: and (iii) The export of dissolved CO implies a soil respiration rate of between 64.2 and 94.9 tonnes C/km/yr. The inter-annual variation in both dissolved CO flux and soil CO respiration suggests that severe drought has no long-term effect on CO production and that temperature-based models of soil CO respiration will be adequate in all but the severest of summer droughts. The inter-annual variation in CO flux shows that CO production is decoupled from dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production. The decoupling of DOC and dissolved CO production shows that enzymatic-latch production of DOC is an anaerobic process and will not increase soil CO respiration.
1469938| The storage and flux of various mineral and trace elements in soils (0-30 cm depth) were examined in relation to monsoonal rains and fine root biomass in four mangrove forests of different age and type in southern Thailand. The onset of the wet SW monsoon resulted in the percolation and dilution of porewater solutes by rainwater and by less saline tidal water, as indicated by shifts in Eh, pH and porewater SO<sub>4</sub>/Cl ratios. This is contrary to temperate intertidal environments where seasonal patterns of porewater constituents, and biological and biogeochemical activities, are strongly cued to temperature. Fluxes across the soil-water interface were most often not statistically significant. Concentration of dissolved porewater metals were dominated by Fe, Mn, Al, Mo and Zn. The decreasing order of solid-phase element inventories in these soils, on average, was: Al, S, Fe, Na, Mg, K, Ca, N, P, Mn, V, Zn, Cr, Ni, As, Co, Cu, Pb, Mo, Cd and Hg. There were no gradients in concentrations of dissolved or solid-phase elements with increasing soil depth. This phenomenon was attributed to physical and biological processes, including the presence and activities of roots and tidal recharge of soil water. Fine dead roots were storage sites for most mineral and trace elements, as some elements in roots composed a significant fraction (5%) of the total soil pool. Analysis of S and Fe concentration differences between live and dead roots suggested extensive formation of pyrite associated with dead roots; correlation analysis suggested that trace metals coprecipitated with pyrite. An analysis of inventories and release/uptake rates indicate turnover of the N, P, Na and Ca soil pools equivalent to other tropical forests; turnover was slow (decades to centuries) for S, Fe, K and trace elements. Our results indicate that mineral and trace element cycling in these soils are characterized by net storage, with net accumulation of most elements much greater than uptake and release by tree roots. 
1469880| Direct measurements of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) were taken by three different (continuous heat, heat pulse, and ultrasonic) types of automated seepage meters as well as standard Lee-type manually operated meters. SGD flux comparisons and the spatial and temporal variations in groundwater flow were analyzed. Seepage rates measured by the different meters agree relatively well with each other (more than 80% agreement). Comparisons of flux rates as a function of distance offshore using exponential approximations show that more than five measurement locations (200 m offshore) are needed for a precise integrated estimation of SGD offshore within an accuracy of 10%. The dominant period of seepage variations is estimated to be about 12 hours, which closely matches the semidiurnal tides in this area. Our analysis also shows that short duration measurement periods may cause significant underestimates or overestimates of the daily averaged groundwater flow rates (25%-60% difference when the measurement duration is less than 12 hours). Thus, continuous measurements of SGD using automated seepage meters with high time resolution should enable us to evaluate temporal and spatial variations of dissolved material transports via groundwater pathways. Such inputs may affect biogeochemical phenomena in the coastal zone. 
40343586|Measurement of net ecosystem exchange was made using the eddy covariance method above three forests along a north-south climatic gradient in Sweden: Flakaliden in the north, Knottsen in central and Asa in south Sweden. Data were obtained for 2 years at Flakaliden and Knottsen and for one year at Asa. The net fluxes
24715151|Active processes of permafrost thaw in Western Siberia increase the number of soil subsidencies, thermokarst lakes and thaw ponds. In continuous permafrost zones, this process promotes soil carbon mobilisation to water reservoirs, as well as organic matter (OM) biodegradation, which produces a permanent flux of carbon dioxide (CO) to the atmosphere. At the same time, the biogeochemical evolution of aquatic ecosystems situated in the transition zone between continuous permafrost and permafrost-free terrain remains poorly known. In order to better understand the biogeochemical processes that occur in thaw ponds and lakes located in discontinuous permafrost zones, we studied 30 small (1100,000 m) shallow (<1 m depth) lakes and ponds formed as a result of permafrost subsidence and thaw of the palsa bog located in the transition zone between the tundra and forest-tundra (central part of Western Siberia). There is a significant increase in dissolved CO and methane (CH) concentration with decreasing water body surface area, with the largest supersaturation with respect to atmospheric CO and CH in small (<100 m) permafrost depressions filled with thaw water. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), conductivity, and metal concentrations also progressively increase from large lakes to thaw ponds and depressions. As such, small water bodies with surface areas of 1100 m that are not accounted for in the existing lake and pond databases may significantly contribute to CO and CH fluxes to the atmosphere, as well as to the stocks of dissolved trace elements and organic carbon. In situ lake water incubation experiments yielded negligible primary productivity but significant oxygen consumption linked to the mineralisation rate of dissolved OM by heterotrophic bacterioplankton, which produce a net CO flux to the atmosphere of 5  2.5 mol C m year. The most significant result of this study, which has long-term consequences on our prediction of aquatic ecosystem development in the course of permafrost degradation is CO, CH, and DOC concentrations increase with decreasing lake age and size. As a consequence, upon future permafrost thaw, the increase in the number of small water bodies, accompanied by the drainage of large thermokarst lakes to the hydrological network, will likely favour (i) the increase of DOC and colloidal metal stocks in surface aquatic systems, and (ii) the enchancement of CO and CH fluxes from the water surface to the atmosphere. According to a conservative estimation that considers that the total area occupied by water bodies in Western Siberia will not change, this increase in stocks and fluxes could be as high as a factor of ten.
40343558|We examined the hydrologie controls on nitrogen biogeochemistry in the hyporheic zone of the Tanana River, a glacially-fed river, in interior Alaska. We measured hyporheic solute concentrations, gas partial pressures, water table height, and flow rates along subsurface flowpaths on two islands for three summers. Denitrification was quantified using an in situ
1468801|The transformations of soil organic phosphorus are described and organized in a conceptual model. Microbial uptake of P and its subsequent release and redistribution play a central role in the soil organic P cycle. Interactions with soil minerals and stabilization of organic matter and associated P in organo-mineral complexes determine the persistence and buildup of organic P through soil development, in different ecosystems and under varying management. An understanding of organic P turnover in soils will greatly aid assessment of P fertility in many agricultural and native systems.
24715192|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an essential component of the carbon cycle and a critical driver in controlling variety of biogeochemical and ecological processes in wetlands. The quality of this DOM as it relates to composition and reactivity is directly related to its sources and may vary on temporal and spatial scales. However, large scale, long-term studies of DOM dynamics in wetlands are still scarce in the literature. Here we present a multi-year DOM characterization study for monthly surface water samples collected at 14 sampling stations along two transects within the greater Everglades, a subtropical, oligotrophic, coastal freshwater wetland-mangrove-estuarine ecosystem. In an attempt to assess quantitative and qualitative variations of DOM on both spatial and temporal scales, we determined dissolved organic carbon (DOC) values and DOM optical properties, respectively. DOM quality was assessed using, excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Variations of the PARAFAC components abundance and composition were clearly observed on spatial and seasonal scales. Dry versus wet season DOC concentrations were affected by dry-down and re-wetting processes in the freshwater marshes, while DOM compositional features were controlled by soil and higher plant versus periphyton sources respectively. Peat-soil based freshwater marsh sites could be clearly differentiated from marl-soil based sites based on EEM-PARAFAC data. Freshwater marsh DOM was enriched in higher plant and soil-derived humic-like compounds, compared to estuarine sites which were more controlled by algae- and microbial-derived inputs. DOM from fringe mangrove sites could be differentiated between tidally influenced sites and sites exposed to long inundation periods. As such coastal estuarine sites were significantly controlled by hydrology, while DOM dynamics in Florida Bay were seasonally driven by both primary productivity and hydrology. This study exemplifies the application of long term optical properties monitoring as an effective technique to investigate DOM dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. The work presented here also serves as a pre-restoration condition dataset for DOM in the context of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).
20456535|Currently, more than 10,000 ha of fens have been rewetted to re-establish their function as nutrient sinks in NE Germany. However, field investigations reveal that porewater concentrations of P, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ammonium in rewetted fens are orders of magnitude larger than under pristine conditions. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the reasons behind enhanced P, organic carbon (OC) and ammonium mobilisation due to rewetting by means of a long-term incubation experiment. Highly, moderately and slightly decomposed peat of a drained fen (polder Zarnekow) was incubated under waterlogged conditions. A time course of concentrations of P, DOC, ammonium, sulphate and other dissolved substances was investigated by means of permanently installed dialysis samplers during 54 weeks of incubation. Simultaneously, the concentrations of these dissolved substances were investigated after rewetting of the field site. Before, and at the end of the incubation study, the amounts of bicarbonate-dithionite (BD) and NaOH soluble P and OC of incubated peat samples were determined by a sequential extraction procedure. The highest mobilisation of P, OC and ammonium occurred in the highly decomposed peat. Final concentrations of P, DOC and ammonium reached about 143 M, 46 and 1.9 mM, respectively. The initial sulphate concentrations in the rewetting experiment, as well as in the field investigations, were extremely high and ranged between 3 and 13 mM; however, a complete consumption of sulphate was only observed in highly decomposed peat. In conclusion, the reasons for enhanced P, OC and ammonium mobilisation are increased amounts of redox sensitive substances and enhanced availability of decomposable organic matter in the upper highly decomposed peat horizon. These results should be considered in future rewetting management strategies.
1469686|Organic forms of nitrogen are widespread in the atmosphere and their deposition may constitute a substantive input of atmospheric N to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Recent studies have expanded the pool of available measurements and our awareness of their potential significance. Here, we use these measurements to provide a coherent picture of the processes that produce both oxidized and reduced forms of organic nitrogen in the atmosphere, examine how those processes are linked to human activity and how they may contribute to the N load from the atmosphere to ecosystems. We summarize and synthesize data from 41 measurements of the concentrations and fluxes of atmospheric organic nitrogen (AON). In addition, we examine the contribution of reduced organic nitrogen compounds such as amino acids, bacterial/particulate N, and oxidized compounds such as organic nitrates to deposition fluxes of AON. The percentage contribution of organic N to total N loading varies from site to site and with measurement methodology but is consistently around a third of the total N load with a median value of 30% (Standard Deviation of 16%). There are no indications that AON is a proportionally greater contributor to N deposition in unpolluted environments and there are not strong correlations between fluxes of nitrate and AON or ammonium and AON. Possible sources for AON include byproducts of reactions between NO<sub>x</sub> and hydrocarbons, marine and terrestrial sources of reduced (amino acid) N and the long-range transport of organic matter (dust, pollen etc.) and bacteria. Both dust and organic nitrates such as PAN appear to play an important role in the overall flux of AON to the surface of the earth. For estimates of organic nitrate deposition, we also use an atmospheric chemical transport model to evaluate the spatial distribution of fluxes and the globally integrated deposition values. Our preliminary estimate of the magnitude of global AON fluxes places the flux between 10 and 50 Tg of N per year with substantial unresolved uncertainties but clear indications that AON deposition is an important aspect of local and global atmospheric N budgets and deserves further consideration.
20456420|Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transport/retention was determined in two rain forest streams (Salto, Pantano) draining La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. There, SRP levels can be naturally high due to groundwater enriched by geothermal activity within the surfically dormant volcanic landscape, and subsequently discharged at ambient temperature. Combined field and laboratory approaches simulated high but natural geothermal SRP input with the objective of estimating the magnitude of amended SRP retention within high and low SRP settings and determining the underlying mechanisms of SRP retention. First, we examined short-term SRP retention/transport using combined SRP-conservative tracer additions at high natural in situ concentrations. Second, we attempted to observe a DIN response during SRP amendment as an indicator of biological uptake. Third, we determined SRP release/retention using laboratory sediment assays under control and biologically inhibited conditions. Short-term in-situ tracer-SRP additions indicated retention in both naturally high and low SRP reaches. Retention of added SRP mass in Upper Salto (low SRP) was 17% (7.5 mg-P m h), and 20% (10.9 mg-P m h) in Lower Salto (high SRP). No DIN response in either nitrate or ammonium was observed. Laboratory assays using fresh Lower Salto sediments indicated SRP release (15.4  5.9 g-P g dry wt. h), when incubated in filter sterilized Salto water at ambient P concentration, but retention when incubated in filter sterilized river water amended to 2.0 mg SRP l (233.2  5.8 g-P g dry wt. h). SRP uptake/release was similar in both control- and biocide-treated sediments indicating predominantly abiotic retention. High SRP retention even under biologically saturated conditions, absence of a DIN response to amendment, patterns of desorption following amendment, and similar patterns of retention and release under control and biologically inhibited conditions all indicated predominantly abiotic P flux.
41410605|Phosphorus (P) is an important nutrient in tundra ecosystems that co-limits or in some cases limits primary production. The availability of P is largely driven by soil characteristics, e.g., pH, organic carbon, and abundance of P-sorbing elements such as aluminium (Al) or iron (Fe). We tested how vegetation and soil properties relate to P availability across different tundra vegetation types. The different soil P fractions in the organic horizon were measured and plant foliar nitrogen (N) to P ratio and a plant bioassay was used as indicators of plant nutrient status. Microbial bioassay s were used to study microbial respiration kinetics and in response to carbon, N, and P amendments. The distribution of P fractions differed significantly across vegetation types; labile fractions of P were less abundant in meadow sites compared to heath sites. Calciumphosphates seemed to be an important P-fraction in meadows, but were only found in lower concentrations in the heath. There were only small differences in NaOH-extractable P between the vegetation types and this correlated with the distribution of oxalateextractable Al. Plant N:P ratios and the plant bioassay indicated decreasing P availability from dry heath to mesic heath to mesic meadow. The microbial bioassay suggests that the heterotrophic microbial community is C-limited with N as a secondary limiting nutrient although there were indications that microbial P availability was lower in the meadow sites. Overall, we suggest that the observed variations in soil P across vegetation types are affecting both plant and microbial function although the differences seem to be relatively small.
20456433|A statistically significant linear relationship was found between annual mass loss of foliar litter in the late stages of decomposition and Mn concentration in the litter. We used existing decomposition data on needle and leaf decomposition of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. contorta), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Kars.), silver birch (Betula pendula L.), and grey alder (Alnus incana L.) from Sweden and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) from Libya, to represent boreal, temperate, and Mediterranean climates. The later the decomposition stage as indicated by higher sulfuric-acid lignin concentrations, the better were the linear relationships between litter mass loss and Mn concentrations. We conclude that Mn concentrations in litter have an influence on litter mass-loss rates in very late decomposition stages (up to 5 years), provided that the litter has high enough Mn concentration. The relationship may be dependent on species as the relationship is stronger with species that take up high enough amounts of Mn.
41410594|It is well known that inherent characteristics of forest species constitute the main control of litter decomposition. In mixed forest, chemical interactions occurring through precipitation turn mechanisms of litter decomposition very uncertain and difficult to predict. Early-stage leaf litter decomposition of Quercus potosina and Pinus cembroides and their controls were examined based on Ostrofsky's decomposition mechanisms. From June 2007 to May 2008, litterbags with pure and mixed leaf-litter of Q. potosina and P. cembroides were incubated in situ in monospecific and mixed tree stands, respectively. Sampling was carried out 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after incubation. After 12 months, two phases of decomposition of pure and mixed litter were identified; an early phase with a greater rate of mass loss of the labile litter fraction (k L ; soluble compounds) and a later phase with a lower rate of mass loss of the recalcitrant litter fraction (k R ; lignin). The labile fraction lost was observed at three and 6 months of incubation, which coincided with the months of highest rainfall likely triggering a rapid release of soluble carbon compounds from leaf litter. Results also indicate that leaf-litter from Q. potosina had higher concentration of soluble compounds and lower lignin concentration than leaf litter from P. cembroides. Observed facilitative and inhibitory mechanisms for mass loss in Q. potosina and P. cembroides were controlled by interaction between physico-chemical litter characteristics and rainfall.
1469212|Experimental acidification of a softwater lake to below pH 5 fundamentally changed the sulfur cycle and lowered internal alkalinity generation (IAG). Prior to reaching pH 4.5, the balance of sulfur reduction and oxidation reactions within the lake was in favour of reduction, and the lake was a net sink for sulfate. In the four years at pH 4.5 the balance of reduction and oxidation reactions was in favour of oxidation, and there was a net production of sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) within the lake. Evidence indicating a decrease in net SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction at pH 4.5 was also obtained in an anthropogenically acidified lake that had been acidified for many decades. In both lakes, the decrease in net SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction appeared to be linked not to a simple inhibition of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction but rather to changes in benthic ecosystem structure, especially the development of metaphytic filamentous green algae, which altered the balance between SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction and sulfur oxidation. At pH's above 4.5, net SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction was the major contributor to IAG in the experimental lake, as it is in many previously studied lakes at pH 5 and above. At pH 4.5, the change in net annual SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction (a decrease of 110%) resulted in a 38% decrease in total IAG. Because of the important role of net SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction in acid neutralization in softwater lakes, models for predicting acidification and recovery of lakes may need to be modified for lakes acidified to pH < 5.
20055271|This study, based on field and laboratory work, investigates the biogeochemical activity below the organic top soil horizons, particularly the potential for nitrate removal processes in the deep vadose zone (1-2.5 m depth) of a weathered granite. An experimental site located in the Kerbernez agricultural catchment (Brittany) has been equipped with ceramic cups from 0.5 to 2.5 m depth since November 2001. This arrangement allowed collection of water samples from the soil profile and the upper part of the unsaturated weathered granite. Samples were analysed twice a month for chloride, nitrate and sulphate concentrations over a period of 2.5 years. Laboratory measurements were carried out on three soil horizons and four weathered granite facies sampled in October 2003 for hydrolasic activity, potential nitrification, potential denitrification and batch experiments to study nutrient dynamics. Anion analyses in the field show that the nitrate and chloride concentrations were linearly correlated at each depth. The nitrate/chloride ratio decreased with depth in the upper part of the weathered granite from 4.93 to 2.82. This suggests that nitrate was removed during its vertical transport in the unsaturated zone. The laboratory experiments show that the bacterial activity decreased with depth. However, a significant potential for biogeochemical reactions exists below the organic soil layers. The denitrification rates obtained in the laboratory were significant, up to 800 ng N
1468732| A great number of important chemical reactions that occur in the environment are microbially mediated. In order to understand the kinetics of these reactions it is necessary to develop methods to directly measure in situ reaction rates and to develop models to help elucidate the mechanisms of microbial catalysis. The oxidation of Mn(II) in a zone above the O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>S interface in Saanich Inlet, B.C., Canada is one such reaction. We present here a method by which in situ rates of microbial Mn(II) oxidation are measured and a model based on our experimental results to describe the general mechanism of Mn(II) oxidation. We propose a two step process in which Mn(II) is first bound by a site on the bacterial surface and then oxidized. The model is analogous to the Langmuir isotherm model for surface catalyzed gas reactions or the Michaelis-Menten model for enzyme kinetics. In situ Mn(II) oxidation rates were measured during five cruises to Saanich Inlet during the summers of 1983 and 1984. We use the model to calculate the apparent equilibrium binding constant (K<sub>s</sub>  0.18 M), the apparent half saturation constant for biological Mn(II) oxidation (K<sub>m</sub> = 0.22 to 0.89 M), the maximum rate of Mn(II) oxidation (V<sub>max</sub> = 3.5 to 12.1 nM h<sup>-1</sup>) and the total microbial surface binding site concentration (E  51 nM). V<sub>max</sub> for Mn(II) oxidation agrees with the rates calculated from the value of the flux of Mn(II) to the oxidizing zone using the Mn(II) gradient and estimates of the eddy diffusion coefficient. This consistancy verifies our methodology and indicates that the rate of Mn(II) oxidation is nearly equal to the V<sub>max</sub> for the reaction. We conclude that in this environment the Mn(II) oxidation rate is more a function of the total number of surface binding sites than the Mn(II) concentration. 
1468847|Samples of bulk precipitation were collected in the Trachypogon savanna, Calabozo, Venezuela, during three consecutive years. In the first year, rain samples were taken daily; in the following years the samples were grouped on a monthly basis. In addition, samples of dry deposition were collected during the dry seasons. All samples were analyzed for the following water soluble cations and anions: PO<sub>4</sub>-P, SO<sub>4</sub>-S, NO<sub>3</sub>-N, NH<sub>4</sub>-N, Ca<sup>+2</sup>, Mg<sup>+2</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>. The mean annual input rate of chemical constituents (Kg ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>) was: PO<sub>4</sub>-P (0.42); SO<sub>4</sub>-S (2.62); NO<sub>3</sub>-N (0.21); NH<sub>4</sub>-N (2.03); Ca<sup>+2</sup> (3.50); Mg<sup>+2</sup> (11.31); K<sup>+</sup> (3.60); Na<sup>+</sup> (5.93) and H<sup>+</sup>(0.03). The total mean input of particulate material to the savanna during the dry season was 2.06 Kg ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>, with a soluble fraction of 30%. Possible sources of nutrients input were analyzed.
1469970| Iron plaque occurs on the roots of most wetland and submersed aquatic plant species and is a large pool of oxidized Fe(III) in some environments. Because plaque formation in wetlands with circumneutral pH has been largely assumed to be an abiotic process, no systematic effort has been made to describe plaque-associated microbial communities or their role in plaque deposition. We hypothesized that Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) are abundant in the rhizosphere of wetland plants across a wide range of biogeochemical environments. In a survey of 13 wetland and aquatic habitats in the Mid-Atlantic region, FeOB were present in the rhizosphere of 92% of the plant specimens collected (n = 37), representing 25 plant species. In a subsequent study at six of these sites, bacterial abundances were determined in the rhizosphere and bulk soil using the most probable number technique. The soil had significantly more total bacteria than the roots on a dry mass basis (1.4 10<sup>9</sup> cells/g soil vs. 8.6 10<sup>7</sup> cells/g root; p < 0.05). The absolute abundance of aerobic, lithotrophic FeOB was higher in the soil than in the rhizosphere (3.7 10<sup>6</sup> /g soil vs. 5.9 10<sup>5</sup> /g root; p < 0.05), but there was no statistical difference between these habitats in terms of relative abundance ( 1% of the total cell number). In the rhizosphere, FeRB accounted for an average of 12% of all bacterial cells while in the soil they accounted for < 1% of the total bacteria. We concluded that FeOB are ubiquitous and abundant in wetland ecosystems, and that FeRB are dominant members of the rhizosphere microbial community. These observations provide a strong rationale for quantifying the contribution of FeOB to rhizosphere Fe(II) oxidation rates, and investigating the combined role of FeOB and FeRB in a rhizosphere iron cycle. 
24716800|Extracellular phenol oxidases play an important role in the soil carbon cycle. How phenol oxidase activity in peatlands will respond to increased aeration induced by water-table drawdown or droughts if global warming continues remains unclear. We investigated the short-term effects of drought induced acidification on phenol oxidase activities of a Sphagnum-dominated peatland in central China. The results indicated a significant acidification induced by drought, with a decline in the average pH value from 5.67  0.08 under waterlogging to 4.84  0.08 in droughted peat. In addition, drought-treated peat had a lower average value of phenol oxidase activities compared to the waterlogging-treated peat (mean values of 0.1404  0.0305 and 0.2623  0.0324 mol diqc min g, respectively). The decreased phenol oxidase activities were mainly attributed to the acidification induced by drought. However, the declines in phenol oxidase activity did not lead to the reduction of the degradation in the deeper peat. Under drought conditions, a considerable part of the adsorbed phenolics, consisting primarily of high molecular-weight organic substances with phenolic groups, were further degraded into smaller-sized or lower molecular weight hydrophilic fractions in the vicinity of the water table. Our results highlight the important role of the water table position in peat decomposition processes. Even with lower activities of phenol oxidase, the decomposition processes were able to effectively keep on going as long as there was sufficient supply of water, oxygen and nutrients.
40647948|Accurate quantification of different soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions is needed to understand their relative importance in the global C cycle. Among the chemical methods of SOC fractionation, oxidative degradation is considered more promising because of its ability to mimic the natural microbial oxidative processes in soil. This study focuses on detailed understanding of changes in structural chemistry and isotopic signatures of SOC upon different oxidative treatments for assessing the ability of these chemicals to selectively isolate a refractory fraction of SOC. Replicated sampling (to ~ 1 m depth) of pedons classified as Typic Fragiudalf was conducted under four land uses (woodlot, grassland, no-till and conventional-till continuous corn [Zea mays L.]) at Wooster, OH. Soil samples (< 2 mm) were treated with three oxidizing agents (hydrogen peroxide (HO), disodium peroxodisulfate (NaSO) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)). Oxidation resistant residues and the bulk soil from A1/Ap1 horizons of each land use were further analyzed by solid-state C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and accelerator mass spectrometry to determine structural chemistry and C activity, respectively. Results indicated that, oxidation with NaOCl removed significantly less SOC compared to NaSO and HO. The NMR spectra revealed that NaOCl oxidation preferentially removed lignin-derived compounds at 56 ppm and at 110-160 ppm. On the other hand, the SOC resistant to NaSO and HO oxidation were enriched with alkyl groups, which dominate in recalcitrant macromolecules. This finding was corroborated by the C activity of residual material, which ranged from -542 to -259 for NaSO resistant SOC and -475 to -182 o for HO resistant SOC as compared to relatively greater C activity of NaOCl resistant residues (47 to 61). Additionally, HO treatment on soils after light fraction removal was more effective in isolating the oldest (C activity of -725 to -469) SOC fraction. The C signature of SOC removed by different oxidizing agents, calculated by mass balance, was more or less similar irrespective of the difference in labile SOC removal efficiency. This suggests that SOC isolated by many fractionation methods is still a mixture of much younger and older material and therefore it is very important that the labile SOC should be completely removed before measuring the turnover time of stable and refractory pools of SOC.
25652633|Different phosphorus fractions and metal element composition of surficial sediments were measured on three occasions in 2005 and 2006 along a transect between Nyanza Gulf and offshore Lake Victoria, in order to assess the potential for sediments to contribute to the water column P concentrations in Lake Victoria. Total phosphorus (TP), apatite phosphorus (AP), inorganic phosphorus (IP) and organic phosphorus (OP) increased in sediments along the gulf towards the main lake while the non-apatite inorganic phosphorus (NAIP) increases were less defined. The longitudinal gradient of sediment TP and its fractions in Nyanza Gulf is a result of high rates of terrigenous input and resuspension and transport of the light, phosphorus rich inorganic and organic matter towards the main lake. TP in the sediment ranged from 812.7 to 1,738 mg/kg dry weight (DW) and was highest in the Rusinga Channel, the exchange zone between the gulf and the main lake. AP was the most important TP fraction, contributing between 35 and 57.3% of TP. Ca content in the sediment was strongly associated with TP and AP in the sediment (r = 0.92 and 0.98, respectively) in the gulf and the channel, indicating the importance of apatite in controlling P availability in these zones. In the gulf and the Rusinga Channel, the less bioavailable apatite phosphorus dominated, whereas in the deeper main lake OP was the major fraction illustrating the importance of anaerobic release of P from sediments and acceleration of internal P loading in the main lake.
1469598|Previous studies have shown that (a) a large portion of the annual total organic carbon (TOC) inputs to central Ontario lakes is either lost to sediments or degraded and lost via evasion to the atmosphere, (b) the partitioning of organic carbon between sediments and the atmosphere appears to be a function of acidity and (c) UV irradiation can account for observed long-term loss of TOC from the water column. These findings were extended by examining whether acidity enhances photo-oxidative losses of TOC. Stream waters (initial alkalinities between -97 and 233  eq l-1) were incubated in UV-transparent containers under incident solar radiation for periods ranging from 14 to 23 days. The highest photo-oxidation rates occurred when alkalinity was negative. Additions of acid and base to stream waters increased and decreased photo-oxidation rates, respectively. The exceptional clarity of atmospherically acidified lakes is usually attributed to increased precipitation of Al-organic carbon complexes but may instead be due to higher photo-oxidation rates of allocthonous organic carbon leading to higher evasion rates of CO2.
23359716|Both solar irradiance and primary production have been proposed as independent controls on seawater dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) concentrations. However, irradiance also drives photosynthesis, and thus influences a complex set of inter-related processes that modulate marine DMS. We investigate the potential inter-relationships between the rate of primary production (carbon assimilation), water-attenuated irradiance and DMS/DMSP dynamics by applying correlation analysis to a high resolution, concurrently sampled in situ data set from a range of latitudes covering multiple biogeochemical provinces from 3 of the 4 Longhurst biogeochemical domains. The combination of primary production (PP) and underwater irradiance (Iz) within a multivariate regression model is able to explain 55% of the variance in DMS concentrations from all depths within the euphotic zone and 66% of the variance in surface DMS concentrations. Contrary to some previous studies we find a variable representing biological processes is necessary to better account for the variance in DMS. We find that the inclusion of Iz accounts for variance in DMS that is independent from the variance explained by PP. This suggests an important role for solar irradiance (beyond the influence of irradiance upon primary production) in mediating the relationship between the productivity of the ecosystem, DMS/DMSP production and ambient seawater DMS concentrations.
1469757| Cyanobacterial mats (CBM) are important components of wetland ecosystems in limestone-based regions of the Caribbean. During two sampling periods (July 1999 and January 2000) we measured N<sub>2</sub>-fixation in samples from 23 different marshes simultaneously with measurements of relevant environmental factors. Samples were evaluated for abundance of five groups of cyanobacteria: (1) Leptolyngbya, (2) Oscillatoria, (3) Chroococcales, (4) Nostoc-& Stigonematales, and (5) dead sheaths. Differences in nitrogen fixation, expressed as nitrogenase activity in nmol C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, were best explained by the proportion of heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. The samples were analyzed for the natural abundance of  <sup>15</sup>N.  <sup>15</sup>N values ranged from -1.99 to 11.44 and were strongly negatively correlated with N<sub>2</sub>-fixation. With all data included,  <sup>15</sup>N was also strongly correlated with nitrates in water. With the samples from Little Belize (high nitrate content marshes) excluded, the effect of nitrate became insignificant. N<sub>2</sub>-fixation predicted from  <sup>15</sup>N measured on an independent data set from September 2000 was moderately accurate (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.68, 0.52 and 0.54 for predictions based on July 1999, January 2000 and combined data sets, respectively). When individual sample sets were divided into two groups with  <sup>15</sup>N < 2 and  <sup>15</sup>N > 2, the two groups were always highly significantly different in terms of their N<sub>2</sub>-fixation. The presented evidence suggests that  <sup>15</sup>N can be used as a reliable indicator of N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by CBM. 
1468513| Seasonal variation of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and methane thiol (MSH) concentrations in sediment porewater was determined in a Danish estuary. Dimethylsulfide (DMDS) was never found. Detectable DMS levels of up to 0.1 M were found only in the summer and only within the upper 5 cm of the sediment. The DMS accumulation was probably associated with decomposing fragments of macro-algae in the surface layer. Significant MSH accumulation of up to 1 M was found only in the deep, CH<sub>4</sub>-rich sediment below the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> zone. With depth, a detectable MSH level could thus be observed below the 1 mM SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-isopleth which also marked the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-CH<sub>4</sub> transition. The transition zone was located deeper in the sediment in winter (20-25 cm depth) than in summer (5-10 cm depth). The absence of MSH in the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> zone could be due to rapid utilization of the compound by SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-reducing bacteria. A possible involvement of MSH in anaerobic CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation at the transition zone is discussed; CH<sub>4</sub> and sulfide (HS<sup>-</sup> form, pH 7) are proposed to form MSH and H<sub>2</sub> which in turn may be metabolized by, e.g. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-reducing bacteria. 
40343753|Sequential density fractionation separated soil particles into "light" predominantly mineral-free organic matter vs. increasingly "heavy" organo-mineral particles in four soils of widely differing mineralogy. With increasing particle density C concentration decreased, implying that the soil organic matter (OM) accumulations were thinner. With thinner accumulations we saw evidence for both an increase in C-based mean residence time (MRT) of the OM and a shift from plant to microbial origin. Evidence for the latter included: (1) a decrease in C/N, (2) a decrease in lignin phenols and an increase in their oxidation state, and (3) an increase in C and N. Although bulk-soil OM levels varied substantially across the four soils, trends in OM composition and MRT across the density fractions were similar. In the intermediate density fractions (~1.8-2.6 g cm), most of the reactive sites available for interaction with organic molecules were provided by aluminosilicate clays, and OM characteristics were consistent with a layered mode of OM accumulation. With increasing density (lower OM loading) within this range, OM showed evidence of an increasingly microbial origin. We hypothesize that this microbially derived OM was young at the time of attachment to the mineral surfaces but that it persisted due to both binding with mineral surfaces and protection beneath layers of younger, less microbially processed C. As a result of these processes, the OM increased in MRT, oxidation state, and degree of microbial processing in the sequentially denser intermediate fractions. Thus mineral surface chemistry is assumed to play little role in determining OM composition in these intermediate fractions. As the separation density was increased beyond ~ 2.6 g cm, mineralogy shifted markedly: aluminosilicate clays gave way first to light primary minerals including quartz, then at even higher densities to various Fe-bearing primary minerals. Correspondingly, we observed a marked drop in N, a weaker decrease in extent of microbial processing of lignin phenols, and some evidence of a rise in C/N ratio. At the same time, however, C-based MRT time continued its increase. The increase in MRT, despite decreases in degree of microbial alteration, suggests that mineral surface composition (especially Fe concentration) plays a strong role in determining OM composition across these two densest fractions.
40343742|The chemical composition and vertical distribution of phosphorus (P) in poorly oxygenated sediments in a continuum extending from the open Baltic Sea towards an organic-rich inner bay were characterized by sequential extraction to examine the potential for release of sediment P. The chemical composition of  was related to chemical and physical characteristics of the sediments and the chemistry of pore water and near-bottom water to better understand the behaviour of P. Sediment  increased towards the inner bay, and the concentration of organic matter appeared to dictate its composition: the dominance of apatite-P turned to dominance of organic  (OP). Sediment  burial and, thus, release from sediment  reserves varied depending on the chemical composition of P. Dissolved species at the sediment-water interface suggested fluctuating redox conditions that affect  binding at short time scale. Redox-sensitive, iron (Fe)-bound  was usually relatively low because of poor oxygen (O) conditions, which emphasized the role of OP in P release. The results indicate that, over the long term, the abundant organic P reserve may support a significant continuing P release from hypoxic sediments in the severely eutrophied Gulf of Finland (GoF) because capture of P into Fe oxyhydroxides at the sediment surface is restricted. The average long-term minimum annual rate of P release from poorly oxygenated sediments below about 60 m depth in the GoF was approximated on the basis of the vertical distribution of sedimentary P forms and estimates of sedimentation rate.
24715332|In 1959, Athol Rafter began a substantial programme of monitoring the flow of C produced by atmospheric thermonuclear tests through New Zealand's atmosphere, biosphere and soil. By building on the original measurements through ongoing sampling, a database of over 500 soil radiocarbon measurements spanning 50 years has now been compiled. The datasets, including an 11-point time series, allow strong focus on the robust quantification of residence times ranging from years to decades. We describe key aspects of the dataset, including the ability to identify critical assumptions inherent in calculating soil C residence times. The 3 most critical assumptions relate to: (1) the proportion of old C ("fraction passive"), (2) the lag time between photosynthesis and C entering the modeled pool, and (3) changes in the rates of C input (i.e., steady state). We demonstrate the ability to compare residence times in contrasting sites, such Andisols and non-Andisols, and the ability to calculate residence times across a range of soil depths. We use C in a two-box model to quantify soil carbon turnover parameters in deforested dairy pastures under similar climate in the Tokomaru silt loam (non-Andisol) versus the Egmont black loam (Andisol), originally sampled in 1962, 1965 and 1969, and resampled again in 2008. The C-based residence times of the main soil C pool in surface soil ( 8 cm) are 9 years in the Tokomaru soils compared to 17 years for the Egmont soils. This difference represents nearly a doubling of soil C residence time, and roughly explains the doubling of the soil C stock. Passive soil C comprises 15% of the soil C pool in Tokomaru soils versus 27% in Egmont soils. A similar difference in residence times is found in a second surface soil comparison between the Bruntwood soil (Andisol) and the Te Kowhai soil (non-Andisol) with residence times of 18 and 27 years, respectively. The comparisons support evidence that C dynamics do differ in Andisols versus non-Andisols, as a result of both the mineral allophane and Al complexation. Expanding our calculations beyond surface soil, we show that thickening the calculation depth by combining horizons allows robust residence times to be calculated at a range of depths. Overall, the large and systematically collected dataset demonstrate that soil C residence times of the main soil C pool can be routinely calculated using C wherever samples collected 10 or more years apart in New Zealand grassland soils are available, and presumably under similar circumstances in other soils worldwide.
23359706|The influence of solar ultraviolet radiation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on summertime marine bacterial uptake and assimilation of sulfur from radiolabeled dimethlysulfoniopropionate ( 35 S-DMSP) was studied at four Arctic and two Antarctic stations. Incubations with 3 H-leucine were also conducted for comparative purposes as a measurement of bacterial activity. Arctic waters were characterized by large numbers of colonial Phaeocystis pouchetii and higher DMSP concentrations than in the two diatom-dominated Antarctic samples. Exposure to full sunlight radiation (280700 nm), and to a lesser extent to PAR + UVA (320700 nm), generally decreased the bacterial assimilation of 3 H-leucine with respect to darkness, and caused variable effects on 35 S-DMSP assimilation. By using a single-cell approach involving microautoradiography we found high percentages of sulfur assimilating cells within the bacterial groups Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, SAR11 and Roseobacter despite the varying DMSP concentrations between Arctic and Antarctic samples. The dominant SAR11 clade contributed 5070% of the cells assimilating both substrates in the Arctic stations, whereas either Gammaproteobacteria or SAR11 were the largest contributors to 3 H-leucine uptake in samples from the two Antarctic stations. Only one station was analyzed for single-cell 35 S-DMSP assimilation in Antarctica, and Gammaproteobacteria were major contributors to its uptake, providing the first evidence for Antarctic bacteria actively taking up 35 S-DMSP. PAR + UVA repeatedly increased the number of SAR11 cells assimilating 3 H-leucine. This pattern also occurred with other 35 S-DMSP assimilating groups, though not so consistently. Our results support a widespread capability of polar bacteria to assimilate DMSP-sulfur during the season of maximum DMSP concentrations, and show for the first time that all major polar taxa can be highly active at this assimilation under the appropriate circumstances. Our findings further confirm the role of sunlight as a modulator of heterotrophic carbon and sulfur fluxes in the surface ocean.
1469730|Methane oxidation in the water column was investigated at two nearshore marine environments with relatively high concentrations of dissolved methane. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, high methane oxidation rates were observed at the pycnocline, with the highest oxidation rate corresponding to the most negative bacterial  <sup>13</sup>C values. These low isotopic values occurred during the winter when overall bacterial productivity was low, suggesting that at this time of the year, methanotrophs in the Gulf could make up a significant portion of the overall bacterial assemblage. Although methane oxidation also occurred during more productive times (i.e., summer), the isotopic signal of methane oxidation was not observed in the bacterial biomass because of the higher overall bacterial productivity. The other site, Cape Lookout Bight, NC, is a small marine embayment where methane is produced in the organic-rich sediments. No measurable rates of methane oxidation in the water column occurred, and no anomalously low  <sup>13</sup>C values of the bacterioplankton were measured. In both environments, methane production and oxidation appear to be spatially coupled, occurring at/near the pycnocline in the northern Gulf of Mexico and at the sediment-water interface at Cape Lookout Bight, NC.
20519898|Whole air drawn from four heights within the high elevation (3,340 m asl), deep, winter snowpack at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, were sampled into stainless steel canisters, and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography for 51 volatile inorganic and organic gases. Two adjacent plots with similar snow cover were sampled, one over bare soil and a second one from within a snow-filled chamber where Tedlar/Teflon-film covered the ground and isolated it from the soil. This comparison allowed for studying effects from processes in the snowpack itself versus soil influences on the gas concentrations and fluxes within and through the snowpack. Samples were also collected from ambient air above the snow surface for comparison with the snowpack air. Analyzed gas species were found to exhibit three different kinds of behavior: (1) One group of gases, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO), chloroform (CHCl), dimethylsulfide (CH)S, carbondisulfide (CS), and dichlorobromomethane (CHBrCl), displayed higher concentrations inside the snow, indicating a formation of these species and release into the atmosphere. (2) A second group of compounds, including carbon monoxide (CO), carbonyl sulfide (COS), the hydrocarbons methane, ethane, ethyne, benzene, and the halogenated compounds methylchloride (CHCl), methylbromide (CHBr), dibromomethane (CHBr), bromoform (CHBr), tetrachloromethane (CCl), CFC-11, CFC-12, HCFC-22, CFC-113, 1,2-dichloroethane, methylchloroform, HCFC-141b, and HCFC-142b, were found at lower concentrations in the snow, indicating that the snow and/or soil constitute a sink for these gases. (3) For 21 other gases absolute concentrations, respectively concentration gradients, were too low to unequivocally identify their uptake or release behavior. For gases listed in the first two groups, concentration gradients were incorporated into a snowpack gas diffusion model to derive preliminary estimates of fluxes at the snow-atmosphere interface. The snowpack gradient flux technique was found to offer a highly sensitive method for the study of these surface gas exchanges. Microbial activities below this deep, winter snowpack appear to be the driving mechanism behind these gas sources and sinks. Flux results were applied to a simple box model to assess the potential contribution of the snowpack uptake rates to atmospheric lifetimes of these species.
1469529|A simple, catchment-scale, cascade model was used to assess the importance of sinks and sources of methylmercury (MeHg) in a boreal catchment that contains a forested upland, a lowland peatland and a small lake. The three compartment model was run using realistic flow rates and atmospheric loading of MeHg, and the model was constrained by observed concentrations of MeHg in each compartment. Assuming no internal sinks and sources of MeHg, modelled catchment yields showed reasonable agreement with field observation, but the predicted internal MeHg concentrations in each compartment were implausible. Only when sources and sinks of MeHg are added to the three compartments do MeHg-pool concentrations fall into the range of those measured in the field. To maintain both catchment-scale and compartment-scale continuity, the upland and peatland were net sources of MeHg (0.0007 and 0.1065 mg ha<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> respectively), and the lake a net sink (-0.2215 mg ha<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). These source/sink rates are 1.73, 259 and -539 times the input of MeHg via wet precipitation input for the modelled ice-free season. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the volume of runoff delivered to the peatland by the upland area, peatland size and porewater MeHg concentration in the peatland are important controls on catchment MeHg yield, and that contemporary atmospheric deposition of MeHg is insignificant compared to the sources of MeHg within the catchment.
40647930|This paper presents a general discussion of the interplay between model structure and hydrologic parameters in the context of denitrification estimation using coupled hydro-ecosystem models at a watershed scale. Given the key role played by hydrology in denitrification models, sensitivity analysis of hydrologie parameters is needed to determine both uncertainty in denitrification estimates and to suggest how measured data, such as streamflow, can be effectively used to reduce this uncertainty. This paper contributes to the broad goal of sensitivity analysis by examining the linkage between landscape tessellation, calibration, and the ability of models to capture hot-spot contributions to watershed scale denitrification across a range of N-loading. For a small mid-Atlantic forested watershed, denitrification estimates using RHESSys (regional hydro-ecologic simulation system) are compared across different strategies for calibration and landscape tessellation. Results demonstrate the utility of several potential approaches to account for hydrologically mediated hot-spots within landscapes.
20519891|Considerable research has recently been devoted to understanding biogeochemical processes under winter snow cover, leading to enhanced appreciation of the importance of many winter ecological processes. In this study, a comprehensive investigation of the stable carbon isotope composition (C) of CO within a high-elevation subalpine forest snowpack was conducted. Our goals were to study the C of biological soil respiration under snow in winter, and to assess the relative importance of diffusion and advection (ventilation by wind) for gas transport within snow. In agreement with other studies, we found evidence of an active microbial community under a roughly 1-m deep snowpack during winter and into spring as it melted. Undersnow CO mole fractions were observed up to 3,500 mol mol, and C of CO varied from -22 to -8. The C of soil respiration calculated from mixing relationships was -26 to -24, and although it varied in time, it was generally close to that of the bulk organic horizon (-26.0). Subnivean CO and C were quite dynamic in response to changes in soil temperature, liquid water availability, and wind events. No clear biologically-induced isotopic changes were observed during periods when microbial activity and root/rhizosphere activity were expected to vary, although such changes cannot be eliminated. There was clear evidence of isotopic enrichment associated with diffusive transport as predicted by theory, but simple diffusive enrichment (4.4) was not observed. Instead, ventilation of the snowpack by sustained wind events in the forest canopy led to changes in the diffusively-enriched gas profile. The isotopic influence of diffusion on gases in the snowpack and litter was greatest at greater depths, due to the decreased relative contribution of advection at depth. There were highly significant correlations between the apparent isotopic content of respiration from the soil with wind speed and pressure. In summary, physical factors influencing gas transport substantially modified and potentially obscured biological factors in their effects on C of CO within this subalpine forest snowpack.
4151505| The paper presents an endoscope technique to provide a non-destructive detection and imaging of biofilms on porous sand grains without disturbing the system. This in situ observation of biofilm growth was carried out by inserting an endoscope into the reactor after introducing the substrate into a water-saturated quartz sand-packed reactor. As the microbes grew on the media surface with time, an expansion was presented in biofilm area. In this way, the growth of biofilm on porous sand grains could be continuously captured. The expanding of the biofilm image was observed, and the biofilm on the sand grains was measured by image analysis of biofilm crosssections. In order to further identify the biofilm growth, at the end of experiment the packed reactor was dismantled and biofilms along with the aquifer material were sampled for the biofilm growth observation by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The biofilm thickness was also measured by image analysis of biofilm cross-sections. The results demonstrated significant spatial variations in mean biofilm thickness (106.2  12.54 pm to 243.5  26.53 pm) and thickness variability (0.07-0.12) using image analysis of SEM. However, the mean biofilm thickness measurements done by image analysis of SEM were about 60-82% smaller compared with those by image analysis of endoscopy. This is because of the dehydration and alteration of the biofilm material after dismantling the reactor for SEM observations. In comparison, we found that the endoscope image could provide a first-hand observation of biofilm growth without disrupting the system, while the SEM image could give a better resolution. 
20456565|The Sava River and its tributaries in Slovenia represent waters strongly influenced by chemical weathering of limestone and dolomite. The carbon isotopic compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and suspended organic carbon (POC) fractions as well as major solute concentrations yielded insights into the origin and fluxes of carbon in the upper Sava River system. The major solute composition was dominated by carbonic acid dissolution of calcite and dolomite. Waters were generally supersaturated with respect to calcite, and dissolved CO was about fivefold supersaturated relative to the atmosphere. The C of DIC ranged from -13.5 to -3.3. Mass balances for riverine inorganic carbon suggest that carbonate dissolution contributes up to 26%, degradation of organic matter 17% and exchange with atmospheric CO up to 5%. The concentration and stable isotope diffusion models indicated that atmospheric exchange of CO predominates in streams draining impermeable shales and clays while in the carbonate-dominated watersheds dissolution of the Mesozoic carbonates predominates.
20456537|Sulfate reduction rates and biogeochemical parameters of fish farm sediments across the Mediterranean were investigated in the order to evaluate the potential effects of organic matter inputs on habitat quality for the common seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Four study sites were selected in Spain, Italy, Greece and Cyprus to represent the Mediterranean basin. P. oceanica was found in immediate vicinity of all the farms, which were located at physically exposed sites about 1 km from the shore lines. Organic matter accumulation, sulfate reduction rates and sulfur pools were measured in depth profiles along transects from the farms in both bare and vegetated sediments. Results show that although the organic matter accumulation was minor at the sites (POC &lt; 2.8% DW), the sulfate reduction rates were high in particular at the largest farm in Italy (up to 212 mmol m d), similar to rates found at shallower, temperate fish farm sites, where higher sedimentation rates can be expected. Sulfate reducing bacteria in these low-organic, carbonate-rich Mediterranean sediments respond strongly to organic matter loadings and cause habitat degradation. Sulfate reduction rates measured in the P. oceanica sediments were among the highest recorded (7.8-42.0 mmol m d) similar to rates found in degrading meadows impacted by organic matter loadings. As sulfate reduction rates were correlated with the sedimentation rates along the transects rather than organic matter pools this suggests mineralization processes were controlled by organic matter loading in fish farm sediments. The vegetated sediments near the net cages were more reduced due to accumulation of sulfides compared to control sites, which is a possible contributing factor to the observed seagrass decline in the farm surroundings. It is recommended that Mediterranean fish farms are placed in areas with rapid dispersal of particulate waste products to minimize organic matter loading of the sediments and thereby preserve habitat quality for benthic fauna and flora.
4151477|Lead compounds, especially ionic organolead compounds (OLC), are highly toxic and mobile pollutants strongly affecting many ecosystems. Soil pools and fluxes with precipitation, litterfall and runoff of trimethyllead (TML), one of the dominant ionic OLC in the environment, and Pbtotai were investigated in a forested ecosystem in NE-Bavaria, Germany. In addition, ad/desorption of TML to soils was studied in batch experiments and its degradation in soils was investigated using long term incubations. Total soil storage in the catchment was 11.56 mg Pb ha
1468897| The mineralization of organic carbon to CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub></sub> in Sphagnum-derived peat from Big Run Bog, West Virginia, was measured at 4 times in the year (February, May, September, and November) using anaerobic, peat-slurry incubations. Rates of both CH<sub>4</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> production changed seasonally in surface peat (0-25 cm depth), but were the same on each collection date in deep peat (30-45 cm depth). Methane production in surface peat ranged from 0.2 to 18.8  mol mol(C)<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> (or 0.07 to 10.4  g(CH<sub>4</sub>) g<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>) between the February and September collections, respectively, and was approximately 1  mol mol(C)<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> in deep peat. Carbon dioxide production in surface peat ranged from 3.2 to 20  mol mol(C)<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> (or 4.8 to 30.3  g(CO<sub>2</sub>) g<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>) between the February and September collections, respectively, and was about 4  mol mol(C)<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup> in deep peat. In surface peat, temperature the master variable controlling the seasonal pattern in CO<sub>2</sub> production, but the rate of CH<sub>4</sub> production still had the lowest values in the February collection even when the peat was incubated at 19 C. The addition of glucose, acetate, and H<sub>2</sub> to the peat-slurry did not stimulate CH<sub>4</sub> production in surface peat, indicating that CH<sub>4</sub> production in the winter was limited by factors other than glucose degradation products. The low rate of carbon mineralization in deep peat was due, in part, to poor chemical quality of the peat, because adding glucose and hydrogen directly stimulated CH<sub>4</sub> production, and CO<sub>2</sub> production to a lesser extent. Acetate was utilized in the peat by methanogens, but became a toxin at low pH values. The addition of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> to the peat-slurry inhibited CH<sub>4</sub> production in surface peat, as expected, but surprisingly increased carbon mineralization through CH<sub>4</sub> production in deep peat. Carbon mineralization under anaerobic conditions is of sufficient magnitude to have a major influence on peat accumulation and helps to explain the thin (< 2 m deep), old (> 13,000 yr) peat deposit found in Big Run Bog. 
1469249| Methanogenesis was measured during the summer of 1994, in sediment cores and bulk samples from a Phragmites australis wetland in northern Jutland, Denmark. We compared sediment from healthy reed and dying-back reed, and an open lagoon resulting from die-back. Cores revealed variability with depth and between sites, with the highest rates coinciding with layers of organic gyttja, and negligible methane production from the underlying sand base. Methanogenesis rates in the lagoon and die back sites were higher (up to 100-150 nmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> dry wt. sediment) than in the healthy reed (50-80 nmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), with the highest rates being recorded from May to July. At these times, methanogenesis was markedly temperature-limited; samples incubated at 30 C a non-limiting temperature, gave rates as high as 200-400 nmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> for the lagoon and die-back areas and 150 nmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> for the healthy area. Addition of 8 mM acetate and H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> headspace suggested that both acetate-fermenting and CO<sub>2</sub>-reducing bacteria were present. Acetate additions suggested some co-limitation by substrate availability, with acetate limitation occurring in the healthy site during July and in the die-back site during August. Lower rates during August, especially in the healthy area, were associated with low water levels which resulted in more oxidized sediments. The data reveal highly variable methanogenesis in the sediment which, when considered with sediment depths, indicates that sites of Phragmites die-back have significantly greater rates of anaerobic mineralization than surrounding healthy wetland, and may be intense sources of methane. 
1468567|Hydrogen ion concentration, [H<sup>+</sup>], of discharge water from Pardee reservoir in the central Sierra Nevada, California was greater than expected in years of El Nino occurrence over the period 1954-86. This pattern is in addition to the general increase in [H<sup>+</sup>] over the same period attributed to acidic atmospheric deposition. Monthly means of [H<sup>+</sup>] also show differences between El Nino and non-El Nino years. Total annual runoff does not seem to be a controlling factor; the source and timing of storms are probably more important. Storms are usually from the west or northwest, but during El Nino years tropical-like storms from a more-southerly direction appear to carry acidic pollutants to the central Sierra Nevada.
20519855|This study deals with the chemical characterization of the biogeochemical processes occurring in a shallow aquifer in crystalline rocks. The influence of rock heterogeneity and the related physical processes on the aquifer biogeochemistry have been investigated. A hydrochemical survey (major anion and cation analysis) shows that rock heterogeneity leads to a stronger spatial than temporal variability. Some rapidly recharged and low-mineralized waters are present at the soil/rock interface. However the pumped well intersects a preferential flow path and pumps nitrate-rich water. Sulfur and oxygen isotope data from sulfates in the pumped water clearly show sulfide oxidation with only 20-30% of the oxygen atoms in sulfates formed by sulfide oxidation coming from atmospheric oxygen. This low contribution of molecular oxygen in sulfide oxidation, associated with the drastic decrease in nitrate concentration, involves a marked relationship between the nitrogen and sulfur cycles through denitrification, coupled with sulfide oxidation. Conversely, for rapidly recharged waters, the rock physical heterogeneity allows sulfide oxidation by molecular oxygen indicated by a contribution of atmospheric oxygen of nearly 70% in the newly formed sulfate. As the aquifer biogeochemistry is controlled by the physical characteristics of the rocks, pumping may overcome the natural flux pattern described previously. This anthropogenic disturbance leads to a modification of water pathways (spatial mixing or relative contribution of the fracture/matrix waters to the global fluxes) and, consequently, to a modification of the physical and biogeochemical processes occurring in the aquifer.
24715333|Incubation of C-labeled substrates continues to be a widely used procedure in soil organic matter (OM) research due to its sensitiveness. When the labeling is found in liquid fractions (soil extracts, hydrolysates), C can be easily quantified by using an aliquot for scintillation counting. For this reason, converting a solid carbon sample into liquid form is a typical step for accurate C analysis. We have developed an alternative method to carry out this step, which uses standard glass hardware and does not require complex laboratory facilities. Carbon (both in organic or inorganic forms) is converted into CO within a reaction vessel connected to a Twisselmann's extractor with an alkali trap inside. This forms an individual closed chamber (ICC) for each sample, thus eliminating the risk of cross-contaminations. The alkali solution adsorbs the evolved CO within the closed system, and the excess of pressure is easily overcome by the use of a balloon. We tested the procedure on a set of substrates and two contrasting soils, checking also the effect of different sample loads (from 20 to 160 mg C) on the CO recovery of the process. The percentage of carbon recovered into the alkali (i.e. the efficiency of the process) ranged from 92% for the inorganic C to 9395% for the organic C method, the latter being sensitive to the amount of sample used for analysis. The ICC method can be successfully applied to analyze C-labeling in both carbonates and OM from solid samples, thus representing an alternative method to some established protocols, and it is suitable for substrates with low or very low C contents, in which high volumes of sample must be analyzed in order to guarantee representative results.
1469442| The study was conducted in five contiguous small watersheds (12-28 ha) gauged for long-term ecosystem research. Five 80  30 m plots were used for the study. We quantified inputs from the atmosphere, dissolved and particulate-bound losses, throughfall and litterfall fluxes, standing crop litter and soil available P pools. Mean P input and output for a six-year period was 0.16 and 0.06 kgha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Phosphorus concentration increased as rainfall moved through the canopy. Annual P returns in litterfall (3.88 kg/ha) represented more than 90% of the total aboveground nutrient return to the forest floor. Phosphorus concentration in standing litter (0.08%) was lower than that in litterfall (0.11%). Phosphorus content in the litterfall was higher at Chamela than at other tropical dry forests. Mean residence time on the forest floor was 1.2 yr for P and 1.3 yr for organic matter. Together these results suggest that the forest at Chamela may not be limited by P availability and suggest a balance between P immobilization and uptake. Comparison of P losses in stream water with input rates from the atmosphere for the six-year period showed that inputs were higher than outputs. Balances calculated for a wet and a dry year indicated a small P accumulation in both years. 
1469324|To understand the accumulation of inorganic mercury and methylmercury at the base of the estuarine food chain, phytoplankton (Thalassiosira weissflogii) uptake and mercury speciation experiments were conducted. Complexation of methylmercury as methylmercury-bisulfide decreased the phytoplankton uptake rate while the uptake rate of the methylmercury-cysteine and -thiourea complexes increased with increasing complexation by these ligands. Furthermore, our results indicated that while different ligands influenced inorganic mercury/methylmercury uptake by phytoplankton cells, the ligand complex had no major influence on either where the mercury was sequestered within the phytoplankton cell nor the assimilation efficiency of the mercury by copepods. The assimilation efficiency of inorganic mercury/methylmercury by copepods and amphipods feeding on algal cells was compared and both organisms assimilated methylmercury much more efficiently; the relative assimilation efficiency of methylmercury to inorganic mercury was 2.0 for copepods and 2.8 for amphipods. The relative assimilation is somewhat concentration dependent as experiments showed that as exposure concentration increased, a greater percentage of methylmercury was found in the cytoplasm of phytoplankton cells, resulting in a higher concentration in the copepods feeding on these cells. Additionally, food quality influenced assimilation by invertebrates. During decay of a T. weissflogii culture, which served as food for the invertebrates, copepods were increasingly less able to assimilate the methylmercury from the food, while even at advanced stages of decay, amphipods were able to assimilate mercury from their food to a high degree. Finally, fish feeding on copepods assimilated methylmercury more efficiently than inorganic mercury owing to the larger fraction of methylmercury found in the soft tissues of the copepods.
40800608|There is still much uncertainty as to how wildfire affects the accumulation of burn residues (such as black carbon (BC)) in the soil, and the corresponding changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) composition in boreal forests. We investigated SOC and BC composition in black spruce forests on different landscape positions in Alaska, USA. Mean BC stocks in surface mineral soils (0.34  0.09 kg C m) were higher than in organic soils (0.17  0.07 kg C m), as determined at four sites by three different C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy-based techniques. Aromatic carbon, protein, BC, and the alkyl:O-alkyl carbon ratio were higher in mineral soil than in organic soil horizons. There was no trend between mineral soil BC stocks and fire frequencies estimated from lake sediment records at four sites, and soil BC was relatively modern (< 54400 years, based on mean C ranging from 95.1 to 54.7). A more extensive analysis (90 soil profiles) of mineral soil BC revealed that interactions among landscape position, organic layer depth, and bulk density explained most of the variance in soil BC across sites, with less soil BC occurring in relatively cold forests with deeper organic layers. We suggest that shallower organic layer depths and higher bulk densities found in warmer boreal forests are more favorable for BC production in wildfire, and more BC is integrated with mineral soil than organic horizons. Soil BC content likely reflected more recent burning conditions influenced by topography, and implications of this for SOC composition (e.g., aromaticity and protein content) are discussed.
41410571|The magnitude of greenhouse gas (GHG) flux rates may be important in wet and intermediate wet forest soils, but published estimates are scarce. We studied the surface exchange of methane (CH) and nitrous oxide (NO) from soil along toposequences in two temperate deciduous forest catchments: Strdam and Vestskoven. The soil water regime ranged from fully saturated to aerated within the catchments. At Strdam the largest mean flux rates of NO (15 g NO-N m h) were measured at volumetric soil water contents (SWC) between 40 and 60% and associated with low soil pH compared to smaller mean flux rates of 0-5 g NO-N m h for drier (SWC < 40%) and wet conditions (SWC > 80%). At Vestskoven the same response of NO to soil water content was observed. Average CH flux rates were highly variable along the toposequences ( 17 to 536 g CH-C m h) but emissions were only observed above soil water content of 45%. Scaled flux rates of both GHGs to catchment level resulted in emission of 322 and 211 kg CO-equivalents ha year for Strdam and Vestskoven, respectively, with NO contributing the most at both sites. Although the wet and intermediate wet forest soils occupied less than half the catchment area at both sites, the global warming potential (GWP) derived from NO and CH was more than doubled when accounting for these wet areas in the catchments. The results stress the importance of wet soils in assessments of forest soil global warming potentials, as even small proportions of wet soils contributes substantially to the emissions of NO and CH.
20456414|Fluctuating soil redox regimes may facilitate the co-occurrence of microbial nitrogen transformations with significantly different sensitivities to soil oxygen availability. In an upland humid tropical forest, we explored the impact of fluctuating redox regimes on gross nitrogen cycling rates and microbial community composition. Our results suggest that the rapidly fluctuating redox conditions that characterize these upland soils allow anoxic and oxic N processing to co-occur. Gross nitrogen mineralization was insensitive to soil redox fluctuations. In contrast, nitrifiers in this soil were directly affected by low redox periods, yet retained some activity even after 3-6 weeks of anoxia. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was less sensitive to oxygen exposure than expected, indicating that the organisms mediating this reductive process were also tolerant of unfavorable (oxic) conditions. Denitrification was a stronger sink for
1469127| There is greater biodiversity (in the sense of genetic distance among higher taxa) of extant marine than of terrestrial O<sub>2</sub>-evolvers. In addition to contributing the genes from one group of algae (Class Charophyceae, Division Chlorophyta) to produce by evolution the dominant terrestrial plants (Embryophyta), the early marine O<sub>2</sub>-evolvers greatly modified the atmosphere and hence the land surface when the early terrestrial O<sub>2</sub>-evolvers grew. The earliest terrestrial phototrophs (from geochemical evidence) occurred 1.2 Ga ago, over 0.7 Ga before the Embryophyta evolved, but well after the earliest marine (cyanobacterial) O<sub>2</sub> evolvers (3.45 Ga) and marine eukaryotic O<sub>2</sub> evolvers (2.1 Ga). Even by the time of evolution of the earliest terrestrial O<sub>2</sub>-evolvers the marine O<sub>2</sub>-evolvers had modified the atmosphere and land environment in at least the following five ways. Once photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> paralleling organic C burial had satisfied marine (Fe<sup>2+</sup>,S<sup>2-</sup>) reductants, atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> built (1) up to a considerable fraction of the extant value (although some was consumed in oxidising terrestrial exposed Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and (2) provided stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> and thus a UV-screen. (3) CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown to 20-30 times the extant level is attributable to net production, and burial, of organic C in the oceans (plus other geological processes). Furthermore, (4) their production of volatile organic S compounds could have helped to supply S to inland sites but also (5) delivered Cl and Br to the stratosphere thus lowering the O<sub>3</sub> level and the extent of UV screening. 
40800592|Decreases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) with increasing depth below the groundwater table are often considered as evidence for aerobic respiration; however, they may reflect mixing of infiltrating water and groundwater. We found that groundwater DOC concentration was on average 0.3 mg C1 higher and DO concentration 1.5 mg O 1 lower at recharge sites replenished with stormwater than at reference sites fed by direct infiltration of rain water from the land surface. Groundwater DOC increased and DO decreased with increasing vadose zone thickness (VZT) at both recharge and reference sites. There was no significant interaction between the effects of stormwater infiltration and VZT. Vertical changes in DOC and DO below the groundwater table at recharge sites could account for by simple mixing of infiltrating stormwater and groundwater. Moreover, aquifer sediment respiration (SR) was not significantly higher at recharge sites than at reference sites. However, slow filtration column experiments showed that SR increased significantly with an increasing supply of easily biodegradable DOC. We conclude that the observed reduction in DOC below the groundwater table at recharge sites was essentially due to water mixing rather than biological uptake because of the low biodegradability of the DOC and the short transit time of stormwater in the upper layers of groundwater. Our results highlight the need to distinguish between the effect of hydrological and biological processes on DOC and DO patterns below the groundwater before conclusions are made on the efficiency of groundwater in degrading surface-derived DOC.
20519812|Organic nutrients have proven to contribute significantly to nutrient cycling in temperate forest ecosystems. Still, little is known about their relevance in the tropics. In the present study, organic C, N, S and P were analysed in rainfall, throughfall, litter percolate and soil solution of a montane rainforest at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. The aim was to determine the amounts of organic nutrients in different water pathways and to assess the influence of forest disturbance on organic nutrients by comparing mature forests, secondary forests and shrub vegetation in clearings. Concentrations of all studied elements increased from rainfall to throughfall and litter percolate and then exhibited a rapid decrease in the mineral soil. Concentrations of organic P were above the detection limit only in the litter percolate. Organic N (ON) as a fraction of total N increased from 50% in rainfall (0.19 mg l) to 66% (0.45 mg l) in throughfall followed by a decline to 39% in the litter percolate (0.77 mg l) of the mature forest. Similarly, proportions of organic S and P amounted to 43 and 34%, respectively, in the litter percolate in mature forest. For ON, this proportion further decreased to less than 10% in the soil solution. The latter was probably attributable to a high sorption capacity of the studied Andisols, which led to overall low organic element concentrations in the soil solution (OC: 1.2 mg l, ON: 0.05 mg l at 1 m soil depth) as compared to other temperate and tropical forest ecosystems. Organic element concentrations were higher in litter percolate and soil solution under the clearings, but there were no differences in the relative contribution of these elements. Organic nutrient forms at Mt. Kilimanjaro appeared to be much less susceptible to leaching than their inorganic forms.
1469637|Human activities have more than doubled the inputs of nitrogen (N) into terrestrial systems globally. The sources and distribution of anthropogenic N, including N fertilization and N fixed during fossil fuel combustion, are rapidly shifting from the temperate zone to a more global distribution. The consequences of anthropogenic N deposition for ecosystem processes and N losses have been studied primarily in N-limited ecosystems in the temperate zone; there is reason to expect that tropical ecosystems, where plant growth is most often limited by some other resource, will respond differently to increasing deposition. In this paper, we assess the likely direct and indirect effects of increasing anthropogenic N inputs on tropical ecosystem processes. We conclude that anthropogenic inputs of N into tropical forests are unlikely to increase productivity and may even decrease it due to indirect effects on acidity and the availability of phosphorus and cations. We also suggest that the direct effects of anthropogenic N deposition on N cycling processes will lead to increased fluxes at the soil-water and soil-air interfaces, with little or no lag in response time. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties inherent in this analysis, and outline future research that is needed to address those uncertainties.
1468829|An Arizona watershed converted from chaparral to grass, released high concentrations of nitrate to stream water. The nitrate originated from the rooting zone of the decomposing shrubs. High nitrate concentrations (44-373 ppm) were found in soil solutions from 1.5-, 3.0-, and 4.6-m depths on the converted watershed as compared with low nitrate concentrations (0.2-6.2 ppm) found in an adjacent undisturbed area. Soil solution nitrate concentrations at the 0.3-m depth were generally low, especially in the untreated area. High nitrate concentrations were balanced mainly by relative decreases in bicarbonate anions in the soil solutions and in the stream water. Multiple stepwise regression analyses showed improvement in the regression of bicarbonate on nitrate when chloride and sulfate anions were entered as variables.
1469728|Studies in Germany and confirmed in North America established that the forest decline that developed in the late 1970's and 80's resulted from a deficiency in one or more of the nutrient cations: Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>. These nutrients are essential to the structure of the foliage, to photosynthesis and to the growth of the trees. The reactions and mechanisms involved in the entry of nutrients to the soil, their storage, and rate of transfer to the soil solution, and through it, to the fine roots and to the leaves at the top of the tree are reviewed. The continuing material balance studies carried out on a watershed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire allow a unique analysis of the changes caused in these nutrient transfers by acid rain. The nutrient cations are stored in the soil by adsorption on negatively charged clay, and the presence of an acid is required for their release to the soil solution. In pre-industrial times this acid was H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which was subsequently displaced from the soil solution by H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub>, as a result of acid deposition. The effect of the increased concentration of the negatively charged SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> anions seeping through the soil, compared with that of the HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> that had been previously present, resulted in a substantially increased rate of transfer of an equivalent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and other positively charged nutrient cations from the soil to the soil solution. The increased concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the soil solution resulted in both an initial increase in the rate of biomass growth and in a simultaneous increase in the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> loss in the effluent soil solution from the watershed. It was found that this increased rate of removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the watershed soil had become greater than its rate of input to the soil from weathering and from dust and rain. As a result, the large Ca<sup>2+</sup> inventory that had built up in the soil as a result of the reduced leaching in the years prior to the entry of acid rain, that started in about the 1880's, was eventually depleted in the hardwood forest at Hubbard Brook in the 1980's, about 100 years later. With insufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> available for its continuing transfer, net biomass growth on the watershed stopped. This resulted from the rate of tree mortality becoming equal to that of the small incremental growth of a few trees on the watershed. The future growth of forests is at risk from the long-term effects of acid deposition. The fundamental nature of the reactions involved indicates that similar growth anomalies are occurring in other forests impacted by acid rain. These changes from normal biomass growth can affect the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> stored in the biomass, of importance to our understanding of Global Warming.
1469440|Long-term data on nitrogen chemistry of streams draining Konza Prairie Biological Station (Konza), Kansas were analyzed to assess spatial and temporal patterns and examine the influence of agricultural activity on these patterns. Upland watersheds of Konza are predominantly tallgrass prairies, but agricultural fields and riparian forests border the lower reaches of the streams. We have up to 11 years of data in the relatively pristine upland reaches and 4 years of data on wells and downstream reaches influenced by fertilized croplands. Seasonal and spatial patterns in total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were driven largely by changes in the nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) concentrations. A gradient of increasing NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations occurred from pristine upland stream reaches to the more agriculturally-influenced lowland reaches. Nitrate concentrations varied seasonally and were negatively correlated with discharge in areas influenced by row-crop agriculture (p = 0.007). The NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations of stream water in lowland reaches were lowest during times of high precipitation, when the relative influence of groundwater drainage is minimal and water in the channel is primarily derived from upland prairie reaches. The groundwater from cropland increased stream NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations about four-fold during low-discharge periods, even though significant riparian forest corridors existed along most of the lower stream channel. The minimum NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in the agriculturally influenced reaches were greater than at any time in prairie reaches. Analysis of data before and after introduction of bison to four prairie watersheds revealed a 35% increase of TN concentrations (p < 0.05) in the stream water channels after the introduction of bison. These data suggest that natural processes such as bison grazing, variable discharge, and localized input of groundwater lead to variation in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations less than 100-fold in prairie streams. Row-crop agriculture can increase NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations well over 100-fold relative to pristine systems, and the influence of this land use process over space and time overrides natural processes.
1468802|For any element which is incorporated into biomass, the biogeochemical cycle of that element in a given ecosystem will be coupled to that of any other element similarly incorporated. The mutual interaction of two such cycles is examined using a simple model in which each cycle is constrained into four compartments. In each cycle the assimilation rate (primary productivity) is related in a non-linear fashion to the two nutrients and to biomass. The interactions are represented by combining a hyperbolic dependence for each nutrient (involving a "Michaelis constant") with a logistic equation governing the dependence of rate on biomass (involving a "carrying capacity"). The response of the model to perturbation (e.g. mobilization of an abiotic reserve) is strongly governed by the values assigned to these constants. The coupled cycles can exhibit positive feed-back with anomalous responses of the steady state and time-dependent solutions may exhibit complex oscillatory behaviour. Both the steady-state sensitivity and the kinetic behaviour of such coupled systems are simplified if the range of atomic ratios permitted by the assimilation process is restricted. It will therefore be of importance to determine under what conditions the assimilation rates for different elements are governed by mass-action effects (Liebig's Law) or by stoichiometric constraints (Redfield ratios).
25652618|Transport and turnover of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important in the C cycle of organic soils. The concentration of DOC in soil water is buffered by adsorption to the soil matrix, and has been hypothesized to depend on the pool size of adsorbed DOC. We have studied the effect of frequent artificial excessive leaching events on concentration and flux of DOC in shallow, organic rich mountain soils. Assuming a constant Kd value for DOC adsorption to the soil matrix, we used these data to assess the change in the pool of adsorbed (or potential) DOC in the soil. The study involved manipulation of precipitation amount and frequency in summer and autumn in small, heathland catchments at Storgama, southern Norway. The shallow soils (1634 cm deep on average) limit the possibility for changes in water flow paths during events. The mini-catchments range in size from 75 to 98 m. Our data show that after leaching of about 1.2 g DOC m the DOC concentration in runoff declines by approximately 50%. From this we conclude that the pool size of adsorbed potential DOC in the shallow soils at any time is of the order 23 g m. Frequent episodes suggest that the replenishment rate, which depends on the decomposition rate of soil organic matter, is fast and the potential DOC pool could be fully restored probably within days during summer, but with some more time required in autumn, due to lower temperatures. Both pool size of potential DOC and replenishment rate are seasonally dependent. The pool of potential DOC, and thus the DOC concentration in discharge, is at their maximum in the growing season. However, under non-leaching conditions, the concentration of DOC in soil water and thus the pool size of potential DOC seems to level off, possibly due to conversion of DOC to less reversibly bound forms, or to further decomposition to CO.
20456473|We have carried out field and laboratory experiments to examine the iron requirements of colonial Phaeocystis antarctica in the Ross Sea. In December 2003, we performed an iron/light-manipulation bioassay experiment in the Ross Sea polynya, using an algal assemblage dominated by colonial Phaeocystis antarctica, collected from surface waters with an ambient dissolved Fe concentration of 0.4 nM. Results from this experiment suggest that P. antarctica growth rates were enhanced at high irradiance (50% of incident surface irradiance) but were unaffected by iron addition, and that elevated irradiance mediated a significant decrease in cellular chlorophyll a content. We also conducted a laboratory iron dose--response bioassay experiment using a unialgal, non-axenic strain of colonial P. antarctica and low-iron (&lt;0.2 nM) filtered seawater, both collected from the Ross Sea polynya in December 2003. By using rigorous trace-metal clean techniques, we performed this dose--response iron-addition experiment at 0C without using organic chelating reagents to control dissolved iron levels. At the relatively low irradiance of this experiment (20 E m s), estimated nitrate-specific growth rate as a function of dissolved iron concentration can be described by a Monod relationship, yielding a half-saturation constant with respect to growth of 0.45 nM dissolved iron. This value is relatively high compared to reported estimates for other Antarctic phytoplankton. Our results suggest that seasonal changes in the availability of both iron and light play critical roles in limiting the growth and biomass of colonial Phaeocystis antarctica in the Ross Sea polynya.
20456403|This study presents the latitudinal variation (from 60 30 N to 68 2 N latitude) of natural abundances of N in the foliage, humus and soils of boreal forests of Finland. Our results clearly showed that N concentration of the foliage did not change significantly with latitudes but their N values were significantly higher in higher latitude sites relative to that of the mid and lower latitude sites, indicating the different forms of N uptake at the higher latitudes compared to the lower latitudes. We assume that the higher foliage N values of the higher latitudes trees might be due to either more openness of N cycle (greater proportional N losses) in these latitudes compared to the sites of southern latitudes (lower N losses) or the differences in their mycorrhizal associations. Regression analysis showed that the temperature was the main factor influencing the N natural abundance of humus and soil of all forest ecosystems, both before and after clear-cut, whereas rainfall was the main controlling factor to the foliage N. Possible reasons behind the increasing N natural abundances of plants and soils with increasing latitudes are discussed in this paper. The clear-cut did not show any specific trend on the N fractionation in humus and soil, i.e. both N-enrichment and -depletion occurred after clear-cut.
41490532|Ombrotrophic (rain-fed) Sphagnum-mires do not significantly contribute to gaseous nitrogen (N) emissions to the atmosphere. However, increasing levels of  deposition reduce Sphagnum growth and moss cover. As a consequence, higher amounts of mineral  reach the underlying peat beneath the moss layer. The aim of our work was to determine the effects of supplementary  inputs to peat beneath Sphagnum magellanicum carpets. Peat cores were incubated in controlled laboratory conditions of temperature and humidity, and the impact of increasing  inputs was evaluated on denitrification rates, basal respiration and methane emissions. Rates of denitrification were quickly stimulated by addition of 1 g N m but rates were not significantly elevated in the short-term (9 days) by further additions of up to 10 g N m. Over a longer term period (up to 45 days), denitrification rates followed an exponential (10 g N m addition) or a gamma (l g N m) function. Findings from this study support the hypothesis that mineral-N addition in atmospheric deposition will have a negative effect on peat biogeochemistry, by modifying its  sink capacity via denitrification leading to a potential increase in NO emissions.
1469403|Sulfur deposition in the northeastern U.S. has been decreasing since the 1970s and there has been a concomitant decrease in the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> lost from drainage waters from forest catchments of this region. It has been established previously that the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> lost from drainage waters exceeds SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> inputs in bulk precipitation, but the cause for this imbalance has not been resolved. The use of stable S isotopes and the availability of archived bulk precipitation and stream water samples at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire provided a unique opportunity to evaluate potential sources and sinks of S by analyzing the long-term patterns (1966-1994) of the  <sup>34</sup>S values of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. In bulk precipitation adjacent to the Ecosystem Laboratory and near Watershed 6 the  <sup>34</sup>S values were greater (mean: 4.5 and 4.21, respectively) and showed more variation (variance: 0.49 and 0.30) than stream samples from Watersheds 5 (W5) and 6 (W6) (mean: 3.2 and 3.7; variance: 0.09 and 0.08, respectively). These results are consistent with other studies in forest catchments that have combined results for mass balances with stable S isotopes. These results indicate that for those sites, including the HBEF, where atmospheric inputs are  10 kg S ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, most of the deposited SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> cycles through the biomass before it is released to stream water. Results from W5, which had a whole-tree harvest in 1983-1984 showed that adsorption/desorption processes play an important role in regulating net SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> retention for this watershed-ecosystem. Although the isotopic results suggest the importance of S mineralization, conclusive evidence that there is net mineralization has not yet been shown. However, S mass balances and the isotopic result are consistent with the mineralization of organic S being a major contributor to the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in stream waters at the HBEF.
20456425|An assessment of nutrient sustainability has been done for stands of European beech, Sycamore maple, European oak, Norway spruce, Larch, Grandis fir and Douglas fir at Bjrnstorp Estate in southern Sweden. To estimate the nutrient sustainability, mass balance was calculated with respect to Ca, Mg, K, N and P. The release from mineral weathering was calculated using the PROFILE model. The leaching has been estimated from observed soil water concentrations and nutrients removed by harvest from projected production. The results indicate that the planned production is on the limits of sustainability and sometimes in excess of it. The stands will overuse Ca, sometimes also Mg, K and P, if all growth is harvested. Soil acidification is still progessing at Bjrnstorp Estate, and soil depletion is the result of this. The estimated sustainable yield and the mass balances suggest that the leaching rate is the most uncertain factor for assessing sustainability. Different types of critical loads were investigated, including a new type, based on no excess acidity in the system. The calculations stress the importance of reducing the acid deposition and that nutrient sustainable management must be included in forest management.
24715103|Trace amounts of sulphur in speleothems suggest that stalagmites may act as archives of sulphur deposition, thereby recording aspects of atmospheric variability in sulphur content. Accurate interpretation of this novel sulphur archive depends upon understanding how biogeochemical cycling in the soil and epikarst above the cave may modify the precursor atmospheric values of sulphur concentration and isotopic composition prior to incorporation into the speleothem record. Dual isotope analysis of S-SO and O-SO is used to trace biogeochemical transformations of atmospheric sulphur through the cave system at Grotta di Ernesto in the Italian Alps and builds towards a framework for interpretation of speleothem sulphur archives which depends on over-lying ecosystem dynamics and karst hydrological properties. A three component model of atmospheric sulphate signal modification is proposed to be driven by (1). vegetation and soil cycling, (2). the degree of groundwater mixing in the karst aquifer; and (3). redox status. The relative influence of each process is specific to individual drip flow sites and associated stalagmites, rendering each sulphur archive a unique signal of environmental conditions. Under conditions found in the soil and epikarst above Grotta di Ernesto, the dual isotope signatures of sulphate sulphur and oxygen incorporated into speleothem carbonate, closely reflect past conditions of industrial sulphur loading to the atmosphere and the extent of signal modification through biogeochemical cycling and aquifer mixing.
1469292| To model nitrification rates in soils, it is necessary to have equations that accurately describe the effect of environmental variables on nitrification rates. A variety of equations have been used previously to describe the effect of temperature on rates of microbial processes. It is not clear which of these best describes the influence of temperature on nitrification rates in soil. I compared five equations for describing the effects of temperature on nitrification in two soils with very different temperature optima from a California oak woodland-annual grassland. The most appropriate equation depended on the range of temperatures being evaluated. A generalized Poisson density function best described temperature effects on nitrification rates in both soils over the range of 5 to 50 C; however, the Arrhenius equation best described temperature effects over the narrower range of soil temperatures that normally occurs in the ecosystem (5 to 28 C). Temperature optima for nitrification in most of the soils were greater than even the highest soil temperatures recorded at the sites. A model accounting for increased maintenance energy requirements at higher temperatures demonstrates how net energy production, rather than the gross energy production from nitrification, is maximized during adaptation by nitrifier populations to soil temperatures. 
40343594|Throughout a 13 year period, the Throughfall Displacement Experiment sustained both increased (+33; wet) and decreased (33%; dry) throughfall into an upland oak forest in Tennessee. Organic (O) horizon carbon (C) stocks were measured at several occasions before, during and after the experiment and mineral soil C stocks before and after the experiment. In the O horizon, higher C stocks were observed in the dry treatment compared to the ambient and wet, attributable to a combination of enhanced litter inputs and reduced decomposition. No precipitation treatment effects on mineral soil C stocks were found to a depth of 60 cm. Conversely, long-term reductions in surface mineral soil C stocks were surprisingly high for all treatments (3.5-2.7% C in the 0-15 cm layer and from 0.6 to 0.5% in the 15-30 cm layer) over the duration of the experiment. A clear explanation for this temporal trend in C storage was not readily apparent.
1468669|In a mature mixed subalpine stand of Tsuga mertensiana and Abies amabilis, significantly higher Al levels were found in foliage, branch and root tissues of T. mertensiana. Tsuga mertensiana had significant increases in Al, Ca and Mn levels with increasing foliage age. In current foliage, T. mertensiana had lower levels of Ca, similar levels of Mg and P, and higher levels of Mn than A. amabilis. Both tree species had Cu and Fe present at higher levels in branch than foliage tissues. Fine roots had the highest concentrations of Al, Fe and Cu but the lowest Ca and Mn concentrations of all tissues analyzed. In the roots of both species, phloem tissues always had significantly higher Al levels than xylem. Fine roots (< 1 and 1-2mm) of T. mertensiana had higher Al levels than were found in A. amabilis. Roots greater than 2mm in diameter exhibited no significant differences in Al levels in phloem or xylem tissue between A. amabilis and T. mertensiana. The two species show a clear difference in their ability to accumulate specific elements from the soil.
1468500| Sulfate reduction and sulfide accumulation were examined in fine-grained sediments from rapidly accreting abandoned channels and mussel culture areas in the Eastern Scheldt, which covered 4 and 5% of the total surface area, respectively. Reduction rates were measured in batch experiments in which the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> depletion was measured during anoxic incubation. The reduction rates in summer varied between 14-68 mmol SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> and were related to the sedimentation rate. In the most rapidly accreting channels, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was exhausted below 15-50 cm and methanogenesis became the terminal process of organic carbon oxidation. One-dimensional modelling of sulfate profiles in mussel banks indicated that the subsurface influx of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was almost of the same order as the diffusive flux at the sediment-seawater interface, during the initial stages of the mussel bank accretion. The energy dissipation of waves and tidal currents on the mussel bank surface increased the apparent sediment diffusivity up to 3-fold, especially in the winter. The results indicate that acid volatile sulfide (AVS) was the major, in-situ reduced, sulfur compound in the sediment. The sulfidation of easily extractable iron was nearly complete. Pyrite concentrations (40-80 M S cm<sup>-3</sup>) were as high as the AVS concentrations, but there was apparently no in-situ transformation of AVS into pyrite. The detrital pyrite originated from eroding marine sediments elsewhere. 
41410551|Riparian soils exert a major control on stream water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in northern latitudes. As the winter climate in northern regions is predicted to be particularly affected by climate change, we tested the sensitivity of DOC formation to winter conditions in riparian soils using an 8 year field-scale soil frost manipulation experiment in northern Sweden. In conjunction with the field experiment, we also carried out a laboratory experiment based on three levels of four winter climatic factors: frost intensity, soil water content, frost duration and frequency of freeze-thaw cycles. We evaluated changes in lability of DOC in soil solution from lysimeter samples taken at different depths (10-80 cm) as well as from DOC extracted from soils in the laboratory, using carbon-specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (sUVA). In the field, significantly more labile DOC was observed during the spring and summer from upper horizons of frost-exposed soils, when compared to controls. In addition, the amount of labile DOC was positively correlated with frost duration at a soil depth of 10 cm. In the laboratory, frost intensity was the factor that had the greatest positive influence on DOC lability; it also reduced the C:N ratio which may indicate a microbial origin of the DOC. The laboratory experiment also demonstrated significant interactions between some of the applied climatic factors, such as frost intensity interacting with water content. In combination, field and laboratory experiments demonstrate that winter soil conditions have profound effects on DOC-concentration and quality during subsequent seasons.
1468542| Field measures of tree and shrub dimensions were used with established biomass equations in a stratified two-stage cluster sample design to estimate the above-ground ovendry woody biomass of the North American boreal forest. The forest boundaries and sampling strata were defined using several environmental factors. The biomass averaged 4.18  1.01 (95% C.I.) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and totaled 21.5 10<sup>9</sup> 5.2 10<sup>9</sup> (95% C.I.) metric tons, providing the first statistically reliable estimate of vegetation biomass for any large area of the Earth. Carbon content was calculated to be 1.9 0.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and totaled 9.7 10<sup>9</sup> 2.3 10<sup>9</sup> metric tons. These values are much lower than previous estimates used in analysis of the global carbon budget, which range from 12 to 18 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for the above ground biomass and from 5.6 to 7.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for carbon content. The main reason for this large difference is the biased nature of the earlier estimates. Other reasons for this lower new biomass value and its implications for our understanding of the global carbon cycle are discussed. 
24715121|Prompted by recent observations of seasonal low dissolved oxygen from two moorings in the North Sea, a hydrographic survey in August 2010 mapped the spatial extent of summer oxygen depletion. Typical near-bed dissolved oxygen saturations in the stratified regions of the North Sea were 7580 % while the well-mixed regions of the southern North Sea reached 90 %. Two regions of strong thermal stratification, the area between the Dooley and Central North Sea Currents and the area known as the Oyster Grounds, had oxygen saturations as low as 65 and 70 % (200 and 180 mol dm) respectively. Low dissolved oxygen was apparent in regions characterised by low advection, high stratification, elevated organic matter production from the spring bloom and a deep chlorophyll maximum. Historical data over the last century from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea oceanographic database highlight an increase in seasonal oxygen depletion and a warming over the past 20 years. The 2010 survey is consistent with, and reinforces, the signal of recent depleted oxygen at key locations seen in the (albeit sparse) historical data.
20456494|We used the dual isotope method to study differences in nitrate export in two subwatersheds in Vermont, USA. Precipitation, soil water and streamwater samples were collected from two watersheds in Camels Hump State Forest, located within the Green Mountains of Vermont. These samples were analyzed for the N and O of <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math>. The range of <tex-math>$\delta {}^{15}\text{N}-\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> values overlapped, with precipitation -4.5 to +2.0 (n = 14), soil solution -10.3 to +6.2 (n = 12) and streamwater +0.3 to +3.1 (n = 69). The O of precipitation <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> (mean 46.8  11.5) was significantly different (P &lt; 0.001) from that of the stream (mean 13.2  4.3) and soil waters (mean 14.5  4.2) even during snowmelt periods. Extracted soil solution and streamwater O of <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> were similar and within the established range of microbially produced <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math>, demonstrating that <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> was formed by microbial processes. The N and O of <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> suggests that although the two tributaries have different seasonal <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> concentrations, they have a similar <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> source.
1468652|There is increasing interest in the importance of nitrogen gas emissions from natural (non-agricultural) ecosystems with respect to local as well as global nitrogen budgets and with respect to the effects of nitrogen oxides on atmospheric ozone levels and global warming. The volatile forms of nitrogen of common interest are ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), and NO<sub>x</sub> (principally NO+NO<sub>2</sub>). It is often difficult to attribute emissions of these compounds from soils to a single process because they are produced by a variety of common biogeochemical mechanisms. Although environmental conditions in the soil often appear to favor nitrogen gas emissions, the potential nitrogen gas emission rate from undisturbed ecosystems is rarely approached. The best estimates to date suggest that nitrogen gas emission rates from undisturbed ecosystems typically range from < 1 to perhaps 10 or 20 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Under certain conditions, however, emission rates may be much higher. For example, excreta from animals in grasslands may elevate ammonia volatilization up to 100 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> depending on grazer density; tidal input of nutrients to coastal wetlands may support denitrification rates of several hundred kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Excepting such cases, gaseous nitrogen losses are probably a small component of the local nitrogen budget in most undisturbed ecosystems. However, emissions from undisturbed soils are an important component of the global source strengths for (N<sub>2</sub>O+N<sub>2</sub>), N<sub>2</sub>O and NO<sub>x</sub> (50%, 21%, and 10% respectively). Emission rates of N<sub>2</sub>O from natural ecosystems are higher than assumed previously by perhaps 10 times. Large-scale disturbance may have a stimulatory effect on nitrogen emission rates which could have important effects on global nitrogen budgets. There is a need for more sophisticated methods to account for natural temporal and spatial variations of emissions rates, to more accurately and precisely assess their global source strengths.
20456555|Current estimates of soil C storage potential are based on models or factors that assume linearity between C input levels and C stocks at steady-state, implying that SOC stocks could increase without limit as C input levels increase. However, some soils show little or no increase in steady-state SOC stock with increasing C input levels suggesting that SOC can become saturated with respect to C input. We used long-term field experiment data to assess alternative hypotheses of soil carbon storage by three simple models: a linear model (no saturation), a one-pool whole-soil C saturation model, and a two-pool mixed model with C saturation of a single C pool, but not the whole soil. The one-pool C saturation model best fit the combined data from 14 sites, four individual sites were best-fit with the linear model, and no sites were best fit by the mixed model. These results indicate that existing agricultural field experiments generally have too small a range in C input levels to show saturation behavior, and verify the accepted linear relationship between soil C and C input used to model SOM dynamics. However, all sites combined and the site with the widest range in C input levels were best fit with the C-saturation model. Nevertheless, the same site produced distinct effective stabilization capacity curves rather than an absolute C saturation level. We conclude that the saturation of soil C does occur and therefore the greatest efficiency in soil C sequestration will be in soils further from C saturation.
41490437|The temperature response of soil respiration in deserts is not well quantified. We evaluated the response of respiration to temperatures spanning 67C from seven deserts across North America and Greenland. Deserts have similar respiration rates in dry soil at 20C, and as expected, respiration rates are greater under wet conditions, rivaling rates observed for more mesic systems. However, deserts differ in their respiration rates under wet soil at 20C and in the strength of the effect of current and antecedent soil moisture on the sensitivity and magnitude of respiration. Respiration increases with temperature below 30C but declines for temperatures exceeding 35C. Hot deserts have lower temperature sensitivity than cold deserts, and insensitive or negative temperature sensitivities were predicted under certain moisture conditions that differed among deserts. These results have implications for large-scale modeling efforts because we highlight the unique behavior of desert soil respiration relative to other systems. These behaviors include variable temperature responses and the importance of antecedent moisture conditions for soil respiration.
41490439|As the planet warms, widespread changes in Arctic hydrology and biogeochemistry have been documented and these changes are expected to accelerate in the future. Improved understanding of the behavior of water-borne constituents in Arctic rivers with varying hydrologic conditions, including seasonal variations in dischargeconcentration relationships, will improve our ability to anticipate future changes in biogeochemical budgets due to changing hydrology. We studied the relationship between seasonal water discharge and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC and DON) and nutrient concentrations in the upper Kuparuk River, Arctic Alaska. Fluxes of most constituents were highest during initial snowmelt runoff in spring, indicating that this historically under-studied period contributes significantly to total annual export. In particular, the initial snowmelt period (the stream is completely frozen during the winter) accounted for upwards of 35% of total export of DOC and DON estimated for the entire study period. DOC and DON concentrations were positively correlated with discharge whereas nitrate (NO) and silicate were negatively correlated with discharge throughout the study. However, discharge-specific DOC and DON concentrations (i.e. concentrations compared at the same discharge level) decreased over the summer whereas discharge-specific concentrations of NO and silicate increased. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium (NH) were negatively correlated with discharge during the spring thaw, but were less predictable with respect to discharge thereafter. These data provide valuable information on how Arctic watershed biogeochemistry will be affected by future changes in temperature, snowfall, and rainfall in the Arctic. In particular, our results add to a growing body of research showing that nutrient export per unit of stream discharge, particularly NO, is increasing in the Arctic.
40800595|We used radiocarbon measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to resolve sources of riverine carbon within agriculturally dominated landscapes in California. During 2003 and 2004, average C for DOC was -254% o in agricultural drains in the Sacramento-San Joaqun Delta,  218% o in the San Joaqun River,  175% o in the California State Water Project and  152% o in the Sacramento River. The age of bulk DOC transiting the rivers of California's Central Valley is the oldest reported for large rivers and suggests wide-spread loss of soil organic matter caused by agriculture and urbanization. Using DAX 8 adsorbent, we isolated and measured C concentrations in hydrophobic acid fractions (HPOA); river samples showed evidence of bomb-pulse carbon with average C of 91 and 76% o for the San Joaqun and Sacramento Rivers, respectively, with older HPOA,  204% o, observed in agricultural drains. An operationally defined non-HPOA fraction of DOC was observed in the San Joaqun River with seasonally computed C values of between  275 and  687%o; the source of this aged material was hypothesized to be physically protected organic-matter in high clay-content soils and agrochemicals (i. e., radiocarbon-dead material) applied to farmlands. Mixing models suggest that the Sacramento River contributes about 50% of the DOC load in the California State Water Project, and agricultural drains contribute approximately one-third of the load. In contrast to studies showing stabilization of soil carbon pools within one or two decades following land conversion, sustained loss of soil organic matter, occurring many decades after the initial agricultural-land conversion, was observed in California's Central Valley.
25652634|Grassland ecosystems are an important terrestrial component of the global biogeochemical silicon cycle. Although the structure and ecological functioning of grasslands are strongly influenced by fire and grazing, the role of these key ecological drivers in the production and storage of silicon represents a significant knowledge gap, particularly since they are being altered worldwide by human activities. We evaluated the effects of fire and grazing on the range and variability of plant derived biogenic silica stored in plant biomass and soils by sampling plants and soils from long-term experimental plots with known fire and grazing histories. Overall, plants and soils from grazed sites in the South African ecosystems had up to 76 and 54% greater biogenic silica totals (kg ha), respectively, than grazed North American sites. In North American soils, the combination of grazing and annual fire resulted in the greatest abundance of biogenic silica, whereas South African soils had the highest biogenic silica content where grazed regardless of burn frequency. These results as well as those that show greater Si concentrations in grazed South African plants indicate that South African plants and soils responded somewhat differently to fire and grazing with respect to silicon cycling, which may be linked to differences in the evolutionary history and in the grazer diversity and grazing intensity of these ecosystems. We conclude that although fire and grazing (as interactive and/or independent factors) do not affect the concentration of Si taken up by plants, they do promote increased silicon storage in aboveground biomass and soil as a result of directly affecting other site factors such as aboveground net primary productivity. Therefore, as management practices, fire and grazing have important implications for assessing global change impacts on the terrestrial biogeochemical cycling of silicon.
24715090|Nitrogen cycling processes affect radiative forcing directly through emissions of nitrous oxide (NO) and indirectly because emissions of nitrogen oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH) affect atmospheric concentrations of methane (CH), carbon dioxide (CO), water vapor (HO), ozone (O) and aerosols. The emissions of NO are mostly from agriculture and they contribute to warming on both short and long time scales. The effects of NO and NH on CH, O, and aerosols are complex, and quantification of these effects is difficult. However, the net result on time scales of decades is likely one of cooling, which becomes less significant on longer time scales. Deposition of N onto ecosystems also affects sources and sinks of NO, CH, and CO, but the dominant effect is changes in carbon (C) stocks. Primary productivity in most temperate ecosystems is limited by N, so inputs from atmospheric deposition tend to stimulate plant growth and plant litter production, leading in some cases to significant C sequestration in biomass and soils. The literature reviewed here indicates a range of estimates spanning 2070 kg C sequestered per kg N deposited in forests, which are the dominant C sinks. Most of the sequestration occurs in aboveground forest biomass, with less consistency and lower rates reported for C sequestration in soils. The permanency of the forest biomass sink is uncertain, but data for the fate of forest products in the US indicate that only a small fraction of enhanced forest biomass C is sequestered in long-term harvest products or in unmanaged forests. The net effect of all of these N cycle processes on radiative forcing in the US is probably a modest cooling effect for a 20-year time frame, although the uncertainty of this estimate includes zero net effect, and a modest warming for a 100-year time frame. We know that N-cycling processes are important and that biotic feedbacks to climate change are unlikely to be properly modeled or assessed without including CN interactions. However, due to the complexity of biological processes involving CNclimate interactions, biogeochemical models are still poorly constrained with respect to ecosystem responses to impacts of N deposition and climate change. Only recently have N-cycling processes been incorporated into Earth system models for CN interactions. The robustness of these models remains to be demonstrated. Much work remains for improving their representation in models used to simulate climate forcing scenarios.
20055212|Whole-system denitrification in the South Platte River was measured over a 13-month period using an open-channel N method and mass-balance measurements. Concentrations of dissolved N were measured with high precision by membrane-inlet mass spectrometry and estimates of denitrification were based on the mass flux of N, after correction for reaeration and groundwater flux. Open-channel estimates of denitrification ranged from 0 to 3.08 g N
20055161|The Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York receive among the highest rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in eastern North America, and ecosystems in the region may be sensitive to human disturbances that affect the N cycle. We studied the effects of a clearcut in a northern hardwood forest within a 24-ha Catskill watershed on the net rates of N mineralization and nitrification in soil plots during 6 years (1994-1999) that encompassed 3-year pre- and post-harvesting periods.

24715196|Lake Huron's submerged sinkhole habitats are impacted by high-conductivity groundwater that allows photosynthetic cyanobacterial mats to form over thick, carbon-rich sediments. To better understand nutrient cycling in these habitats, we measured the stable isotopic content of carbon and nitrogen in organic and inorganic carbon pools in Middle Island sinkhole, a ~23 m deep feature influenced by both groundwater and overlying lake water. Two distinct sources of dissolved CO (DIC) were available to primary producers. Lake water DIC (C = 0.1 ) differed by +5.9  from groundwater DIC (C = 6.0 ). Organic carbon fixed by primary producers reflected the two DIC sources. Phytoplankton utilizing lake water DIC were more enriched in C (C = 22.2 to 23.2 ) than mat cyanobacteria utilizing groundwater DIC (C = 26.3 to 30.0 ). Sinkhole sediments displayed an isotopic signature (C = 23.1 ) more similar to sedimenting phytoplankton than the cyanobacterial mat. Corroborated by sediment C/N ratios, these data suggest that the carbon deposited in sinkhole sediments originates primarily from planktonic rather than benthic sources. Pb/Cs radiodating suggests rapid sediment accumulation and sub-bottom imaging indicated a massive deposit of organic carbon beneath the sediment surface. We conclude that submerged sinkholes may therefore act as nutrient sinks within the larger lake ecosystem.
1468731|Because dry-deposition inputs are difficult to measure, they are often ignored in biogeochemical studies. In this study three separate methods were used to estimate dry deposition of nitrate to a deciduous forest (Walker Branch Watershed) in eastern Tennessee. The range of estimates of dry-deposition flux was from 1.8 to 9.1 kg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>- N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Using a hybrid approach that combines some aspects of all three methods, a best estimate of 4.8 kg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>- N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> was derived. About 75% of this flux is attributable to deposition of HNO<sub>3</sub>, vapor with large particles contributing most of the remainder; the contribution from small particles is negligible. The range of estimates obtained from the three techniques suggest that dry-deposition measurements should be interpreted with caution. Our best estimate indicates that dry deposition of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is the largest single form of inorganic nitrogen (N) deposition to this forest, contributing almost half of the 10.1 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> total annual input. All of the enhancement of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition in stemflow and throughfall relative to incident precipitation can be explained by washoff of dry-deposited NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and some canopy uptake of dry-deposited NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is suggested. This uptake occurs primarily during the growing season and contributes from 0.2 to 7.5 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> to the N requirements of the ecosystem, with a best estimate of 3.2. Despite the uncertainties, the magnitude of the potential input fluxes to forested ecosystems necessitates consideration of nitrate dry deposition in ecosystem nitrogen cycling studies.
1468633|The major S constituents in terrestrial ecosystems include inorganic SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, C-bonded S and ester sulfate with the organic fractions constituting the major soil S pools. Conceptual models of S dynamics link inorganic SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> flux to organic sulfur transformations and other elements such as N and C. Mass balance models have been useful in ascertaining whether a system is at steady-state with respect to adsorption processes and/or nutritional demands of vegetation for S. Chemical equilibrium/surface complexation models have been used to evaluate the effects of a complex of factors, including effects of pH on SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption and precipitation; these models have not generally been integrated into ecosystem models of S dynamics. Models such as ILWAS, Birkenes, Storgama, Trickle-Down and MAGIC were developed to ascertain surface water acidification processes within watersheds; these models incorporated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption in some formulation combined with hydrological considerations. None of these models explicitly treat organic S transformations and fluxes. In contrast, grassland ecosystem models detail organic S transformations, but give little attention to adsorption and hydrologic factors. More detailed simulation models of S transformations in forest and grassland soils have recently been developed, but these results have yet to be incorporated into ecosystem and watershed models.
1469543| Processes affecting the concentration and isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were investigated in pore waters of two freshwater intertidal areas of the Scheldt Estuary, Belgium. Pore water  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> values from marshes and mudflats varied from -27 to +13.4, these very large variations reflect the contribution of different carbon sources to the DIC pool. In pore waters of the upper mudflat, river water DIC and dissolution of calcite contribute to a lesser extent (10% and 16% respectively) to the total DIC pool. Results indicate that inorganic carbon added to the pore water of the mudflats has a  <sup>13</sup>C value of +20.3 in May 1998. These strongly enriched  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> values suggest that the major contribution (up to three-quarters) to total DIC is CO<sub>2</sub> derived from methanogenesis. In pore waters of the marshes, CO<sub>2</sub> derived from organic matter degradation (-27.5) and river DIC (-11.5 to -16.1) are the major sources of inorganic carbon contribution to the total DIC pool. In pore waters from a marsh site colonised by willow trees, the contribution from CO<sub>2</sub> derived from organic matter degradation is larger than in pore waters from an area with only reed vegetation. In the latter case river water DIC is the major source of pore water DIC. 
25652615|Climatic warming will probably have particularly large impacts on carbon fluxes in high altitude and latitude ecosystems due to their great stocks of labile soil C and high temperature sensitivity. At the alpine treeline, we experimentally warmed undisturbed soils by 4 K for one growing season with heating cables at the soil surface and measured the response of net C uptake by plants, of soil respiration, and of leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Soil warming increased soil CO effluxes instantaneously and throughout the whole vegetation period (+45%; +120 g C m y). In contrast, DOC leaching showed a negligible response of a 5% increase (NS). Annual C uptake of new shoots was not significantly affected by elevated soil temperatures, with a 17, 12, and 14% increase for larch, pine, and dwarf shrubs, respectively, resulting in an overall increase in net C uptake by plants of 2040 g C my. The Q of 3.0 measured for soil respiration did not change compared to a 3-year period before the warming treatment started, suggesting little impact of warming-induced lower soil moisture (-15% relative decrease) or increased soil C losses. The fraction of recent plant-derived C in soil respired CO from warmed soils was smaller than that from control soils (25 vs. 40% of total C respired), which implies that the warming-induced increase in soil CO efflux resulted mainly from mineralization of older SOM rather than from stimulated root respiration. In summary, one season of 4 K soil warming, representative of hot years, led to C losses from the studied alpine treeline ecosystem by increasing SOM decomposition more than C gains through plant growth.
1469626| At five European sites, differing in atmospheric S inputs by a factor of 6, and differing in S isotope signatures of these inputs by up to 14 (CDT), we investigated the direction and magnitude of an assimilation-related  <sup>34</sup>S shift and the relationship between atmospheric deposition and S retention in selected ecosystem compartments. Bulk precipitation and spruce throughfall were collected between 1994 and 1996 in the Isle of Mull (Scotland), Connemara (Ireland), Thorne Moors (England), Rybrensk slat' and Ocen (both Czech Republic) and analyzed for sulfate concentrations and  <sup>34</sup>S ratios. Eighteen replicate samples per site of living Sphagnum collected in unforested peatlands and 18 samples of spruce forest floor collected near each of the peatlands were also analyzed for S concentrations and  <sup>34</sup>S ratios. Assimilation of S was associated with a negative  <sup>34</sup>S shift. Plant tissues systematically preferred the light isotope <sup>32</sup>S, on average by 2. There was a strong positive correlation between the non-marine portion of the atmospheric S input and total S concentration in forest floor and Sphagnum, respectively (R = 0.97 and R = 0.85). Elevated S inputs lead to higher S retention in these two organic-rich compartments of the ecosystem. It follows that equal emphasis must be placed on organic S as on adsorption/desorption of inorganic sulfate when studying acidification reversal in ecosystems. The sea-shore sites had rainfall enriched in the heavy isotope <sup>34</sup>S due to an admixture of sea-spray. The inland sites had low  <sup>34</sup>S reflecting  <sup>34</sup>S of sulfur emitted from local coal-burning power stations. Sphagnum had always lower S contents and higher  <sup>34</sup>S ratios compared to forest floor. The within-site range of  <sup>34</sup>S ratios of Sphagnum and forest floor was wide (up to 12) suggesting that at least six replicate samples should be taken when using  <sup>34</sup>S as a tracer.

Emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and uptake of CH<sub>4</sub> for the control plot were 4.92 MT C ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> and 3.87 kg C ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and were not significantly different from the blowdown plot. Annual N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the control plot (0.23 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>) were low and were reduced 78% by the blowdown. Net N mineralization was not affected by the blowdown. Net nitrification was greater in the blowdown than in the control, however, the absolute rate of net nitrification, as well as the proportion of mineralized N that was nitrified, remained low. Fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> were correlated positively to soil temperature, and CH<sub>4</sub> uptake showed a negative relationship to soil moisture. Substantial resprouting and leafing out of downed or damaged trees, and increased growth of understory vegetation following the blowdown, were probably responsible for the relatively small differences in soil temperature, moisture, N availability, and net N mineralization and net nitrification between the control and blowdown plots, thus resulting in no change in CO<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes, and no increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions.
20519890|Soil microbial respiration is a critical component of the global carbon cycle, but it is uncertain how properties of microbes affect this process. Previous studies have noted a thermodynamic trade-off between the rate and efficiency of growth in heterotrophic organisms. Growth rate and yield determine the biomass-specific respiration rate of growing microbial populations, but these traits have not previously been used to scale from microbial communities to ecosystems. Here we report seasonal variation in microbial growth kinetics and temperature responses (Q) in a coniferous forest soil, relate these properties to cultured and uncultured soil microbes, and model the effects of shifting growth kinetics on soil heterotrophic respiration (
20519778|The effects of elevated CO (ambient, +175, and +350 l l) and nitrogen fertilization (0, 100, and 200 kg N ha yr as ammonium sulfate) on C and N accumulations in biomass and soils planted with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) over a 6-year study period are reported. Both nitrogen fertilization and elevated CO caused increases in C and N contents of vegetation over the study period. The pattern of responses varied over time. Responses to CO decreased in the +175 l l and increased in the +350 l l after the first year, whereas responses to N decreased after the first year and became non-significant by year six. Foliar N concentrations were lower and tree C:N ratios were higher with elevated CO in the early years, but this was offset by the increases in biomass, resulting in substantial increases in N uptake with elevated CO. Nitrogen budget estimates showed that the major source of the N for unfertilized trees, with or without elevated CO, was likely the soil organic N pool. There were no effects of elevated CO on soil C, but a significant decrease in soil N and an increase in soil C:N ratio in year six. Nitrogen fertilization had no significant effect on tree C:N ratios, foliar N concentrations, soil C content, soil N content, or soil C:N ratios. There were no significant interactions between CO and N treatments, indicating that N fertilization had no effect on responses to CO and that CO treatments had no effect on responses to N fertilization. These results illustrate the importance of long-term studies involving more than one level of treatment to assess the effects of elevated CO.
23359745|In the root zone of rice plants aerobic methanotrophic bacteria catalyze the oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> to CO<sub>2</sub>, thereby reducing CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from paddy soils to the atmosphere. However, methods for in situ quantification of microbial processes in paddy soils are scarce. Here we adapted the pushpull tracer-test (PPT) method to quantify CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in the root zone of potted rice plants. During a PPT, a test solution containing CH<sub>4</sub>  O<sub>2</sub> as reactant(s), Cl<sup>-</sup> and Ar as nonreactive tracers, and BES as an inhibitor of CH<sub>4</sub> production was injected into the root zone at different times throughout the circadian cycle (daytime, early nighttime, late nighttime). After a 2-h incubation phase, the test solution/pore-water mixture was extracted from the same location and rates of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation were calculated from the ratio of measured reactant and nonreactive tracer concentrations. In separate rice pots, O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the vicinity of rice roots were measured throughout the circadian cycle using a fiberoptic sensor. Results indicated highly variable CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rates following a circadian pattern. Mean rates at daytime and early nighttime varied from 62 up to 451 mol l<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, whereas at late nighttime CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rates were low, ranging from 13 to 37 mol l<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Similarly, daytime O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the vicinity of rice roots increased to up to 250% air saturation, while nighttime O<sub>2</sub> concentration dropped to below detection (<0.15% air saturation). Our results suggest a functional link between root-zone CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation and photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> supply.
1468883| Fluxes of N<sub>2</sub>O at the soil surface, dissolved N<sub>2</sub>O in near-surface groundwater, and potential N<sub>2</sub>O production rates were measured across riparian catenas in two rain forest watersheds in Puerto Rico. In the Icacos watershed, mean N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were highest at topographic breaks in the landscape (40-300 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). At other locations in the riparian zone and hillslope, fluxes were lower ( 2 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). This pattern of surface N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes was persistent. In the Bisley watershed, mean suface N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were lower (<40 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) and no identifiable spatial or temporal pattern. Although the spatial patterns and intensities of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions differed between the two watersheds, surface soils from both sites had a high potential to reduce NO<sub>3</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>O (and perhaps N<sub>2</sub>). This potential declined sharply with depth as did soil %C, %N, and potential N-mineralization. Simple controls on denitrification (i.e. aeration, nitrate, and carbon) explained characteristics of potential N<sub>2</sub>O production in surface and deep soils from riparian and upslope locations. In the field, spatial patterns in these controlling variables were defined by geomorphological differences between the two watersheds, which then explained the spatial patterns of observed N<sub>2</sub>O flux. 
1469762| To better understand carbon (C) cycling in arctic tundra we measured dissolved C production and export rates in mesocosms of three tundra vegetation types: tussock, inter-tussock and wet sedge. Three flushing frequencies were used to simulate storm events and determine potential mass export of dissolved C under increased soil water flow scenarios. Dissolved C production and export rates differed between vegetation types (inter-tussock > tussock > wet sedge). In the absence of flushing, dissolved organic C (DOC) dominated production in tussock and inter-tussock soils but was consumed in wet sedge soils (8.3, 32.7, and -0.4 g C g soil<sup>-1</sup>day<sup>-1</sup>). Soil water dissolved C concentrations declined over time when flushed at high and medium frequencies but were variable at low flushing frequency. Total yield of dissolved C and DOC increased with increased flushing frequency. The ratio of DOC to dissolved inorganic C exported dropped with increased flushing under tussock but not inter-tussock or wet sedge vegetation. Mass export per liter of water added declined as flushing frequency increased in tussock and inter-tussock mesocosms. Export and production of dissolved C were strongly correlated with above ground biomass, but not with photosynthetic rates or below ground biomass. DOC quality was examined by measuring production of Toolik Lake bacteria fed mesocosm soil water. When normalized for DOC concentration, wet sedge soil water supported significantly higher bacterial production. Our results indicate that arctic tundra soils have high potentials for dissolved C export, that water flow and vegetation type mainly control dissolved C export, and that responses of aquatic microbes to terrestrial inputs depend on the vegetation type in the watershed. 
40647949|We examined seasonal and spatial linkages between N cycling and organic matter for a suburban stream in Maryland and addressed the question: How do longitudinal NH uptake patterns vary seasonally and what is the effect of organic matter, stream size, transient storage and debris dams? We applied a longitudinal (stream channel corridor) approach in a forested stream section and conducted short-term nutrient addition experiments (adapted to account for the effect of nutrient saturation) covering 14-16 reaches, and compared two distinct seasons (late fall 2003 and late summer 2004). Longitudinal NH uptake rate patterns had a distinct seasonal reversal; fall had the highest uptake rates in the upper reaches, while summer had the highest uptake rates in the lower reaches. This seasonal reversal was attributed to organic matter and evidenced by DON patterns. Transient storage did not have an expected effect on uptake rates in fall because it was confounded by leaf litter; litter produced higher uptakes, but also may have reduced transient storage. In summer however, uptake rates had a positive correlation with transient storage. Debris dams had no distinct effect on uptake in fall because of their recent formation. In summer however, the debris dam effect was significant; although the debris dams were hydraulically inactive then, the upstream reaches had 2-5 fold higher uptake rates. The seasonal and longitudinal differences in NH uptake reflect interactions between flow conditions and the role of organic matter. Urbanization can alter both of these characteristics, hence affect stream N processing.
1469321| Mercury levels in fish in reservoirs and natural lakes have been monitored on a regular basis since 1978 at the La Grande hydroelectric complex located in the James Bay region of Qubec, Canada. The main analytical tools historically used were analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear regression of the mercury-to-length relationship and Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) multiple comparisons of mean mercury levels. Inadequacy of linear regression (mercury-to-length relationships are often curvilinear) and difficulties in comparing mean mercury levels when regressions differ lead us to use polynomial regression with indicator variables. For comparisons between years, polynomial regression models relate mercury levels to length (L), length squared (L<sup>2</sup>), binary (dummy) indicator variables (B<sub>n</sub>), each representing a sampled year, and the products of each of these explanatory variables (L B<sub>1</sub>, L<sup>2</sup> B<sub>1</sub>, L B<sub>2</sub>, etc.). Optimal transformations of the mercury levels (for normality and homogeneity) were found by the Box-Cox procedure. The models so obtained formed a partially nested series corresponding to four situations: (a) all years are well represented by a single polynomial model; (b) the year-models are of the same shape, but the means may differ; (c) the means are the same, but the year-models differ in shape; (d) both the means and shapes may differ among years. Since year-specific models came from the general one, rigorous statistical comparisons are possible between models. Polynomial regression with indicator variables allows rigorous statistical comparisons of mercury-to-length relationships among years, even when the shape of the relationships differ. It is simple to obtain accurate estimates of mercury levels at standardized length, and multiple comparisons of these estimations are simple to perform. The method can also be applied to spatial analysis (comparison of sampling stations), or to the comparison of different biological forms of the same species (dwarf and normal lake whitefish). 
1468603|Toxicity of waters within the North Branch of the Moose River to various life stages of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), and blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus) were examined in situ. Study sites were selected that were expected to range from toxic to favourable water quality. For example, pH varied from 4.25 to 7.17, inorganic monomeric Al ranged from ND (< 0.01 mg/l) to 0.40 mg/l, and Ca, from 0.41 to 4.27 mg/l. Toxicity tests were conducted at times when the life stages would naturally occur in these waters and were continued until a range of mortality was observed at the various sites. These experiments suggested that the extent of the drainage system that is toxic to fish increases during snowmelt and major runoff events. Summer base flow water quality was generally the least toxic. Critical life stages were upon hatching and as early feeding fry. In general, young of the year fish were the most tolerant life stage tested. Yearling and adult fish, however, were very sensitive. Blacknose dace were the most sensitive fish of the four species tested, and brook trout were the most tolerant. Hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) concentration was the most toxic variable in the majority of tests. Inorganic monomeric Al was the most toxic in several, and the combination of H<sup>+</sup> and Al seemed to cause increased toxicity in many instances. A three-variable model employing hours of exposure, H<sup>+</sup> concentration, and inorganic monomeric Al predicted mortality quite well. A simple two-variable model using H<sup>+</sup> and color was nearly as good (R<sup>2</sup> from 0.49 to 0.94). Documented differences in toxicity among sites and species agreed with observed patterns of fish distribution. These in situ results indicated that laboratory estimates of safe levels of pH and concentrations of Al can result in mortality of fishes in surface waters subject to acidification.
24715095|Biological nitrogen (N) fixation is the primary source of "new" N to unmanaged ecosystems, and recent analyses suggest that terrestrial N inputs via free-living N fixation may be more important than previously assumed. This may be particularly true in some tropical rain forests, where free-living fixation could outpace symbiotic N fixation to represent the dominant source of new N inputs. However, our understanding of the controls over free-living N fixation in tropical rain forests remains poor, which directly constrains our ability to predict how N cycling will respond to changing environmental conditions. Although both phosphorus (P) and molybdenum (Mo) availability have been shown to limit free-living N fixation rates in the tropics, few studies have simultaneously explored P versus Mo limitation or the potential importance of P  Mo interactions. Here, an archived set of foliar, litter, and soil samples from a Costa Rican tropical rain forest provided an opportunity to simultaneously assess the relative strength of P versus Mo relationships with free-living N fixation rates. We also conducted a short-term, full-factorial (P  Mo) litter incubation experiment to directly assess nutrient limitation, allowing us to explore P and Mo controls over free-living N fixation rates using both observational and experimental approaches. We previously showed that N fixation rates were positively correlated with P concentrations in all substrates and, using the archived samples, we now show that Mo concentrations correlated with N fixation only in canopy leaves (where total Mo concentrations were extremely low). Likewise, fertilization with P alone (and not Mo) stimulated leaf litter N fixation rates. Thus, our results suggest that P availability dominantly controls free-living N fixation at this site, and when taken with data from other studies, our results suggest that attempts to identify "the nutrient" that limits N fixation in "the tropics" may be misguided. Rather, nutrient controls over free-living N fixation appear to be more nuancedand the true nature of nutrient limitation to N fixation likely varies over a variety of scales across the vast tropical rain forest biome.
1469865| The link between methylmercury (MeHg) production and decomposition of flooded organic matter was examined using an enclosure experiment. Six plastic enclosures were filled with lake water containing low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (146  mol L<sup>-1</sup>) and MeHg (0.02 ng L<sup>-1</sup>) and anchored in a lake at the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario. Either fresh birch leaves, fresh jack pine needles, or no plant tissues at all were added to enclosures. Birch leaves decomposed 2.4 times faster than jack pine needles as measured by the total carbon decomposition by-products produced in enclosures over time. However, measured net MeHg production in enclosures containing birch leaves (0.35  0.05 ng per g carbon added) was five times lower than in the enclosures containing jack pine needles (1.94  0.28 ng per g carbon added). These results showed that MeHg production is not solely related to rates of organic matter decomposition, and that increases in MeHg associated with flooded birch leaves and jack pine needles resulted from the production of new MeHg as opposed to leaching of MeHg already in the plant tissues during decomposition. 
40647938|Atmospheric deposition contributes a large fraction of the annual nitrogen (N) input to the basin of the Susquehanna River, a river that provides two-thirds of the annual N load to the Chesapeake Bay. Yet, there are few measurements of the retention of atmospheric N in the Upper Susquehanna's forested headwaters. We characterized the amount, form (nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved organic nitrogen), isotopic composition (N-and O-nitrate), and seasonality of stream N over 2 years for 7-13 catchments. We expected high rates of N retention and seasonal nitrate patterns typical of other seasonally snow-covered catchments: dormant season maxima and growing season minima. Coarse estimates of N export indicated high rates of inorganic N retention (>95%), yet streams had unexpected seasonal nitrate patterns, with summer peaks (14-96 mol L), October crashes (<1 mol L), and modest rebounds during the dormant season (<1-20 mol L). Stream O-nitrate values indicated microbial nitrification as the primary source of stream nitrate, although snowmelt or other atmospheric source contributed up to 47% of stream nitrate in some March samples. The autumn nitrate crash coincided with leaffall, likely due to in-stream heterotrophic uptake of N. Hypothesized sources of the summer nitrate peaks include: delayed release of nitrate previously flushed to groundwater, weathering of geologic N, and summer increases in net nitrate production. Measurements of shale N and soil-, well-, and streamwater nitrate within one catchment point toward a summer increase in soil net nitrification as the driver of this pattern. Rather than seasonal plant demand, processes governing the seasonal production, retention, and transport of nitrate in soils may drive nitrate seasonality in this and many other systems.
1469818| The isotopic composition of methyl bromide (CH<sub>3</sub>Br) has been suggested to be a potentially useful tracer for constraining the global CH<sub>3</sub>Br budget. In order to determine the carbon isotopic composition of CH<sub>3</sub>Br emitted from the most significant anthropogenic application (pre-plant fumigation) we directly measured the  <sup>13</sup>C of CH<sub>3</sub>Br released during commercial fumigation. We also measured the isotopic fractionation associated with degradation in agricultural soil under typical field fumigation conditions. The isotopic composition of CH<sub>3</sub>Br collected in soil several hours after injection of the fumigant was -44.5 and this value increased to -20.7 over the following three days. The mean kinetic isotope effect (KIE) associated with degradation of CH<sub>3</sub>Br in agricultural soil (12) was smaller than the reported value for methylotrophic bacterial strain IMB-1, isolated from previously fumigated agricultural soil, but was similar to methylotrophic bacterial strain CC495, isolated from a pristine forest litter zone. Using this fractionation associated with the degradation of CH<sub>3</sub>Br in agricultural soil and the mean  <sup>13</sup>C of the industrially manufactured CH<sub>3</sub>Br (-54.4), we calculate that the agricultural soil fumigation source has a carbon isotope signature that ranges from -52.8 to -42.0. Roughly 65% of industrially manufactured CH<sub>3</sub>Br is used for field fumigations. The remaining 35% is used for structural and post-harvest fumigations with a minor amount used during industrial chemical manufacturing. Assuming that the structural and post-harvest fumigation sources of CH<sub>3</sub>Br are emitted without substantial fractionation, we calculate that the  <sup>13</sup>C of anthropogenically emitted CH<sub>3</sub>Br ranges from -53.2 to -47.5. 
1469977| The hypothesis that the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a reservoir of C, N, and P declines, relative to that of the particulate pool, with increasing nutrient inputs was tested using mesocosms exposed to a gradient of nutrient inputs in the Spanish Mediterranean. The nutrient additions included a treatment equivalent to the loading in the coastal ecosystem studied (5 mmol N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>), and mesocosms receiving half, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-fold this value, as well as a mesocosm to which no nutrients were added. Nutrients were added at ratios of 20 N (as ammonium): 7 Si: 1 P. The initial concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients was very low (dissolved inorganic nitrogen < 0.05 M, phosphate < 0.01) and comprised, together with the particulate pool < 25% of the total N and P in the system, with the bulk N and P in the system present as DOM (> 75%). Particulate and dissolved organic matter was depleted in N (C/N ratio > 15) and, particularly, P (C/P ratio > 1000), indicative of a strongly nutrient, particularly phosphorus, deficient ecosystem. Experimental nutrient additions lead to a parabolic change in C/N and C/P ratios in the dissolved organic matter with increasing nutrient inputs, which approached the Redfield stoichiometry at nutrient inputs > 8 fold above the ambient loading. The relative size of the dissolved inorganic nutrient pools (about 20% of the N and P) did not vary, but there was a tendency towards an increase in the relative size of the particulate pool at the expense of a decrease in the relative importance of DOM as a reservoir of N, P and C, with increasing nutrient inputs. The production of nutrient-depleted organic matter at low nutrient inputs likely prevents efficient recycling, leading to the dominance of nutrients in DOM in the system. 
20519888|The importance of snow and related cryospheric processes as an ecological factor has been recognized since at least the beginning of the twentieth century. Even today, however, many observations remain anecdotal. The research to date on cold-lands ecosystems results in scientists being unable to evaluate to what extent changes in the cryosphere will be characterized by abrupt changes in local and global biogeochemical cycles, and how these changes in seasonality may affect the rates and timing of key ecological processes. Studies of gas exchanges through snow have revealed that snow plays an important role in modulating wintertime soil biogeochemical processes, and that these can be the driving processes for gas exchange at the snow surface. Previous research has primarily focused on carbon dioxide, and resulted from episodic experiments at a number of snow-covered sites. Here we report new insights from several field sites on Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including a dedicated snow gas flux research facility established at the 3340 m Soddie site. A novel in situ experimental system was developed at this site to continuously sample trace gases from above and within the snow-pack for the duration of seasonal snow cover. The suite of chemical species investigated includes carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, and volatile inorganic and organic gases. Wintertime measurements have been supplemented by soil chamber experiments and eddy covariance measurements to allow assessment of the contribution of wintertime fluxes to annual biogeochemical budgets. This research has resulted in a plethora of new insight into the physics of gas transport through the snowpack, and the magnitude and the chemical and biogeochemical processes that control fluxes at the soil-snowpack and snow-atmosphere interface. This article provides an overview of the history and evolution of this research, and highlights the findings from the ten articles that constitute this special issue.
1469777|This study investigated the properties and sorption by goethite of bulk (unfractionated) dissolved organic matter (DOM) from surface and shallow groundwaters at McDonalds Branch, a small freshwater fen in the New Jersey Pine Barrens (USA). Water samples were collected in the spring and fall seasons from two surface-water sampling sites, an upstream potential recharge area and a downstream discharge area, as well as from a set of in-stream nested wells in the upstream potential recharge area. Changes in DOM concentration, molecular weight distribution, and molar absorptivity at 280 nm were measured. Surface and shallow (1.6 m below land surface) groundwater samples collected in spring 1997 in the potential recharge zone (actual recharge impeded by an extensive clay lens) were found to be very similar in terms of DOM concentrations and physicochemical properties and is believe to originate from a common source. Samples taken in fall 1997 yielded no surface water because of drought conditions, and the shallow groundwater DOM collected from the recharge well contained significantly less and chemically altered DOM. This change in chemical properties is believed to be caused in part by fractionation resulting from sorption to mineral phases. Batch isotherm experiments show that sorption by goethite of the DOM from both spring surface and shallow groundwaters in the potential recharge area were similar, whereas the fall groundwater possessed a much lower affinity for the sorbent. This study demonstrated that shallow groundwaters collected under different climatic and hydrologic conditions (spring, high flow versus fall, drought conditions) resulted in different physicochemical properties and adsorption affinities.
20519828|In tropical lakes relatively little is known about the general relationship between nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass. Using data from 192 lakes from tropical and subtropical regions we examine the relationship between total P (TP) and chlorophyll (Chl). The lakes are all located between 30 S to 31 N include systems in Asia, Africa, and North and South America but are dominated by Brazilian (n = 79) and subtropical N. American (n = 67) systems. The systems vary in morphometry (mean depth and lake area), trophic state as well total N (TN) to total P (TP) ratios and light extinction. Despite a nearly 500-fold range in TP concentrations (2-970 g P l), there was a poorer relationship between log TP and log Chl (r = 0.42) than is generally observed for temperate systems from either narrow or broad geographic regions. N limitation is not a likely explanation for the relatively weak TP-Chl relationship in the tropical-subtropical systems. Systems had high average TN:TP ratios and neither a multiple regression with log TP and log TN nor separating systems with high TN:TP (&gt; 17 by weight) improved the predictive power of the log TP-log Chl relationship.
1469861|Damming rivers changes sediment and nutrient cycles downstream of a dam in many direct and indirect ways. The Iron Gates I reservoir on the Yugoslavian-Romanian border is the largest impoundment by volume on the Danube River holding 3.2 billion m<sup>3</sup> of water. Silica retention within the reservoir in the form of diatom frustules was postulated to be as high as 600 kt year<sup>-1</sup> in previous studies using indirect methods. This amount of dissolved silicate was not delivered to the coastal Black Sea, and presumably caused a shift in the phytoplankton community there, and subsequent drastic decline in fishery. We directly quantified the amount of dissolved silicate (DSi) entering and leaving the reservoir for 11 continuous months. The budget based on these data reveals two important facts: (1) only about 4% of incoming DSi was retained in the reservoir; (2) the DSi concentrations were relatively low in the rivers upstream of the reservoir compared to regional and global averages. Thus damming the Danube at the Iron Gates could not have caused the decline in DSi concentrations documented downstream of the impoundment. Rather, this change in DSi must have occurred in the headwaters of the Danube River. Potential reasons include the construction of many dams upstream of the Iron Gates, hydrologic changes resulting in lower groundwater levels, and clogging of the riverbed limiting groundwater-river exchange.
1468741|In anoxic marine sediments fatty acids may be oxidized directly by sulfate reducing bacteria, or may be oxidized by pathways which result in hydrogen production. Some of these latter reactions are quite sensitive to hydrogen concentrations... in other words if hydrogen concentrations become elevated, fatty acid oxidation will cease. Thus sulfate reducers may actually play two important roles in the metabolism of fatty acids in marine sediments. The sulfate reducers both can utilize fatty acids directly, and also can oxidize hydrogen and thus control hydrogen partial pressures in the sediments. Therefore sulfate reducers may act indirectly to facilitate fatty acid oxidation by hydrogen-producing pathways. We carried out a series of incubations of slurried salt marsh sediment under high and low hydrogen partial pressures and in the presence and absence of molybdate to investigate the relative importance of sulfate reducers and other bacteria mediating hydrogen-sensitive reactions. Our results suggest that both classes of bacteria contribute significantly to fatty acid turnover in marine sediments. Studies of low molecular weight fatty acid turnover in sediment must explicitly recognize that manipulation of sediment (including addition of molydbate to inhibit sulfate reducers) may have a large impact on hydrogen partial pressures in sediment, and may thus significantly alter the pathways and/or rates of fatty acid turnover.
40343614|Nitrogen from atmospheric deposition serves as the dominant source of new nitrogen to forested ecosystems in the northeastern U. S. By combining isotopic data obtained using the denitrifier method, with chemical and hydrologic measurements we determined the relative importance of sources and control mechanisms on nitrate (NO) export from five forested watersheds in the Connecticut River watershed. Microbially produced NO was the dominant source (82-100%) of NO to the sampled streams as indicated by the N and O of NO. Seasonal variations in the O-NO in streamwater are controlled by shifting hydrologic and temperature affects on biotic processing, resulting in a relative increase in unprocessed NO export during winter months. Mass balance estimates find that the unprocessed atmospherically derived NO stream flux represents less than 3% of the atmospherically delivered wet NO flux to the region. This suggests that despite chronically elevated nitrogen deposition these forests are not nitrogen saturated and are retaining, removing, and reprocessing the vast majority of NO delivered to them throughout the year. These results confirm previous work within Northeastern U. S. forests and extend observations to watersheds not dominated by a snow-melt driven hydrology. In contrast to previous work, unprocessed atmospherically derived NO export is associated with the period of high recharge and low biotic activity as opposed to spring snowmelt and other large runoff events.
24715106|The rate at which CO is released from woody debris post-clearcut affects the long term carbon consequences of such disturbances. Changes in microclimate post-clearcut may alter the rate of woody debris decomposition from that in a mature forest. However, very few studies have explored post-disturbance rates of woody debris respiration and the possible influence of an altered microclimate, and even fewer have considered the role of log position in influencing rates of respiration. This study explored the effects of log position and microclimate variability on the rates of coarse woody debris (CWD) respiration. The rates of respiration of downed Norway spruce (Picea abies) logs were repeatedly measured in situ using an LI-6200 gas analyzer. Treatments included native logs in the clearcut site, native logs in a neighboring mature spruce stand, and logs transferred from the clearcut site to the mature spruce stand. The transfer logs showed the highest rates of respiration (0.44  0.03 g CO m log surface h), followed by the clearcut logs (0.36  0.02 g CO m log surface h), and spruce stand logs (0.30  0.02 g CO m log surface h) (P < 0.01). The boost in respiration found in the transfer treatment group was best explained by increases in log water content, while the slower rate of respiration in the spruce stand logs was best explained by the log's contact/non-contact with the ground prior to the start of the observational campaign. CWD respiration was found to represent 18  3 % of total daytime ecosystem respiration (Reco).
1469781|Riparian zones have long been considered as nitrate sinks in landscapes. Yet, riparian zones are also known to be very productive ecosystems with a high rate of nitrogen cycling. A key factor regulating processes in the N cycle in these zones is groundwater table fluctuation, which controls aerobic/anaerobic conditions in the soil. Nitrification and denitrification, key processes regulating plant productivity and nitrogen buffering capacities are strictly aerobic and anaerobic processes, respectively. In this study we compared the effects of these factors on the nitrogen cycling in riparian zones under different climatic conditions and N loading at the European scale. No significant differences in nitrification and denitrification rates were found either between climatic regions or between vegetation types. On the other hand, water table elevation turned out to be the prime determinant of the N dynamics and its end product. Three consistent water table thresholds were identified. In sites where the water table level is within -10 cm of the soil surface, ammonification is the main process and ammonium accumulates in the topsoils. Average water tables between -10 and -30 cm favour denitrification and therefore reduce the nitrogen availability in soils. In drier sites, that is, water table level below -30 cm, nitrate accumulates as a result of high net nitrification. At these latter sites, denitrification only occurs in fine textured soils probably triggered by rainfall events. Such a threshold could be used to provide a proxy to translate the consequences of stream flow regime change to nitrogen cycling in riparian zones and consequently, to potential changes in nitrogen mitigation.

24716786|Assessment of temporal trends and rates of change in hydrochemical parameters and forest cover has been conducted to elucidate key drivers of surface water acidification in glacial lakes in the Czech Republic. Since 1984, the key driver in acidification reversal was sulphate (SO) concentration (median decrease of 3.58 eq L yr) which fell in line with reductions in sulphur (S) deposition. Reduction of nitrogen (N) deposition was followed by proportional reduction in nitrate (NO) leaching although decline in NO concentrations was more pronounced at two sites, the ertovo Lake (CT) and Prilsk Lake (PR) until 2006; only d'rsk pond showed effective catchment N immobilization. Coherent decline of chloride concentration was detected across all sites. The decrease of strong mineral acids was partly compensated by decrease of inorganic aluminium (ALin), especially at sites most acidified in the beginning of observations (ANC19841986 between 160 and 90 eq L at CT, ern LakeCN and Plen lakePL) and by reductions of base cations and increases of pH. All lakes (CN, CT, PL, PR and LK) moved to the ANC range between 29 and 30 eq L (20102012) where sensitivity of pH to further reductions in acid anions may be expected. Concurrently, charge of weak organic acids (OAs) increased and partly balanced the strong mineral acid decrease as a consequence of (i) significant DOC (dissolved organic carbon) increase (median change of 0.13 mgC L yr since 1993) and (ii) deprotonation of weak OAs caused by pH rise. Since 2000s, bark beetle induced forest decline accelerated NO leaching at most of the catchments (by 200 % at LK, PL and PR). However, elevated N leaching was effectively neutralized by base cations (K, Mg, Ca) originating from decaying fresh litter, thus acidification recovery was not reversed, but slowed down. After cessation of NO leaching we hypothesise that collapsed tree canopy across catchments (from 12 to 87 % compared to 1984) will cause lower total acid input in precipitation (S + N) and regrowth of vegetation may stimulate higher N immobilization (in biomass and soil); processes which could lead to further increase of ANC and pH, key indicators for biological recovery.
1469973|In nutrient-poor ecosystems high polyphenol concentrations in plant litter have been proposed to influence soil nutrient availability in benefit of the plants. We addressed the question whether litter polyphenol concentrations vary across a soil chronosequence of almost identical geology, climate and plant species composition, but of a wide range in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability in the Hawaiian Islands. Concentrations of total phenolics (TPh) and proanthocyanidins (PA) in leaf litter of the dominant tree species Metrosideros polymorpha were higher at the oldest, P-limited site compared to the youngest, N-limited site, with intermediate values at the two relatively fertile sites co-limited by N and P. Polyphenol concentrations in fine root litter differed considerably from those observed in leaf litter and varied differently across the soil age gradient. Long-term fertilization did not significantly alter polyphenol concentrations in Metrosideros litter at either site. Moreover, green leaves and leaf litter of Metrosideros showed similar relative differences among sites when compared between natural populations and plants from the same populations but grown in a common garden. These results suggest that polyphenol concentrations inherently vary among populations of the dominant tree species in Hawaiian montane forests possibly indicating an adaptation to ecosystem properties such as substrate age related differences in soil fertility. The combined above- and below-ground input rate of TPh ranged from 62.4 to 170.8 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr and was significantly higher at the P-limited than at the N-limited site. Root-derived polyphenols contributed a much higher absolute and relative amount of phenolic input at the N-limited than at the P-limited site. The differences in amount, quality, and pathways of input might suggest specific interactions with soil processes and nutrient cycling among the Hawaiian rainforests studied here.
4151493|Soil organic matter (SOM) is the largest terrestrial C pool, and retention and release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) cause formation and loss of SOM. However, we lack information on how different sources of DOM affect its chemical composition, and how DOM chemical composition affects retention. We studied seasonal controls on DOM production and chemical controls on retention in soils of a temperate coniferous forest. The O horizon was not usually the dominant source for dissolved organic C (DOC) or N (DON) as has been reported for other sites. Rather, net production of both DOC and DON was often greater in the shallow mineral soil (0-10 cm) than in the O horizon. DOM production in the shallow mineral soil may be from root exudation as well as turnover of fine roots and microflora in the rhizosphere. In the field, the two acid fractions (hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids) dominated the soil solution at all depths. A major portion of net production and removal of total DOC within the soil column was explained by increases and decreases in these fractions, although a shift in chemical composition of DOM between the O and mineral soil horizons suggested different origins of DOM in these layers. A larger loss of the free amino fraction to deep soil water at this study site than at other sites suggested lower retention of labile DON. Field DOM removal measurements suggest that field-measured parameters may provide a good estimate for total DOM retained in mineral soil.
24715327|Soil salinity and fluctuations in soil matric potential are stressors for soil microorganisms which, in turn, may affect soil organic matter turnover. In response to salinity and low soil water content, many microorganisms accumulate osmolytes. Therefore, it is conceivable that microorganisms in saline soils are more tolerant to drying and rewetting (DRW) stress than those in non-saline soils. An experiment was carried out with three different salinity levels: electrical conductivity (EC1:5) 0, 2 and 4 dS m EC0, EC2, EC4), and two water treatments: a constantly moist control or two DRW cycles. Respiration as an indicator of microbial activity was measured throughout the 59 days of incubation. At the end of the second dry period (day 35) and at the end of the following moist incubation (day 59), microbial biomass and microbial community structure were determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Increasing salinity decreased microbial activity but did not affect its resistance to DRW. On day 59, cumulative respiration decreased in the order EC0 > EC2 > EC4 with no differences between water treatments. Fungal biomass was negatively affected by salinity at the end of the experiment, while bacterial biomass was unaffected. Microbial community structure in moist treatments differed between salinity levels, with EC4 influencing microbial community structure earlier than EC2. The resistance of microbial communities to DRW stress was salt level dependent; only beyond a critical salinity level adaptation to salt stress was able to reduce the impact of water stress on microbial community structure.
1469226|We present estimates of total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes in rivers to the North Atlantic Ocean from 14 regions in North America, South America, Europe, and Africa which collectively comprise the drainage basins to the North Atlantic. The Amazon basin dominates the overall phosphorus flux and has the highest phosphorus flux per area. The total nitrogen flux from the Amazon is also large, contributing 3.3 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> out of a total for the entire North Atlantic region of 13.1 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup>. On a per area basis, however, the largest nitrogen fluxes are found in the highly disturbed watersheds around the North Sea, in northwestern Europe, and in the northeastern U.S., all of which have riverine nitrogen fluxes greater than 1,000 kg N km<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Non-point sources of nitrogen dominate riverine fluxes to the coast in all regions. River fluxes of total nitrogen from the temperate regions of the North Atlantic basin are correlated with population density, as has been observed previously for fluxes of nitrate in the world's major rivers. However, more striking is a strong linear correlation between river fluxes of total nitrogen and the sum of anthropogenically-derived nitrogen inputs to the temperate regions (fertilizer application, human-induced increases in atmospheric deposition of oxidized forms of nitrogen, fixation by leguminous crops, and the import/export of nitrogen in agricultural products). On average, regional nitrogen fluxes in rivers are only 25% of these anthropogenically derived nitrogen inputs. Denitrification in wetlands and aquatic ecosystems is probably the dominant sink, with storage in forests perhaps also of importance. Storage of nitrogen in groundwater, although of importance in some localities, is a very small sink for nitrogen inputs in all regions. Agricultural sources of nitrogen dominate inputs in many regions, particularly the Mississippi basin and the North Sea drainages. Deposition of oxidized nitrogen, primarily of industrial origin, is the major control over river nitrogen export in some regions such as the northeastern U.S. Using data from relatively pristine areas as an index of change, we estimate that riverine nitrogen fluxes in many of the temperate regions have increased from pre-industrial times by 2 to 20 fold, although some regions such as northern Canada are relatively unchanged. Fluxes from the most disturbed region, the North Sea drainages, have increased by 6 to 20 fold. Fluxes from the Amazon basin are also at least 2 to 5 fold greater than estimated fluxes from undisturbed temperate-zone regions, despite low population density and low inputs of anthropogenic nitrogen to the region. This suggests that natural riverine nitrogen fluxes in the tropics may be significantly greater than in the temperate zone. However, deforestation may be contributing to the tropical fluxes. In either case, projected increases in fertilizer use and atmospheric deposition in the coming decades are likely to cause dramatic increases in nitrogen loading to many tropical river systems.
20456545|We examined total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) loading to a small forested stream during storm events. We hypothesized that upper soil and litter layers in riparian area are primary source of higher TKN concentrations during storm. A storm water sampling program was carried out to gather requisite flow and water quality data to calibrate and validate water and nutrient components of the Riparian Ecosystem Management Model for TKN. Water quality and storm flow data collected from January 2000 to December 2003 were used to simulate the hydrology and nitrogen transport over a second-order watershed within the Fort Benning Military Installation, Georgia. Intensive sampling conducted from October 2002 to May 2003 provided the necessary data to characterize the rising limb, peak, and recession limb of six major storm events. Simulated runoff and storm TKN loads were compared with their corresponding observed or calculated values. Hydrology and nitrogen data collected from February 21, 2003 to December 31, 2003 were used for the model validation. The hydrology component of the model showed a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 87% for the validation period. The average absolute difference between simulated and calculated TKN loads was 25%. Even though the monthly water budget indicated the dominance of subsurface flow, TKN contribution from direct runoff was significantly greater than that from subsurface flow. On an average, 73% of the observed total TKN load at the watershed outlet was contributed by surface runoff during storm events. The results suggested that the surface runoff during the storm events washed off the nitrogen from the forest floor and transported to the stream.
41490550|Potential disparities between rates of surface and below-ground respiration were examined in seven mangrove forests of different topographic height in Timor Leste. Differences in surface respiration between air-exposed and inundated soils were inconsistent, but surface respiration rates increased, with tidal elevation. Net primary production (NPP) on air-exposed soils declined with increasing forest cover indicating light limitation beneath the canopy. NPP and respiration were linearly related under both air-exposed and inundated conditions. Rates of DIC release from the soil surface varied among forests, correlating only with soil carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) and their stoichiometric ratios. Sulfate reduction was detected to maximum depth of unconsolidated soil, correlating only with TOC and TN content at discrete depth intervals. DIC concentrations in drainage channels were equivalent to porewater concentrations. The rate of carbon mineralized by sulfate reducers (SRC) was equivalent to rates of total carbon oxidation (TCO) measured at the soil surface in forests at tidal heights 0.5 m above mean sea-level (MSL). However, SRC was increasingly greater than TCO in forests residing from 1.0 up to 2.5 m above MSL. Most carbon mineralized in subsurface deposits appears to seep out of the forest via groundwater. Rates of surface respiration therefore underestimate rates of total benthic carbon mineralization in forests at topographic heights 0.5 m above MSL, suggesting that the amount of respiratory carbon exported from many mangrove forests has also been underestimated.
24715329|Strong correlations of soil total organic carbon (OC) with iron and aluminum phases reported frequently make it important to quantify these organic matter (OM) associations, but selective extractants sometimes contain OC. Soil nitrogen is often predominantly organic and might serve as a proxy for OM. We therefore investigated nitrogen associations with Fe and Al using several selective extractants that use reductive, complexation, and alkaline approaches. Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) correlated strongly with extracted Fe and Al across seventeen samples, including highly- and weakly-weathered soils, ironrich ultrabasic soils, podzolic, and volcanic soils. Typically a quarter to a third of total soil nitrogen was dissolved by the various extractions, though higher fractions (up to 60%) were found in spodic-horizon and volcanic surface-horizon samples. Similar proportions were found for OC, using three OC-free extractants, indicating that TDN provides a useful surrogate for assessing OM partitioning via extractants that contain OC. Use of TDN:metal ratios in extractant solutions allows estimation of extracted OM that could have been sorptively associated with metal oxide/hydroxides and poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates. These ratios were often high in extractions targeted at these adsorbents, and imply that usually most of the extracted TDN consists instead of organometal complexes. The dynamics of these complexes may have stronger control on accumulation/remobilization of soil OM than those of metal oxyhydroxides and poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates.
1468838|An analysis of data compiled from the literature confirms a strong inverse relationship between annual rates of nitrogen fixation and the soil nitrogen content in agricultural and pastoral ecosystems. However, this inverse relationship is strongly modified by the rate of application of phosphorus fertilizer, which strongly influences the activities of both symbiotic and non-symbiotic nitrogen fixing organisms. In the case of symbiotic legumes, the response of N-fixation to N and P is in part a result of changes in legume dominance within the plant community. These results, as well as supporting data presented from a review of experiments on nitrogen fixation in a variety of other terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, provide important support for the hypothesis that phosphorus availability is a key regulator of nitrogen biogeochemistry.
1469808| The effects of fluff deposit on benthic biota, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> fluxes and nitrification was studied in the laboratory using waterlogged and reflooded intertidal sediments from Marennes-Olron Bay, France. The fluff deposit was enriched in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> compared to underlying sediments, and promoted changes of the sediment pH, E<sub>h</sub>, C:N ratio, C:chl a ratio and the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> efflux to overlying water. Statistical analysis showed that pore water NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations were strongly influenced by interactions between fluff, drying, depth and bioturbation. The fluff deposit resulted in anoxia in the top sediments and moved the nitrification zone to surface layers in fluff. However, the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> enrichment in fluff did not significantly change actual nitrification rates (range 0-1 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) or potential nitrification rates (range 3-11 mmol NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). 
24715094|Nitrogen oxides (NO) are important components of ambient and indoor air pollution and are emitted from a range of combustion sources, including on-road mobile sources, electric power generators, and non-road mobile sources. While anthropogenic sources dominate, NO is also formed by lightning strikes and wildland fires and is also emitted by soil. Reduced nitrogen (e.g., ammonia, NH) is also emitted by various sources, including fertilizer application and animal waste decomposition. Nitrogen oxides, ozone (O) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution related to atmospheric emissions of nitrogen (N) and other pollutants can cause premature death and a variety of serious health effects. Climate change is expected to impact how N-related pollutants affect human health. For example, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are projected to both lengthen the O season and intensify high O episodes in some areas. Other climate-related changes may increase the atmospheric release of N compounds through impacts on wildfire regimes, soil emissions, and biogenic emissions from terrestrial ecosystems. This paper examines the potential human health implications of climate change and N cycle interactions related to ambient air pollution.
1469449|This study examined the concentration of organic and inorganic phosphorus in surface soils of a Bouteloua gracilis-Bouteloua eriopoda grassland, and a Larrea tridentata shrubland, in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico, USA. In this desert where the grassland vegetation has a uniform spatial distribution and individual shrubs have a patchy spatial distribution across the landscape, vegetation strongly influences the distribution of soil nutrients. Most studies of soil phosphorus fractions in desert soils have focused primarily on inorganic P fractions and have demonstrated the importance of geochemical controls on soil P cycling. The research presented here addressed the question of whether organic phosphorus, determined by the presence of different vegetation types, also contributes to soil P cycling. Within soils of similar age, topography, parent material, and climatic regime, samples were collected under and between vegetation and analyzed for P fractions following a modified sequential fractionation scheme. Most soil inorganic P was found in the HCl- and cHCl-extractable forms in both the grassland and shrubland soils, indicating CaCO<sub>3</sub> control over phosphorus availability. In contrast, most soil organic P was bound to Al and Fe minerals. Labile, plant-available P fractions summed to 9.5% of total P in the grassland and 6.1% in the shrubland. Organic P comprised 13.3% of the total phosphorus pool in the grassland and 12.0% in the shrubland. Our results show that the organic P pool may represent an important, yet often overlooked, source of P in semiarid ecosystems.
41490541|Microbial communities can potentially mediate feedbacks between global change and ecosystem function, owing to their sensitivity to environmental change and their control over critical biogeochemical processes. Numerous ecosystem models have been developed to predict global change effects, but most do not consider microbial mechanisms in detail. In this idea paper, we examine the extent to which incorporation of microbial ecology into ecosystem models improves predictions of carbon (C) dynamics under warming, changes in precipitation regime, and anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment. We focus on three cases in which this approach might be especially valuable: temporal dynamics in microbial responses to environmental change, variation in ecological function within microbial communities, and N effects on microbial activity. Four microbially-based models have addressed these scenarios. In each case, predictions of the microbial-based models differsometimes substantiallyfrom comparable conventional models. However, validation and parameterization of model performance is challenging. We recommend that the development of microbial-based models must occur in conjunction with the development of theoretical frameworks that predict the temporal responses of microbial communities, the phylogenetic distribution of microbial functions, and the response of microbes to N enrichment.
1468733|The dynamics of sulfur immobilization and mineralization in soil were simulated to test hypotheses about their regulation by the availability of carbon and nitrogen. The concept of chemical bond classes was incorporated into the model to account for variation in composition of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur compounds. Microbial biomass was differentiated into bacteria and fungi, and the element ratios of both groups were assumed to vary. Organic residues were divided between dead microbes plus microbial products, and the more labile fraction of stabilized soil organic matter. Concepts and hypotheses in the model were tested by applying it to data on microbial biomass, sulfate, nitrate, and CO<sub>2</sub> evolution obtained in laboratory incubations of two soils amended with sulfate and cellulose. An important mechanism of regulation tested in the model was the stimulation of sulfohydrolase enzyme production depending on sulfur stress in microbial biomass. The hypothesis that excess sulfate is stored as ester sulfate was supported by model dynamics.
24716789|Climate change is predicted to cause an increase in frequency and severity of droughts in the boreal ecozone, which can result in the lowering of water tables and subsequent release of acidic, metal-contaminated waters from wetlands. We believe that in areas where historical deposition of metals and sulphur was severe, these episodic pulses of metals could reach concentrations sufficiently high to severely affect aquatic communities in receiving waters and cause a delay in biological recovery. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of drought on the chemistry of water draining from two Sudbury peatlands with widely contrasting peat organic matter content to determine the response of stream water chemistry to drought from peatland types in the region. Stream samples were collected using ISCO automated water collectors from June to November 2011. Following a period of drought, there was a decline in pH and a large increase in concentrations of sulphate and metal ions (Al, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in water draining both peatlands, with extreme concentrations occurring over a period of about two weeks. At the site with the higher peat organic matter content there was an increase in metals that have a high affinity to bind to DOC (Al, Cu, and Fe) during the onset of drought. This study demonstrates a dramatic response to drought at two sites that differ in metal and nutrient pool sizes, hydrology, and topography, suggesting the potential for a majority of peatlands in the region to experience this response. Efforts to restore aquatic ecosystems and protect freshwater resources must take into account these processes, as disruptions to biogeochemical cycles are likely to become more prevalent in a changing climate.
41490452|Wetland ecosystems in agricultural areas often become progressively more isolated from main water bodies. Stagnation favors the accumulation of organic matter as the supply of electron acceptors with water renewal is limited. In this context it is expected that nitrogen recycling prevails over nitrogen dissipation. To test this hypothesis, denitrification rates, fluxes of dissolved oxygen (SOD), inorganic carbon (DIC) and nitrogen and sediment features were measured in winter and summer 2007 on 22 shallow riverine wetlands in the Po River Plain (Northern Italy). Fluxes were determined from incubations of intact cores by measurement of concentration changes or isotope pairing in the case of denitrification. Sampled sites were eutrophic to hypertrophie; 10 were connected and 12 were isolated from the adjacent rivers, resulting in large differences in nitrate concentrations in the water column (from < 5 to 1,133 M). Benthic metabolism and denitrification rates were investigated by two overarching factors: season and hydrological connectivity. SOD and DIC fluxes resulted in respiratory quotients greater than one at most sampling sites. Sediment respiration was coupled to both ammonium efflux, which increased from winter to summer, and nitrate consumption, with higher rates in river-connected wetlands. Denitrification rates measured in river-connected wetlands (35-1,888 mol N m h) were up to two orders of magnitude higher than rates measured in isolated wetlands (2-231 mol N m h), suggesting a strong regulation of the process by nitrate availability. These rates were also significantly higher in summer (9-1,888 mol N m h) than in winter (2-365 mol N m h). Denitrification supported by water column nitrate (D w ) accounted for 60-100% of total denitrification (Dtot); denitrification coupled to nitrification (D N ) was probably controlled by limited oxygen availability within sediments. Denitrification efficiency, calculated as the ratio between N removal via denitrification and N regeneration, and the relative role of denitrification for organic matter oxidation, were high in connected wetlands but not in isolated sites. This study confirms the importance of restoring hydraulic connectivity of riverine wetlands for the maintenance of important biogeochemical functions such as nitrogen removal via denitrification.
20456486|The phytoplankton genus Phaeocystis has well-documented, spatially and temporally extensive blooms of gelatinous colonies; these are associated with release of copious amounts of dimethyl sulphide (an important climate-cooling aerosol) and alterations of material flows among trophic levels and export from the upper ocean. A potentially salient property of the importance of Phaeocystis in the marine ecosystem is its physiological capability to transform between solitary cell and gelatinous colonial life cycle stages, a process that changes organism biovolume by 6-9 orders of magnitude, and which appears to be activated or stimulated under certain circumstances by chemical communication. Both life-cycle stages can exhibit rapid, phased ultradian growth. The colony skin apparently confers protection against, or at least reduces losses to, smaller zooplankton grazers and perhaps viruses. There are indications that Phaeocystis utilizes chemistry and/or changes in size as defenses against predation, and its ability to create refuges from biological attack is known to stabilize predator--prey dynamics in model systems. Thus the life cycle form in which it occurs, and particularly associated interactions with viruses, determines whether Phaeocystis production flows through the traditional "great fisheries" food chain, the more regenerative microbial food web, or is exported from the mixed layer of the ocean. Despite this plethora of information regarding the physiological ecology of Phaeocystis, fundamental interactions between life history traits and system ecology are poorly understood. Research summarized here, and described in the various papers in this special issue, derives from a central question: how do physical (light, temperature, particle distributions, hydrodynamics), chemical (nutrient resources, infochemistry, allelopathy), biological (grazers, viruses, bacteria, other phytoplankton), and self-organizational mechanisms (stability, indirect effects) interact with life-cycle transformations of Phaeocystis to mediate ecosystem patterns of trophic structure, biodiversity, and biogeochemical fluxes? Ultimately the goal is to understand and thus predict why Phaeocystis occurs when and where it does, and the bio-feedbacks between this keystone species and the multitrophic level ecosystem.
41490421|The effect of phototrophic biofilm activity on advective transport of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) in sandy sediments was examined using percolated columns. Cd and Ni in the effluent exhibited clear diel cycles in biofilmcontaining columns, with concentrations at the end of dark periods exceeding those during illumination by up to 4.5-and 10-fold for Ni and Cd, respectively. Similar cycles were not observed for Pb or Cu. Breakthrough of the latter metals was greatly retarded and incomplete relative to Cd and Ni, and trends in biofilm treatments did not differ greatly from those in control columns. Inhibition of photosystem II by DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1 -dimethylurea) proved that diel cycles of Cd and Ni were controlled by oxygenic photosynthesis, and microsensor measurements showed that metal cycles closely matched metabolic activity-driven pH variations. The sorption edge pH for the sand/biofilm substrate followed the order Ni > Cd > Cu > Pb, and for Ni and Cd, was within the pH 710 range observed in the biofilmcontaining column. Adsorption dynamics over the light periods matched pH increases, but desorption during dark periods was incomplete and slower than the rate of change of pH. Over a diel cycle, desorption was less than adsorption, resulting in net binding of dissolved metals due to the biofilm metabolic activity. Extraction with selective reagents indicated that the adsorbed metals were readily exchangeable, and potentially bioavailable. Thus, phototrophic benthic biofilms can control the transport of some metals across the sandwater interface, and processes in this very thin surficial layer should be considered when evaluating chemical fluxes in permeable sediments.
20055160|We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the impact of changing agricultural land use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage under moist and dry climatic conditions of temperate and tropical regions. We derived estimates of management impacts for a carbon accounting approach developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, addressing the impact of long-term cultivation, setting-aside land from crop production, changing tillage management, and modifying C input to the soil by varying cropping practices. We found 126 articles that met our criteria and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. In general, management impacts were sensitive to climate in the following order from largest to smallest changes in SOC: tropical moist &gt tropical dry &gt temperate moist &gt temperate dry. For example, long-term cultivation caused the greatest loss of SOC in tropical moist climates, with cultivated soils having 0.58  0.12, or 58% of the amount found under native vegetation, followed by tropical dry climates with 0.69  0.13, temperate moist with 0.71  0.04, and temperate dry with 0.82  0.04. Similarly, converting from conventional tillage to no-till increased SOC storage over 20 years by a factor of 1.23  0.05 in tropical moist climates, which is a 23% increase in SOC, while the corresponding change in tropical dry climates was 1.17  0.05, temperate moist was 1.16  0.02, and temperate dry was 1.10  0.03. These results demonstrate that agricultural management impacts on SOC storage will vary depending on climatic conditions that influence the plant and soil processes driving soil organic matter dynamics.
1468746|In anoxic salt marsh sediments of Sapelo Island, GA, USA, the vertical distribution of CH<sub>4</sub> production was measured in the upper 20 cm of surface sediments in ten locations. In one section of high marsh sediments, the concentration and oxidation of acetate in sediment porewaters and the rate and amount of <sup>14</sup>C acetate and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> incorporation into cellular lipids of the microbial population were investigated. CH<sub>4</sub> production rates ranged from <1 to 493 nM CH<sub>4</sub> gram sediment<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> from intact subcores incubated under nitrogen. Replacement with H<sub>2</sub> stimulated the rate of methane release up to nine fold relative to N<sub>2</sub> incubations. Rates of lipid synthesis from CO<sub>2</sub> averaged 39.2 10<sup>-2</sup> nanomoles lipid carbon cm<sup>3</sup> sediment<sup>-1</sup> hr<sup>-1</sup>, suggesting that CO<sub>2</sub> may be an important carbon precursor for microbial membrane synthesis in marsh sediments under anoxic conditions. Qualitative measurements of lipid synthesis rates from acetate were found to average 8.7 10<sup>-2</sup> nanomoles. Phospholipids were the dominant lipids synthesized by both substrates in sediment cores, accounting for an average of 76.6% of all lipid radioactivity. Small amounts of ether lipids indicative of methanogenic bacteria were observed in cores incubated for 7 days, with similar rates of synthesis for both CO<sub>2</sub> and acetate. The low rate of ether lipid synthesis suggests that either methanogen lipid biosynthesis is very slow or that methanogens represent a small component of total microbial lipid synthesis in anoxic sediments.
1469250|We measured ammonia volatilization at three topographic positions (hilltop, mid-slope, slope-bottom) on three grassland landscapes at three times during 1995 (April, May, July) on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park that supports large herds of native ungulates. Percent ammonia-N lost from all sites during the study ranged 1-24% of urea-N applied. Volatilization among sites was negatively related to soil cation-exchange capacity (r = -0.85) and rates were highest in July. We used the relationship between soil CEC and percent N volatilized from urea-amended plots to estimate annual ammonia-N volatilization from 5 sites for which annual ungulate urine inputs were previously determined (Frank et al. 1994). Estimated mean annual ammonia-N volatilized from those sites was 1.4 kg/ha/yr, which was less than a previously reported regional atmospheric deposition rate (2 kg/ha/yr; Swank 1984). Results indicate the need to understand the interaction between (1) spatially heterogeneous patterns of soil processes, and 2) nonuniform patterns of ungulate use of landscapes to determine rates of ecosystem-level N-gaseous loss. Findings also suggest that ammonia-N volatilized from urine patches should not lead to a decline in soil N in this ecosystem.
41410597|Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition increasingly impacts remote ecosystems. At high altitudes, snow is a key carrier of water and nutrients from the atmosphere to the soil. Medium-sized subalpine grassland terraces are characteristic of agricultural landscapes in the French Alps and influence spatial and temporal snow pack variables. At the Lautaret Pass, we investigated snow and soil characteristics along mesotopographic gradients across the terraces before and during snowmelt. Total N concentrations in the snowpack did not vary spatially and were dominated by organic N forms either brought by dry deposition trapped by the snow, or due to snowmicrobial immobilization and turnover. As expected, snowpack depth, total N deposited with snow and snowmelt followed the terrace toposequence; more snow-N accumulated towards the bank over longer periods. However, direct effects of snow-N on soil-N cycling seem unlikely since the amount of nitrogen released into the soil from the snowpack was very small relative to soil-N pools and N mineralization rates. Nevertheless, some snow-N reached the soil at thaw where it underwent biotic and abiotic processes. In situ soil-N mineralization rates did not vary along the terrace toposequence but soil-N cycling was indirectly affected by the snowpack. Indeed, N mineralization responded to the snowmelt dynamic via induced temporal changes in soil characteristics (i.e. moisture and T) which cascaded down to affect N-related microbial activities and soil pH. Soil-NH and DON accumulated towards the bank during snowmelt while soil-NO followed a pulse-release pattern. At the end of the snowmelt season, organic substrate limitation might be accountable for the decrease in N mineralization in general, and in $NH_4^ + $ production in particular. Possibly, during snowmelt, other biotic or abiotic processes (nitrification, denitrification, plant uptake, leaching) were involved in the transformation and transfer of snow and soil-N pools. Finally, subalpine soils at the Lautaret Pass during snowmelt experienced strong biotic and abiotic changes and switched between a source and a sink of N.
24715118|Sources and distribution of particulate organic matter in surface waters of the Humber and Thames estuaries and in the East Anglian plume in the southern North Sea were investigated in winter 2006/2007. Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes provided evidence for the presence of three particulate organic matter sources; riverine plankton C 30  and N 7.9 ) identified in the Thames estuary only, marine plankton (average C 21.4  N 4.5 ) and a third source with an enriched C signature (>16.7 ) and elevated C:N ratio (>12.7). Particulate organic matter with enriched C values were observed throughout the Humber estuary and at the marine end-member of the Thames estuary. While bacterial cycling of organic carbon undoubtedly takes place within these estuaries, these processes on their own are unlikely to account for the isotopic signatures seen. The C enriched organic matter source is suggested to be due to particulate organic matter input from marsh plants and seagrasses such as Spartina spp. and Zostera on the adjacent salt marshes and mudflats and/or macroalgae along the banks of the estuaries. This C enriched signal was also identified approximately 50 km offshore within the southern North Sea, in the East Anglian plume, which transports UK riverine water off-shore in a discrete plume. This plume therefore provides a mechanism to transport this estuarine derived organic matter pool offshore out of the estuaries. These results indicate that estuarine derived organic matter from marsh plants, seagrasses and/or macroalgae contributes to the southern North Sea organic matter pool and is therefore likely to contribute to winter-time shelf sea carbon and nitrogen cycles.
1468489|A simple view of the role of rooted macrophytes in element cycling sees them as pumps retrieving buried elements from the sediment profile. To investigate the relationship between the elemental composition of plants and sediments, we analysed published data for 39 elements. The best general model explained 84% of the variance of the log of plant element concentration: LPE = - 0.81 + 0.90 Log Sediment Element (ug/g dry wt.) - 0.12 Sediment Organic Content (ug/g drt wt.) + 0.67 Atomic radius (nm) (r<sup>2</sup>=0.84; n=39) This close relationship between the concentrations of an element in plant tissues and in the underlying sediment indicates that acquatic plants do not differ markedly in element composition from the sediments in which they grow. T-tests between mean residuals indicated that these aquatic plants do not discriminate between essential and nonessential elements. Model II regression analyses showed no difference between the slopes of the functional relationships for individual elements and that of the general model. When the elements were separated into three groups (alkali, transition and related metals, and halogens), Log Sediment Element accounted for 75-96% of the variation in LPE. Element physicochemical parameters were also significant independent variables explaining an additional 3-12% variation in LPE. The relative importance of the independent variables differed for the three groups of elements.
1469951|The rates and pathways of anaerobic carbon mineralization processes were investigated at seven stations, ranging from 10 to 56 m water depth, in the Kattegat and Belt Sea, Denmark. Organic carbon mineralization coupled to microbial Mn and Fe reduction was quantified using anaerobic sediment incubation at two stations that were widely separated geographically within the study area. Fe reduction accounted for 75% of the anaerobic carbon oxidation at the station in the northern Kattegat, which is the highest percentage so far reported from subtidal marine sediment. By contrast, sulfate reduction was the dominant anaerobic respiration pathway (95%) at the station in the Great Belt. Dominance of Fe reduction was related to a relatively high sediment Fe content in combination with active reworking of the sediment by infauna. The relative contribution of Fe reduction to anaerobic carbon oxidation at both stations correlated with the concentration of poorly crystalline Fe(III), confirming that the concentration of poorly crystalline Fe(III) exerts a strong control on rates of Fe reduction in marine sediments. The dependence of microbial Fe reduction on concentrations of poorly crystalline Fe(III) was used to quantify the importance of Fe reduction at sites where anaerobic incubations were not applied. This study showed that Fe reduction is an important process in anaerobic carbon oxidation in a wider area of the seafloor in the northern and eastern Kattegat (contribution 60 - 75%). By contrast, Fe reduction is of little significance (6 - 25%) in the more coarse-grained sediments of the shallower western and southern Kattegat, where a low Fe content was an important limiting factor, and in fine-grained sediments of the Belt Sea (4 - 28%), where seasonal oxygen depletion limits the intensity of bioturbation and thereby the availability of Fe(III). A large fraction of the total deposition of organic matter in the Kattegat and Belt Sea occurs in the northern Kattegat, and we estimate 33% of benthic carbon oxidation in the whole area is conveyed by Fe reduction.
1469706|Several ecosystems in the western US are already undergoing nitrogen (N) saturation, a condition where previously N limited ecosystems are no longer N limited. This state of N saturation leads to adverse impacts on terrestrial ecology and water quality. Due to the complexities of terrestrial carbon-nitrogen cycling, integrated hydrologic-biogeochemical modeling provides a tool to improve our understanding and discern between the impacts of changes in N deposition from changes in other ecosystem processes. A model of biogeochemical processing in alpine watersheds was developed and applied to the Emerald Lake watershed. Simulations of major terrestrial carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes were adequate. The use of snow cover information to estimate soil temperatures improved model simulations indicating that snow cover processes need to be incorporated into biogeochemical models of seasonally snow covered areas. The model simulated mineral nitrogen processes well but significant changes in denitrification and dissolved organic nitrogen export processes appear to be necessary. Our results also showed that variations in snow cover duration have more of an impact on mineral N export, plant uptake and mineralization than appears possible due to changes in atmospheric deposition.
24715146|We provide data on nutrient export for 28 rivers in southwestern Europe and analyze long-term changes in the context of anthropogenic pressures and regulation policies. Special attention is given to seasonal variations, because the integrated annual values that are usually provided do not allow us to establish comparisons with seasonal phytoplankton dynamics. The eutrophication risk associated with river inputs is addressed by means of an indicator (Index of Coastal Eutrophication Potential, ICEP, Billen and Garnier, Mar Chem 106:148160, 2007). An overview of the temporal evolution and the intra-annual variability of the ICEP is discussed for specific rivers and integrated coastal regions. The annual dynamics of the eutrophication indicator is analyzed to delimit those periods when the risk of eutrophication is particularly high. The trends in nutrient fluxes and coastal phytoplankton are compared by means of a case study (Seine Bay). The decrease in phosphorus matches a general decrease in phytoplankton biomass in the summer. However, sustained high values of nitrogen still foster the emergence of harmful algal blooms, and we found an increase in the summer abundance of dinoflagellates. The abatement of phosphorus alone is not enough to shortcut harmful blooms and toxic outbreaks in the Seine Bay. A reduction in nitrogen inputs may be necessary to effectively minimize eutrophication problems.
1469619|Deposition of suspended sediments and their associated nutrients were estimated during the flood event of 1995 in the seasonally flooded forests of the Mapire and Caura Rivers, two black-water tributaries of lower Orinoco, and on two islands of this white-water river. The deposition spanned a wide range from 0.07 kg m<sup>-2</sup> in the depositional bar forests of the Mapire River to 73.60 kg m<sup>-2</sup> on the flooded forests of the Orinoco Island site called Jarizo. This variation is associated with the dynamic nature of sediment mobilization, transport and deposition, as well as with the different geomorphic environments and erosion processes upstream from the study sites. The deposited sediment in all the study areas was highly quartzitic with a relatively high content of kaolinite and goethite. Only in the sediment of the Orinoco Islands was mica (illite) identified in a relatively high proportion. These mineralogical results reflect the intense weathering processes in the catchment areas of the study rivers. The chemical composition of the deposited sediments showed a great variability among the different study areas, which is in part related to the mineral composition of the sediments and their particle size distribution. The highest concentrations of K, Ca and Mg were found on the clay sediments of the Orinoco agricultural island. The total amount of deposited nutrients varied over a wide range, which is influenced by the amount of deposited sediments. In the Jarizo Island site of lower Orinoco were deposited the largest amount of nutrients. In the flooded forests of the Mapire River, the nutrient contribution by the deposited sediments to the nutrient cycling is relatively low in the depositional-bar forests and practically nonexistent in the forests sites on terraces.
40343556|The calcium (Ca) isotope system is potentially of great use for understanding biogeochemical processes at multiple scales in forest ecosystems, yet remains largely unexplored for this purpose. In order to further our understanding of Ca behavior in forests, we examined two nearly adjacent hardwood-dominated catchments with differing soil Ca concentrations, developed from crystalline bedrock, to determine the variability of Ca/Ca ratios (expressed as Ca) within soil and vegetation pools. For both sugar maple and American beech, the Ca isotope compositions of the measured roots and calculated bulk trees were considerably lighter than those of soil pools at these sites, suggesting that the trees were able to preferentially take up light Ca at the root-soil interface. The Ca isotope compositions of three of four root samples were among the lightest values yet reported for terrestrial materials (Ca -3.95. Our results further indicate that Ca isotopes were fractionated along the transpiration streams of both tree species with roots having the least Ca values and leaf litter the greatest. An approximately 2 difference in Ca values between roots and leaf litter of both tree species suggests a persistent fractionation mechanism along the transpiration stream, likely related to Ca binding in wood tissue coupled with internal ion exchange. Finally, our data indicate that differing tree species demand for Ca and soil Ca concentrations together may influence Ca isotope distribution within the trees. Intercatchment differences in Ca isotope distributions in soils and trees were minor, indicating that the results of our study may have broad transferability to studies of forest ecosystems in catchments developed on crystalline substrates elsewhere.
1468798|A small pond in southwestern peninsular Florida was sampled to determine the areal and depth distribution of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and organic matter. Concentrations of these constituents decreased from the center to the edge of the pond and from the top to the bottom of the sediments. At the center of the pond total phosphorus showed a secondary concentration peak at a depth of 20 to 40 cm in the sediments indicative of the downward transfer of soluble phosphorus during times of low water. A system of monitoring wells was installed at the pond to measure groundwater input and output nutrient concentrations. There was no difference in total groundwater nitrogen concentration across the pond but the mean increase in total phosphorus concentration between input and output wells, ca. 200  g l<sup>-1</sup>, was statistically highly significant. The results suggest that whereas nitrogen is recycled from sediments to the pond and the atmosphere, the pond-sediment system loses some phosphorus to groundwater throughflow.
41490477|Storm losses of N via tile-drainage in the US Midwest are a major concern for water quality in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB). This study investigates the impact of precipitation characteristics on NO, NH and DON concentrations and fluxes for spring storms in tile-drains in a Midwestern agricultural watershed. Bulk precipitation amount had little impact on solute median concentrations in tile-drains during storms, but clearly impacted Mg, K and NO concentration patterns. For large storms (>6 cm of bulk precipitation), large amounts of macropore flow (4350% of total tile-drain flow) diluted Mg and NO rich groundwater as discharge peaked. This pattern was not observed for NH and DON or for smaller tile-flow generating events (<3 cm) during which macropore flow contributions were limited (1117% of total tile-drain flow). Precipitation amount was positively (P < 0.01) correlated to NO and NH export rates, but not to DON export rates. Limited variations in antecedent water table depth in spring had little influence on N dynamics for the storms studied. Although significant differences in flow characteristics were observed between tile-drains, solute concentration dynamics and macropore flow contributions to total tile-drain flow were similar for adjacent tile-drains. Generally, NO represented >80% of N flux during storms, while DON and NH represented only 214% and 17% of N flux, respectively. This study stresses the non-linear behavior of N losses to tile drains during spring storms in artificially drained landscapes of the US Midwest, at a critical time of the year for N management in the MRB.
41410546|The annual fixation of dissolved Si (DSi) into terrestrial vegetation has been estimated to range from 60 to 200 Tmole, or 10-40 times more than the yearly export of DSi and biogenic Si (BSi) from the terrestrial geobiosphere to the coastal zone. Ecosystems form a large filter between primary mobilization of DSi from silicate weathering and its eventual export to the oceans, and a large reservoir of BSi accumulates in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Although a number of synthesis activities within the last decade have discussed biological transformations in the terrestrial Si cycle, the timescales at which BSi is stored and recycled within ecosystems, BSi persistence and reactivity throughout soil profiles, the dependence of the BSi storage and recycling on ecological processes, the feedbacks to hydrology, the interaction with man's activities and ultimately the global relevance in Si budgets are poorly constrained. Here we discuss 5 key controls on the ability of ecosystems to filter and control the export of DSi: ecosystem biodiversity, BSi dissolution rates and reactivity, hydrology, interaction with the geosphere and anthropogenic impacts. These controls need to be further studied to better quantify the global and local importance of the terrestrial biogeochemical Si cycle and specifically the BSi reservoir in ecosystems.
1469555|Forest soil respiration is the sum of heterotrophic (microbes, soil fauna) and autotrophic (root) respiration. The contribution of each group needs to be understood to evaluate implications of environmental change on soil carbon cycling and sequestration. Three primary methods have been used to distinguish hetero- versus autotrophic soil respiration including: integration of components contributing to in situ forest soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux (i.e., litter, roots, soil), comparison of soils with and without root exclusion, and application of stable or radioactive isotope methods. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, but isotope based methods provide quantitative answers with the least amount of disturbance to the soil and roots. Published data from all methods indicate that root/rhizosphere respiration can account for as little as 10 percent to greater than 90 percent of total in situ soil respiration depending on vegetation type and season of the year. Studies which have integrated percent root contribution to total soil respiration throughout an entire year or growing season show mean values of 45.8 and 60.4 percent for forest and nonforest vegetation, respectively. Such average annual values must be extrapolated with caution, however, because the root contribution to total soil respiration is commonly higher during the growing season and lower during the dormant periods of the year.
40343546|Human activities have altered riverine silica cycling and diminished the supply of silica to the oceans, but few rivers have been intensively monitored to evaluate the magnitude of these changes. In this study we measured dissolved silica (DSi) and amorphous silica (ASi) fluxes into and out of two large, culturally-impacted natural impoundments of the upper Mississippi River, Lakes St. Croix and Pepin, USA. ASi sedimentation rates and sedimentwater fluxes of DSi were calculated for each lake, and a mass-balance approach was used to determine in-lake ASi production. ASi from terrestrial phytoliths in the lake sediments was determined to be only partially available to biotic recycling, and in-lake ASi dissolution was small relative to the total silica budgets. The river reaches upstream of the two lakes were found to have abundant DSi, and riverine diatom production was found to contribute significant amounts of ASi to each lake. The average total phosphorus concentration in Lake Pepin is four times that in Lake St. Croix but ASi production in Lake Pepin is only 2.3 times higher than in Lake St. Croix, indicating that diatom growth in Pepin is limited by factors such as turbidity. Lake St. Croix currently traps about 10% of the inflowing total bioavailable silica (
1469022|We examined the 10-day response of soil microbial biomass-N to additions of carbon (dextrose) and nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) to water-amended soils in a factorial experiment in four plant communities of the Chihuahuan desert of New Mexico (U.S.A.). In each site, microbial biomass-N and soil carbohydrates increased and extractable soil N decreased in response to watering alone. Fertilization with N increased microbial biomass-N in grassland soils; whereas, fertilization with C increased microbial biomass-N and decreased extractable N and P in all communities dominated by shrubs, which have invaded large areas of grassland in the Chihuahuan desert during the last 100 years. Our results support the hypothesis that the control of soil microbial biomass shifts from N to C when the ratio of C to N decreases during desertification.
24715091|Agriculture in the United States (US) cycles large quantities of nitrogen (N) to produce food, fuel, and fiber and is a major source of excess reactive nitrogen (Nr) in the environment. Nitrogen lost from cropping systems and animal operations moves to waterways, groundwater, and the atmosphere. Changes in climate and climate variability may further affect the ability of agricultural systems to conserve N. The N that escapes affects climate directly through the emissions of nitrous oxide (NO), and indirectly through the loss of nitrate (NO), nitrogen oxides (NO) and ammonia to downstream and downwind ecosystems that then emit some of the N received as NO and NO. Emissions of NO lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas that can also harm crops directly. There are many opportunities to mitigate the impact of agricultural N on climate and the impact of climate on agricultural N. Some are available today; many need further research; and all await effective incentives to become adopted. Research needs can be grouped into four major categories: (1) an improved understanding of agricultural N cycle responses to changing climate; (2) a systems-level understanding of important crop and animal systems sufficient to identify key interactions and feedbacks; (3) the further development and testing of quantitative models capable of predicting N-climate interactions with confidence across a wide variety of crop-soil-climate combinations; and (4) socioecological research to better understand the incentives necessary to achieve meaningful deployment of realistic solutions.
1469551| The world's soils contain about 1500 Gt of organic carbon to a depth of 1m and a further 900 Gt from 1-2m. A change of total soil organic carbon by just 10% would thus be equivalent to all the anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emitted over 30 years. Warming is likely to increase both the rate of decomposition and net primary production (NPP), with a fraction of NPP forming new organic carbon. Evidence from various sources can be used to assess whether NPP or the rate of decomposition has the greater temperature sensitivity, and, hence, whether warming is likely to lead to an increase or decrease in soil organic carbon. Evidence is reviewed from laboratory-based incubations, field measurements of organic carbon storage, carbon isotope ratios and soil respiration with either naturally varying temperatures or after experimentally increasing soil temperatures. Estimates of terrestrial carbon stored at the Last Glacial Maximum are also reviewed. The review concludes that the temperature dependence of organic matter decomposition can be best described as: d(T) = exp[3.36 (T - 40)/(T + 31.79)] where d(T) is the normalised decomposition rate at temperature T (in C). In this equation, decomposition rate is normalised to '1' at 40 C. The review concludes by simulating the likely changes in soil organic carbon with warming. In summary, it appears likely that warming will have the effect of reducing soil organic carbon by stimulating decomposition rates more than NPP. However, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> is likely to simultaneously have the effect of increasing soil organic carbon through increases in NPP. Any changes are also likely to be very slow. The net effect of changes in soil organic carbon on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> loading over the next decades to centuries is, therefore, likely to be small. 
40343533|We studied concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO), methane (CH) and nitrous oxide (NO) in the eutrophic Temmesjoki River and Estuary in the Liminganlahti Bay in 20032004 and evaluated the atmospheric fluxes of the gases based on measured concentrations, wind speeds and water current velocities. The Temmesjoki River was a source of CO, CH and NO to the atmosphere, whereas the Liminganlahti Bay was a minor source of CH and a minor source or a sink of CO and NO. The results show that the fluxes of greenhouse gases in river ecosystems are highly related to the land use in its catchment areas. The most upstream river site, surrounded by forests and drained peatlands, released significant amounts of CO and CH, with average fluxes of 5,400 mg COC m d and 66 mg CHC m d, and concentrations of 210 M and 345 nM, respectively, but NO concentrations, at an average of 17 nM, were close to the atmospheric equilibrium concentration. The downstream river sites surrounded by agricultural soils released significant amounts of NO (with an average emission of 650 g NON m d and concentration of 22 nM), whereas the CO and CH concentrations were low compared to the upstream site (55 M and 350 nM). In boreal regions, rivers are partly icecovered in wintertime (approximately 5 months). A large part of the gases, i. e. 58% of CO, 55% of CH and 36% of NO emissions, were found to be released during wintertime from unfrozen parts of the river.

41490505|In a context of climate change peatlands may switch from a sink to a source of carbon (C). The induced positive feedbacks are closely linked to in the underlying peat. Our aims were to determine how moisture conditions in a Sphagnum-dominated peatland affect the dynamics of diagenetic sensitive OM which is thought to be the most reactive to warming effects. The approach was based on the identification of combined bulk and molecular bioindicators of OM sources and decay of peat profiles (up to 50 cm in depth) from two moisture conditions of the Le Forbonnet peatland (Jura Mountains, France). The (xylose + arabinose)/(galactose + rhamnose + mannose) ratio derived from the analysis of neutral monosaccharides was used to obtain indications on the botanical origin of the peat and tended to indicate a greater contribution of Cyperaceae in the deepest parts of the peat. Most bioindicators showed that OM decay increased with depth and was higher in the dynamics, and thus to the fate of organic driest conditions. In these conditions, decay was shown by a loss of diagenetic sensitive oxygen-rich OM, probably leached by water table fluctuations. Decay intensity was also shown by the high ribose and lyxose contents at the peat surface, where microscopic observations also revealed relatively large quantities of fungal hyphae. The sugars could have arisen from microbial synthesis, primarily protozoan and fungal activity. These results suggest that water level changes preferentially impact biochemical changes in diagenetic sensitive OM, believed to be sensitive to drought events.
40800613|Monitoring data over the period 19942007 were analysed for three streams (Cottage Hill Sike, CHS; Rough Sike, RS; Trout Beck, TB) draining blanket peat underlain by glacial clay and limestone-rich sub-strata at Moor House (Northern England). Dissolved organic carbon concentration, [DOC], showed complex relationships with both discharge and calcium concentration, [Ca]. A model based on [Ca] was constructed to simulate stream [DOC] by mixing dissolved organic matter (DOM) from shallow peat, quantified by measured [DOC] (1530 mg 1) in peat porewater, with DOM assumed to be present at a constant concentration (c. 5 mg 1) in groundwater. A temperature-based adjustment to the measured porewater [DOC] was required to account for relatively low streamwater [DOC] during winter and spring. The fitted model reproduced short-term variation in streamwater [DOC] satisfactorily, in particular variability in RS and TB due to groundwater contributions. Streamwater DOM is largely derived from surface peat, which accounts for more than 96% of the total DOC flux in both RS and TB, and 100% in CHS. Model outputs were combined with streamwater and porewater DO C data to estimate the C contents, and thereby the ages, of DOM from peat and groundwater. The peat-derived DOM is 5 years old on average, with most of it very recently formed. The derived age of groundwater DOM (8,500 years) is comparable to the 4,0007,000 years estimated from the DO C of water extracts of clay underlying the peat, suggesting that the clay is the source of groundwater DOM.

1469242|We measured respiration and  <sup>13</sup>C values of respired and soil carbon in long-term incubations of soils from two forests and three pastures along an altitudinal gradient in Hawaii. CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes early in the incubations decreased rapidly, and then stabilized at approximately 20% of initial values for seven months. We suggest that the rapid drop and subsequent stabilization of respiration reflects a change in the dominant source of the CO<sub>2</sub> from labile (active) to much more recalcitrant pools of soil organic matter (SOM). Estimates of active SOM were made by integrating all of the carbon respired in excess of that attributable to respiration of the intermediate SOM pool; these values ranged from 0.7-4.3% of total soil C.  <sup>13</sup>C values for carbon respired from the pasture soils showed that older, forest-derived C contributed an increasing fraction of total soil respiration with time. Initial and late-stage respiration responded similarly to changes in temperature, suggesting that intermediate SOM is as sensitive to temperature as the active fraction.
1469327|The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of sewage treatment on total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in domestic effluents and the contribution of urban sewage treatment facilities to THg and MeHg in rivers. We determined the concentrations of THg and MeHg in unfiltered samples of untreated and treated domestic sewage from the three treatment facilities and receiving river water within the City of Winnipeg. The concentrations of THg in the Red and Assiniboine rivers ranged from 3-31 ng/L. THg was related positively to suspended sediment concentrations in the rivers. The concentrations of MeHg in these rivers were usually 0.2-0.3 ng/L. THg concentrations in raw sewage varied widely, from 2-150 ng/L. Treatment removed an average of 88% of this mercury. MeHg concentrations in raw sewage were 0.5-4.3 ng/L, however, after treatment at two treatment facilities, MeHg was greatly reduced, usually to 0.1-0.4 ng/L. Most treated sewage, therefore, had MeHg concentrations that were similar to levels in the receiving rivers and the effect of discharged effluent was usually a change of about 2% or less on concentrations in the rivers. However, one of the facilities (the West End plant) was discharging higher concentrations of MeHg, up to 2 ng/L, causing calculated increases of up to 11% in the concentration of MeHg in the Assiniboine River.
40647943|The Ferrous Wheel Hypothesis (Davidson et al. 2003) postulates the abiotic formation of dissolved organic N (DON) in forest floors, by the fast reaction of NO with dissolved organic with dissolved organic matter extracted from six different forest floors under oxic conditions. Solutions differed in DOC concentrations (15-60 mg L), NO concentrations (0, 2, 20 mg NO-N L) and DOC/DON ratio (13.4-25.4). Concentrations of added NO never decreased within 60 min, therefore, no DON formation from added NO took place in any of the samples. Our results suggest that the reaction of NO with natural DOC in forest floors is rather unlikely.
1468977|The effects of enhanced (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> deposition on soil solution cation and anion concentrations and annual ionic fluxes were followed using a standardised experimental protocol in six European coniferous forests with contrasting soil types, pollution inputs and climate. Native soil cores containing a ceramic suction cup were installed in the field, roofed and watered every two weeks with local throughfall or local throughfall with added (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at 75 kg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>. Living root systems were established in half of the lysimeters. Untreated throughfall NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N deposition at the sites ranged from 3.7 to 29 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>. Soil leachates were collected at two weekly intervals over 12 months and analysed for volume, and concentrations of major anions and cations. Increases in soil solution NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in response to N additions were observed after 4-9 months at three sites, whilst one sandy soil with high C:N ratio failed to nitrify under any of the treatments. Changes in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in soil solution controlled soil solution cation concentrations in the five nitrifying soils, with Al<sup>3+</sup> being the dominant cation in the more acid soils with low base saturation. The acidification responses of the soils to the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> additions were primarily related to the ability of the soils to nitrify the added NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. pH and soil texture seemed important in controlling NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> leaching in response to the treatments, with two less acidic, clay/clay loam sites showing almost total retention of added NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, whilst nearly 75% of the added N was leached as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> at the acid sandy soils. The presence of living roots significantly reduced soil solution NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and associated cation concentrations at two of the six sites. The very different responses of the six soils to increased (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> deposition emphasise that the establishment of N critical loads for forest soils need to allow for differences in N storage capacity and nitrification potential.
24715336|Iron and aluminum (oxyhydr)oxides are ubiquitous in the soil environment and have the potential to strongly affect the properties of dissolved organic matter. We examined the effect of oxide surfaces on soluble nutrient dynamics and microbial community composition using an incubation of forest floor material in the presence of (1) goethite and quartz, (2) gibbsite and quartz, and (3) quartz surfaces. Forest floor material was incubated over a period of 154 days. Aqueous extracts of the incubations were harvested on days 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 154, and concentrations of P, N, PO, NO, NO, and organic C were measured in the solutions. Microbial community composition was examined through pyrosequencing of bacterial and fungal small subunit ribosomal RNA genes on selected dates throughout the incubation. Results indicated that oxide surfaces exerted strong control on soluble nutrient dynamics and on the composition of the decomposer microbial community, while possible having a small impact on system-level respiration. Goethite and gibbsite surfaces showed preferential adsorption of P-containing and high molar mass organic solutes, but not of N-containing compounds. On average, organic C concentrations were significantly lower in water extractable organic matter (WEOM) solutions from oxide treatments than from the control treatment (P = 0.0037). Microbial community composition varied both among treatments and with increasing time of incubation. Variation in bacterial and fungal community composition exhibited strong-to-moderate correlation with length of incubation, and several WEOM physiochemical characteristics including apparent (weight averaged) molar mass, pH and electrical conductivity. Additionally, variation in bacterial community composition among treatments was correlated with total P (r = 0.60, P < 0.0001), PO (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001), and organic C (r = 0.36, P = 0.015) concentrations; while variation in fungal communities was correlated with organic C concentrations (r = 0.48, P = 0.0008) but not with phosphorus concentrations. The relatively small impact of oxide surfaces on system-level microbial respiration of organic matter despite their significant effects on microbial community composition and WEOM dynamics lends additional support to the theory of microbial functional redundancy.
20055196|The strength of coupling between canopy gas exchange and root respiration was examined in 15-yr-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. Ex Laws.) growing under seasonally drought stressed conditions. By regularly watering part of the root system to reduce tree water stress and measuring soil CO efflux on the dry, distant side of the tree, we were able to determine the strength of the relationship between soil autotrophic (root and rhizosphere) respiration and changes in canopy carbon uptake and water loss by comparison with control trees (no watering). After 40 days the soil CO efflux rate, relative to pre-treatment conditions, was twice that of the controls. This difference, attributable to root and rhizosphere respiration, was strongly correlated with differences in transpiration rates between treatments (
24715352|This study sought to investigate the hourly and daily timescale responses of soil CO fluxes to temperature in a limed agricultural soil. Observations from different incubation experiments were compared with the results of a model combining biotic (heterotrophic respiration) and abiotic (carbonate weathering) components. Several samples were pre-incubated for 89 days at three temperatures (5, 15 and 25 C) and then submitted to short-term temperature (STT) cycles (where the temperature was increased from 5 to 35 C in 10 C stages, with each stage being 3 h long). During the temperature cycles (hourly timescale), the soil CO fluxes increased significantly with temperature under all preincubation temperature (PIT) treatments. A hysteresis effect and negative fluxes during cooling phases were also systematically observed. At a given hourly timescale temperature, there was a negative relationship of the CO fluxes with the PIT. Using the combined model allowed the experimental results to be clearly described, including the negative fluxes and the hysteresis effect, showing the potentially large contribution of abiotic fluxes to total fluxes in limed soils, after STT changes. The fairly good agreement between the measured and simulated flux results also suggested that the biotic flux temperature sensitivity was probably unaffected by timescale (hourly or daily) or PIT. The negative relationship of the CO fluxes with the PIT probably derived from very labile soil carbon depletion, as shown in the simulations. This was not, however, confirmed by soil carbon measurements, which leaves open the possibility of adaptation within the microbial community.
20055175|Recent studies suggest that the direction and magnitude of changes in soil organic carbon (soil C) pools following forest-to-pasture conversion in the tropics are dependent upon initial soil conditions and local factors (e.g. pre-conversion soil C content, soil texture, vegetation productivity, and management practices). The goal of this study was to understand how landscape-scale variation in soil-forming factors influenced the response of soil C pools to forest clearing and pasture establishment in northeastern Costa Rica. We measured soil C and its stable isotopic composition in 24 paired pasture and reference forest sites distributed over large gradients of edaphic characteristics and slope throughout a 1400 km region. We used the large difference in stable C isotopic signatures of C3 vegetation (rain forest) versus C4 vegetation (pasture grasses) as a tracer of soil C dynamics. Soil C pools to 30 cm depth ranged from 26% lower to 23% higher in pastures compared to paired forests. The presence of non-crystalline clays and percent slope explained between 27 and 37% of the variation in the direction and magnitude of the changes in soil C storage following pasture establishment. Stable carbon isotopes ($\delta {}^{13}\text{C}$) in the top soil (0-10 cm) showed a rapid incorporation of pasture-derived C following pasture establishment, but the vegetation in these pastures never became pure C4 communities. The amount of forest-derived soil C in pasture topsoils (0-10 cm) was negatively correlated to both pasture age and the concentrations of non-crystalline iron oxides. Together these results imply that site factors such as soil mineralogy are an important control over soil C storage and turnover in this region.
1468698|Ground water inputs and outputs of N were studied for a small ground water discharge swamp situated in a headwater drainage basin in southern Ontario, Canada. Darcy's equation with data for piezometers was used to measure inputs of shallow local ground water at the swamp margin and deep regional ground water beneath the swamp. Ground water flux was also quantified by measuring ground water discharge to the outlet stream draining the swamp in combination with a chemical mixing model to separate shallow and deep ground water components based on chloride differences. Estimates of shallow ground water flux determined by these two approaches agreed closely however, the piezometer data seriously underestimated the deep ground water input to the swamp. An average ground water input-output budget of total N (TN) total organic nitrogen (TON) ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N) was estimated for stream base flow periods which occurred on an average of 328 days each year during 1986-1990. Approximately 90% of the annual NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N input was contributed by shallow ground water at the swamp margin. Deep ground water represented about 65% of the total ground water input and a similar proportion of TON and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N inputs. Annual ground water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N inputs and outputs were similar whereas NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N retention was 4 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> representing about 68% of annual ground water input. Annual TON inputs in ground water exceeded outputs by 7.7 kg ha (27%). The capacity of the swamp to regulate ground water N fluxes was influenced by the N chemistry of ground water inputs and the hydrologic pathways of transport within the swamp.
1469034|Denitrification was measured in hyporheic, parafluvial, and bank sediments of Sycamore Creek, Arizona, a nitrogen-limited Sonoran Desert stream. We used three variations of the acetylene block technique to estimate denitrification rates, and compared these estimates to rates of nitrate production through nitrification. Subsurface sediments of Sycamore Creek are typically well-oxygenated, relatively low in nitrate, and low in organic carbon, and therefore are seemingly unlikely sites of denitrification. However, we found that denitrification potential (C & N amended, anaerobic incubations) was substantial, and even by our conservative estimates (unamended, oxic incubations and field chamber nitrous oxide accumulation), denitrification consumed 5-40% of nitrate produced by nitrification. We expected that denitrification would increase along hyporheic and parafluvial flowpaths as dissolved oxygen declined and nitrate increased. To the contrary, we found that denitrification was generally highest at the upstream ends of subsurface flowpaths where surface water had just entered the subsurface zone. This suggests that denitrifiers may be dependent on the import of surface-derived organic matter, resulting in highest denitrification rate at locations of surface-subsurface hydrologic exchange. Laboratory experiments showed that denitrification in Sycamore Creek sediments was primarily nitrogen limited and secondarily carbon limited, and was temperature dependent. Overall, the quantity of nitrate removed from the Sycamore Creek ecosystem via denitrification is significant given the nitrogen-limited status of this stream.
40343632|Wetlands, and peatlands in particular, are important sources of methylmercury (MeHg) to susceptible downstream ecosystems and organisms, but very little work has addressed MeHg production and export from peatland-dominated watersheds during the spring snowmelt. Through intensive sampling, hydrograph separation, and mass balance, this study investigated the total mercury (THg) and MeHg fluxes from two upland-peatland watersheds in Minnesota, USA during the 2005 spring snowmelt and proportionally attributed these fluxes to either peatland runoff or upland runoff. Between 26% and 39% of the annual THg flux and 22-23% of the annual MeHg flux occurred during the 12-days snowmelt study period, demonstrating the importance of large hydrological inputs to the annual mercury flux from these watersheds. Upland and peatland runoff were both important sources of THg in watershed export. In contrast to other research, our data show that peatland pore waters were the principal source of MeHg to watershed export during snowmelt. Thus, despite cold and mostly frozen surface conditions during the snowmelt period, peatland pore waters continued to be an important source of MeHg to downstream ecosystems.
4151503|Several studies have highlighted an increase in DOC concentration in streams and lakes of UK upland catchments though the causal mechanisms controlling the increase have yet to be fully explained. This study, compiles a comprehensive data set of DOC concentration records for UK catchments to evaluate trends and test whether observed increases are ubiquitous over time and space. The study analysed monthly DOC time series from 198 sites, including 29 lakes, 8 water supply reservoirs and 161 rivers. The records vary in length from 8 to 42 years going back as far as 1961. Of the 198 sites, 153 (77%) show an upward trend in DOC concentration significant at the 95% level, the remaining 45 (23%) show no significant trend and no sites show a significant decrease in DOC concentration. The average annual increase in DOC concentration was 0.17 mg C/l/year. The dataset shows: (i) a spatial consistent upward trend in the DOC concentration independent of regional effects of rainfall, acid and nitrogen deposition, and local effects of land-use change; (ii) a temporally consistent increase in DOC concentration for period back as far as the 1960s; (iii) the increase in DOC concentration means an estimated DOC flux from the UK as 0.86 Mt C for the year 2002 and is increasing at 0.02 Mt C/year. Possible reasons for the increasing DOC concentration are discussed.
1469805|Net export of sulphate from watersheds may delay the response of surface waters to changes in acid deposition. Long-term (18-yr) sulphate budgets were calculated for 8 headwater streams located in the acid-sensitive region of Muskoka-Haliburton, south central Ontario. Sulphate deposition in this region has decreased by almost 40% over the last 2 decades, and sulphate export from catchments has also generally declined over time, but most catchments are still a net source of sulphate to drainage streams. Net export of sulphate occurred in the majority of catchments in most years of record, but was particularly large following dry, warmer than average summers, when stream flow ceased for up to several weeks at a time. In years with warm dry summers, such as occurred in 1983/84 and between 1987/88 and 1990/91, inclusive, stream export from most catchments was between 1.5 and 2 times greater than was input via bulk deposition. Annual average sulphate concentrations in streams were strongly correlated with stream dryness, and were greater in years in which streams were dry for longer periods of time. Temporal patterns of annual sulphate concentrations and export were highly coherent among the 8 streams, and net sulphate export occurred in both wetland-draining and predominantly upland streams. Climate variables, specifically temperature and precipitation act on a regional scale and are likely responsible for similar temporal patterns of sulphate retention among these 8 physiographically different catchments. Net sulphate export from catchments may delay the recovery of acid impacted surface waters, despite reductions in industrial SO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
20519825|The flux of nitrogen in large rivers in North America and Europe is well explained as a function of the net anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen to the landscape, with on average 20 to 25% of these inputs exported in rivers and 75 to 80% of the nitrogen retained or denitrified in the landscape. Here, we use data for average riverine nitrogen fluxes and anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen over a 6-year period (1988-1993) for 16 major watersheds in the northeastern United States to examine if there is also a climatic influence on nitrogen fluxes in rivers. Previous studies have shown that for any given river, nitrogen fluxes are greater in years with higher discharge, but this can be interpreted as storage of nitrogen in the landscape during dry years and flushing of this stored nitrogen during wet years. Our analyses demonstrate that there is also a longer-term steady-state influence of climate on riverine nitrogen fluxes. Those watersheds that have higher precipitation and higher discharge export a greater fraction of the net anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen. This fractional export ranges from 10 to 15% of the nitrogen inputs in drier watersheds in the northeastern United States to over 35% in the wetter watersheds. We believe this is driven by lower rates of denitrification in the wetter watersheds, perhaps because shorter water residence times do not allow for as much denitrification in riparian wetlands and low-order streams. Using mean projections for the consequences of future climate change on precipitation and discharge, we estimate that nitrogen fluxes in the Susquehanna River to Chesapeake Bay may increase by 3 to 17% by 2030 and by 16 to 65% by 2095 due to greater fractional delivery of net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs as precipitation and discharge increase. Although these projections are highly uncertain, they suggest a need to better consider the influence of climate on riverine nitrogen fluxes as part of management efforts to control coastal nitrogen pollution.
20519853|To evaluate the effect of human activities on the amount of nitrogen (N) transported to the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), we have developed and applied a model to estimate the riverine N transport from watersheds draining into the upper Changjiang River basin. By using this model and a database of agricultural statistics, we study the temporal and spatial changes in N inputs to watersheds and surface waters. The total amount of N transported to the surface drainage waters from the agro-ecosystem in 2000 showed a 2.9-fold increase over that in 1980. Considering a constant (37%) loss rate from the river, the annual amount of N transported to the TGD from the agro-ecosystem of the Changjiang river upper basin was about 0.35  10, 0.47  10, 0.59  10, 0.64  10 and 1.01  10 t in 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000, respectively. Further, the transported amount of new anthropogenic reactive N approximately quadrupled in 2000, while the amount of riverine N due to rural human waste varied slightly. Of the total N transported to surface drainage waters in 10 watersheds in 2000, the Jialingjiang watershed accounted for 35%; the TGD region, 15%; and the Toujiang, Wujiang and Minjiang watersheds, 11% each. In 1980, the N sources were concentrated in the rural areas surrounding Chendu City and Chongqing City; however, these sources considerably expanded in the 1990s. The increased use of synthetic fertilizers and the decrease in the fertilizer N-use efficiency are implicated as major causal factors of increased riverine N transport; the calculated amount of N transported to the main tributaries agrees well with previously reported data.
1469419|The influence of liming on leaching and distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) in mineral soil was investigated in a leaching experiment with soil columns. Soil samples from separate horizons (O, A and B horizons) were collected from control and limed plots in a field liming experiment in a spruce forest in southern Sweden. The field liming (0.88 kg m<sup>-2</sup>) had been carried out 8 years before sampling. To minimize the variation among replicates, soil profiles were reconstructed in the laboratory so that the dry weight was the same for each individual soil horizon regardless of treatment. Two soil column types were used with either the O+A horizons or the O+A+B horizons. One Norway spruce seedling (Picea abies (L.) Karst) was planted in each soil column. Average pH in the leachate water was greater in the limed treatment than in the control treatment (5.0 versus 4.0 for O+A columns and 4.3 versus 3.8 for O+A+B columns). After reaching an approximate steady state, the leaching of DOC was 3-4 times greater from the limed O+A and O+A+B columns than from the corresponding control columns but the leaching of DON increased (3.5 times) only in the limed O+A columns. There was a significant correlation between DOC and DON in the leachates from all columns except for the control O+A+B columns, which indicated a decoupling of DOC and DON retention in the B horizon in the control treatment. This might be explained by a selective adsorption of nitrogen poor hydrophobic compounds (C/N ratio: 32-77) while there was a lower retention of nitrogen rich hydrophilic compounds (C/N ratio: 14-20). Proportionally more hydrophobic compounds were leached from the limed soil compared to the unlimed soil. These hydrophobic compounds also became more enriched in nitrogen after liming so in the limed treatment nitrogen might be adsorbed at nearly the same proportion as carbon, which might explain the fact that there was no decoupling of leached DOC and DON from the B horizon after liming.
1469369|Suspended sediments collected during rain events were analysed to assess the maximum potential bioavailability of particulate phosphorus (PP). Physical (separation by particle size) and chemical (sequential extraction) fractionation techniques were applied. Time differentiated sampling during rain events revealed that changes in the concentrations of soluble and particle bound phosphorus, and in the proportion of different PP phases, are due to the changing contribution of various sources of runoff and to flow related variations in particle size. Size fractionation and the extraction of PP phases, can help to distinguish resuspended sediments from sediments coming directly from outside the channel. In light of a former study, investigating PP sedimentation and transformations within the sediments of Lake Sempach, our results lead to the conclusion that, at least 25% (particulate inorganic and reductive soluble P) and at most 70% of the allochthonous PP supply transported during a single rain event, may become bioavailable after early diagenesis in the lake sediments. The uncertainty is due to the unknown time span necessary for the diagenesis, at the lake sediment surface, of particulate organic phosphorus of allochthonous origin.
1468547|Residual soils (saprolites) developed on crystalline rocks appear to form by an essentially isovolumetric process (i.e. without dilation or compaction). Isovolumetric geochemical analysis of a suite of saprolite samples developed on a common parent rock can be used to estimate the relative rates of long-term losses of P and Si during weathering. Using the export of dissolved Si in rivers as a weathering index, one can then estimate the rate of P release due to chemical weathering by means of the P-Si loss ratio in saprolite. For three basins where data are available (Liberty Hill, SC; Amazon River, Brazil: Rio Negro, Brazil) estimated P weathering release rates are 163, 457, and 242 moles P km<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These compare to precipitation inputs of 684, 700 and 630 moles P km<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and total river exports of 256, 4490 and 820 moles P km<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The Rio Negro shows a near perfect balance between the input of P via precipitation and chemical weathering and the riverine output of dissolved and suspended P. This system, however, raised the unsolved problem of the source that supports the atmospheric P input.
40343584|This paper presents an integrated analysis of organic carbon (C) pools in soils and vegetation, within-ecosystem fluxes and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in three 40-year old Norway spruce stands along a north-south climatic gradient in Sweden, measured 2001-2004. A process-orientated ecosystem model (CoupModel), previously parameterised on a regional dataset, was used for the analysis. Pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) and tree growth rates were highest at the southernmost site (1.6 and 2.0-fold, respectively). Tree litter production (litterfall and root litter) was also highest in the south, with about half coming from fine roots (<1 mm) at all sites. However, when the litter input from the forest floor vegetation was included, the difference in total litter input rate between the sites almost disappeared (190-233 g C m year). We propose that a higher N deposition and N availability in the south result in a slower turnover of soil organic matter than in the north. This effect seems to overshadow the effect of temperature. At the southern site, 19% of the total litter input to the O horizon was leached to the mineral soil as dissolved organic carbon, while at the two northern sites the corresponding figure was approx. 9%. The CoupModel accurately described general C cycling behaviour in these ecosystems, reproducing the differences between north and south. The simulated changes in SOC pools during the measurement period were small, ranging from -8 g C m year in the north to +9 g C m year in the south. In contrast, NEE and tree growth measurements at the northernmost site suggest that the soil lost about 90 g C m year.
40343596|In this study, we examined changes in isotopic (C and C) and spectroscopic (UV and C NMR) properties of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in relation to soil organic matter (SOM) to elucidate the sources and sinks of DOC as water percolates through the soils of two contrasting upland coastal California ecosystemsa redwood forest and a coastal prairie. Despite differences in the distribution of C stocks and litter chemistry at these two sites, we found similar shifts in DOC chemistry with soil depth. DOC concentrations dropped rapidly with increasing depth, with an accompanying decrease in the C:N ratio, an increase in the C value and an decrease in specific UV adsorption. In the grassland soil, C values declined from current atmospheric values (+70) in the surface horizon to 75 at 100 cm. In the redwood soil, the C value of 111 in O horizon leachates was indicative of OM with a residence time of 8-10 yrs, with a decrease in C values to 80 at 100 cm. Solid-state CP/MAS C NMR spectra were generally most similar to highly humified OM, with a general decrease in the relative abundance of aromatic compounds and an increase in the alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratio with increasing depth. All of these trends are consistent with the shifts in SOM properties with increasing depth, which are interpreted to mean a shift from fresh plant material to older, highly altered OM. In this Mediterranean climate, we found distinct seasonal shifts in the quantity and composition of DOC found in soil solution during the winter rainy period that was also consistent with a shift from recent labile substrates to older, highly altered OM. These results fit in with a growing body of literature suggesting that the source of much of the DOC within mineral soils is the local soil OM, and the C data, in particular, indicate that DOC at depth is not simply the fraction of surficial leachates that have not been adsorbed or decomposed. Rather, exchange reactions with a portion of the more stabilized SOM pool exert the strongest control on both the concentration and composition of DOC found in these soils.
1469341|In the rhizosphere, biotic and abiotic processes interact to create a zone distinct from the bulk soil that may strongly influence the biogeochemistry of forest ecosystems. This paper presents a conceptual model based upon three operationally defined soil-root compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere and soil-root interface) to assess nutrient availability in the mineral soil-root system. The model is supported by chemical and mineralogical analyses from bulk and rhizosphere soils collected from a Norway spruce forest. The rhizosphere was more intensively weathered and had accumulated more acidity, base cations and phosphorus than the bulk soil. The quantity and quality of organic matter regulate the reciprocal relationships between soil and roots with their associated biota. However, the biogeochemical role of organic matter in the rhizosphere still remains as an area in which more future research is needed. The mechanisms that may regulate nutrient availability in the rhizosphere are also discussed and related to nutrient cycling and adaptation of forests growing under nutrient poor or perturbed conditions. We suggest that the rhizosphere is not an ephemeral environment in the soil, but persists over time and is resilient against perturbation as evinced by consistent differences between rhizosphere and bulk chemistry and mineralogy over wide range of field treatments.
1469570|Methylated and total Hg, and TOC concentrations were measured in precipitation and runoff in a first order Precambrian Shield watershed, and in precipitation, throughfall, shallow groundwater and runoff in a zero Precambrian Shield watershed. Plots dominated by open lichen-covered bedrock and another containing small patches of conifer forest and thin discontinuous surficial deposits were monitored within the zero order catchment. Methyl (3-10 fold) and non-methyl (1.4-2.8 fold) Hg concentrations changed irregularly during rainfall and snowmelt runoff events in all catchments. Temporal patterns of Hg concentration in runoff included flushing and subsequent dilution as well as peak concentrations coinciding with peak or recession flow. Mercury export was highest from lichen-covered bedrock surfaces as a result of high runoff yields and minimal opportunity for physical retention and in the case of MeHg demethylation. Forest canopy and lichen/bedrock surfaces were often net sources for Hg while forest soils were mostly sinks. However, upland soils undergoing periodic reducing conditions appear to be sites for the in situ production of MeHg.
1469071|The purpose of this study was to estimate the resistance to methane release of the above-ground portion of Carex, a wetland sedge, and to determine the locus of methane release from the plant. Measurements conducted on plants clipped to different heights above the water level revealed that the methane flux from clipped plants was on the order of 97% to 111% of control (unclipped) values. The greatest increase was observed in the initial flux measurement after the plants had been clipped to a height of 10 cm. Subsequent measurements on the 10 cm high stubble were similar to control values. When the ends of plants which had been clipped to 10 cm were sealed, the methane flux was reduced to 65% of control values. However, sealing had no effect on the flux from plants which were clipped at 15 cm and higher, indicating that virtually all methane was released on the lower 15 cm of the plants as they emerged from the water. The results indicate that the above-ground portions of Carex at our study site offered only slight resistance to the passage of methane, and that the main sites limiting methane emission are below-ground, at either the porewater-root or root-shoot boundary. We hypothesize that the transitory increase in flux associated with clipping was due to the episodic release of methane held within the plant lacunae. The buildup of CH<sub>4</sub> partial pressure within lacunal spaces overcomes the resistance to gas transport offered by aboveground parts.
1468555| This paper reports laboratory experiments on dinitrogen fixation and denitrification for two small quaking fens (discharge fen and recharge fen) using the acetylene reduction assay and the acetylene inhibition technique, respectively. Nitrogenase activity was detected in peat muck and associated with Alnus glutinosa saplings throughout the study period (May-October 1987), whereas no activity was observed associated with Sphagnum species. The annual amount of dinitrogen fixed was estimated at 2.1 and 12.7 kg N/ha/y for the recharge fen and the discharge fen, respectively. Denitrification at ambient nitrate levels (0.1 ppm NO<sub>3</sub>) was absent in the discharge fen and very low in the recharge fen (0.1 g N/g/d, or 0.3 kg N/ha/y). In nitrate-amended soil samples denitrification rates were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher. It is argued that in situ denitrification rates in the fens studied will depend almost entirely on the nitrate supply by precipitation. Denitrification rates associated with precipitation are estimated at 1.1 kg N/ha/y for both fens. 
1469587|Many forest soils in the Mediterranean basin are shallow and contain high amounts of gravel in the organic layers. Recent studies on soil organic matter accumulation have shown high amounts of organic matter occurring mainly in soils with high levels of stoniness at the soil surface. The gravel layer may affect the microclimatic conditions of the soil surface and probably the distribution and activity of soil fauna. In order to quantify the combined effects soil fauna (epigeic macrofauna and earthworms) and stoniness on the release of soil CO<sub>2</sub>, we performed a three factor field experiment by using a series of reconstructed soil profiles. Factors 1 and 2 consisted of the exclusion/presence of soil epigeic macrofauna and earthworms, and factor 3 of the presence/absence of a gravel layer intermingled with the H horizon. We incubated <sup>14</sup>C straw in the H horizon and carried out three 40 mm rainfall simulations. Soil respiration primarily depended on the season. The effects of soil fauna were generally small and did not coincide with periods of high faunal activity. The largest effects of both earthworms and soil epigeic fauna were found after wetting the soil in summer. The effects of the earthworms were concentrated in the mineral soil while the effects of the epigeic fauna were concentrated in the H horizon and mainly arose towards the end of the experiment. This suggests that the effects of epigeic fauna may have been underestimated due to the length of the experiment. The gravel layer increased the effect of fauna probably by creating more favorable microclimatic conditions. The accumulation of organic matter in soils with high levels of stoniness cannot be explained by the effect of gravel on soil microclimate nor by its effect on the activity of soil fauna.
41490478|In-stream nitrogen processing in the Mississippi River has been suggested as one mechanism to reduce coastal eutrophication in the Gulf of Mexico. Aquatic macrophytes in river channels and flood plain lakes have the potential to temporarily remove large quantities of nitrogen through assimilation both by themselves and by the attached epiphyton. In addition, rooted macrophytes act as oxygen pumps, creating aerobic microsites around their roots where coupled nitrification-denitrification can occur. We used in situ NNO tracer mesocosm experiments to measure nitrate assimilation rates for macrophytes, epiphyton, and microbial fauna in the sediment in Third Lake, a backwater lake of the upper Mississippi River during June and July 2005. We measured assimilation over a range of nitrate concentrations and estimated a nitrate mass balance for Third Lake. Macrophytes assimilated the most nitrate (29.5 mg N m d) followed by sediment microbes (14.4 mg N m d) and epiphytes (5.7 mg N m d) Assimilation accounted for 6.8% in June and 18.6% in July of total nitrate loss in the control chambers. However, denitrification (292.4 mg N m d) is estimated to account for the majority (82%) of the nitrate loss. Assimilation and denitrification rates generally increased with increasing nitrate concentration but denitrification rates plateaued at about 5 mg N L. This suggests that backwaters have the potential to remove a relatively high amount of nitrate but will likely become saturated if the load becomes too large.
1469636| Several lines of evidence suggest that nitrogen in most tropical forests is relatively more available than N in most temperate forests, and even that it may function as an excess nutrient in many tropical forests. If this is correct, tropical forests should have more open N cycles than temperate forests, with both inputs and outputs of N large relative to N cycling within systems. Consequent differences in both the magnitude and the pathways of N loss imply that tropical forests should in general be more <sup>15</sup>N enriched than are most temperate forests. In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the nitrogen stable isotopic composition of tree leaves and soils from a variety of tropical and temperate forests. Foliar  <sup>15</sup>N values from tropical forests averaged 6.5 higher than from temperate forests. Within the tropics, ecosystems with relatively low N availability (montane forests, forests on sandy soils) were significantly more depleted in <sup>15</sup>N than other tropical forests. The average  <sup>15</sup>N values for tropical forest soils, either for surface or for depth samples, were almost 8 higher than temperate forest soils. These results provide another line of evidence that N is relatively abundant in many tropical forest ecosystems. 
1468522|Porewater species and solid inorganic sulfur speciation were measured before and after the spring tide (which occurs over a 6-7 day period) during a portion of the summer seasons of 1987, 1988 and 1989 in Great Marsh, Delaware. Samples were taken from two locations in the marsh (near creek and mid-marsh) inhabited by the short form of Spartina alterniflora. In 1987, pyrite and thiosulfate decreased over the spring tide. Other porewater species also underwent large changes in concentration -- in some cases order of magnitude. However, in 1988 and 1989, there was no evidence for short term changes of pyrite. In 1988, drought conditions were prevalent throughout the sampling whereas in 1989 wet conditions were prevalent. Porewater parameters demonstrated that oxidation was extensive during the sampling period in 1988 and related to dessication. Both climatic and spring tidal flooding conditions have a pronounced affect on the chemistry of the system. Data from atmospherically derived radionuclides (<sup>210</sup>Pb,<sup>137</sup>Cs,<sup>7</sup>Be) indicate that bioturbation is not as important at the mid-marsh site as at the near creek site. Porewater chloride and <sup>7</sup>Be data support infiltration of overlying waters at both sites. The decrease in pyrite over the spring tide in the 1987 samples is related to oxidation. The possible oxidants are discussed and Fe(III) is the favored direct oxidant based upon a review of field and laboratory data. Iron(III) was measured in several filtered porewater samples. However, we cannot indicate with certainty that the Fe(III) is always soluble. The Fe(III) measured may be colloidal or complexed. Pyrite oxidation is noted when the Fe(III) to Fe(II) ratio, pH and alkalinity are all low.
40800606|Liming has been used to mitigate effects of acidic deposition in forest ecosystems. This study was designed to examine the effects of calcium (Ca) supply on the spatial patterns and the relations between soil and soil solution chemistry in a basepoor forest watershed. Watershed 1 at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA was experimentally treated with wollastonite (Ca-SiO) in October, 1999. Exchangeable Ca (Ex-Ca), soil pH s (in 0.01 M CaCl), effective cation exchange capacity (CEC e ), and effective base saturation (BS e ) increased, while exchangeable acidity (Ex-Acid) decreased in organic soil horizons in 2000 and 2002. Mineral soils experienced either small increases in Ex-Ca, pH s , CEC e , BS e , small decreases in Ex-Acid or no changes. Thus, most of the added Ca remained in the forest floor during the study period. Prior to the treatment the BS e decreased with increasing elevation in organic and mineral soil horizons. This spatial pattern changed significantly in the forest floor after the treatment, suggesting that soils at higher elevations were more responsive to the chemical addition than at lower elevations. Soil solutions draining the forest floor responded to the treatment by increases in concentrations of Ca, dissolved silica, pH, and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and a decrease in inorganic monomeric Al (Al) . Treatment effects diminished with increasing soil depth and decreasing elevation. Positive correlations between Ca/total monomeric Al (Al m ) in soil solution and Ex-Ca/Ex-Al ratios in soil indicated that changes in the chemistry of soils significantly influenced the chemistry of soil water, and that Ca derived from the dissolution of wollastonite mitigated the mobilization of Al within the experimental watershed.
20519894|An experimental system for sampling trace gas fluxes through seasonal snowpack was deployed at a subalpine site near treeline at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. The sampling manifold was in place throughout the entire snow-covered season for continuous air sampling with minimal disturbance to the snowpack. A series gases (carbon dioxide, water vapor, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, ozone, volatile organic compounds) was determined in interstitial air withdrawn at eight heights in and above the snowpack at hourly intervals. In this paper, carbon dioxide data from 2007 were used for evaluation of this technique. Ancillary data recorded inlcuded snow physical properties, i.e., temperature, pressure, and density. Various vertical concentration gradients were determined from the multiple height measurements, which allowed calculation of vertical gas fluxes through the snowpack using Fick's 1st law of diffusion. Comparison of flux results obtained from different height inlet combinations show that under most conditions fluxes derived from individual gradient intervals agree with the overall median of all data within a factor of 1.5. Winds were found to significantly influence gas concentration and gradients in the snowpack. Under the highest observed wind conditions, concentration gradients and calculated fluxes dropped to as low as 13% of non-wind conditions. Measured differential pressure amplitude exhibited a linear relationship with wind speed. This suggests that wind speed is a sound proxy for assessing advection transport in the snow. Neglecting the wind-pumping effect resulted in considerable underestimation of gas fluxes. An analysis of dependency of fluxes on wind speeds during a 3-week period in mid-winter determined that over this period actual gas fluxes were most likely 57% higher than fluxes calculated by the diffusion method, which omits the wind pumping dependency.
1469328|The forms and partitioning of aqueous mercury species in the canals and marshes of the Northern Florida Everglades exhibit strong spatial and temporal variability. In canals feeding Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A, unfiltered total Hg (HgT<sub>U</sub>) is less than 3 ng L<sup>-1</sup> and relatively constant. In contrast, methyl mercury (MeHg) exhibited a strong seasonal pattern, with highest levels entering WCA-2A marshes during July. Stagnation and reduced flows also lead to particle enrichment of MeHg. In the marshes of WCA-2A, 2B and 3A, HgT<sub>U</sub> is usually <latex>$<5\ \text{ng L}^{-1}$</latex> with no consistent north-south patterns. However, for individual dates, aqueous unfiltered MeHg (MeHg<sub>U</sub>) levels increase from north to south with generally lowest levels in the eutrophied regions of northern WCA-2A. A strong relationship between filtered Hg species and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), evident for rivers draining wetlands in Wisconsin, was not apparent in the Everglades, suggesting either differences in the binding sites of DOC between the two regions, or non-organic Hg complexation in the Everglades.
1468585|Silica budgets for Lake Michigan and Lake Superior differ in several respects. Mass balance calculations for both lakes agree with previous studies in that permanent burial of biogenic silica in sediments may be only about 5% of the biogenic silica produced by diatoms. Because dissolution rates are large, good estimates of permanent burial of diatoms can not be obtained indirectly from the internal cycle of silica (silica uptake by diatoms and subsequent dissolution) but must be obtained from the sediment stratigraphy. The annual net production of biogenic silica in Lake Michigan requires 71% of the winter maximum silica reservoir which must be maintained primarily by internal cycling in this large lake whereas the comparable silica demand in Lake Superior is only 8.3%. The greater silica demand in Lake Michigan is the result of phosphorus enrichment which has increased diatom production. It is hypothesized that steady-state silica dynamics in Lake Michigan were disrupted by increased diatom production between 1955 and 1970 and that a new steady state based on silica-limited diatom production developed after 1970. Mass balance calculations for Lake Michigan show in contrast with previous work that the hypothesized water column silica depletion of 3.0 g m<sup>-3</sup> could have occurred even though 90% or more of the biogenic silica production is recycled.
1469479| Intermittent drainage of rice fields is discussed as an option to mitigate emission of CH<sub>4</sub>, an important greenhouse gas. However N<sub>2</sub>O, a potentially more effective greenhouse gas, may be emitted during the aeration phase. Therefore, the metabolism of NO, N<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and the kinetics of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation were measured after aeration of methanogenic rice field soil. Before aeration, the soil contained NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in relatively high concentrations (about 4 mM), while NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were almost undetectable. Immediately after aeration both NO and N<sub>2</sub>O were produced with rates of about 15 pmol h<sup>-1</sup> gdw<sup>-1</sup> and 5 pmol h<sup>-1</sup> gdw<sup>-1</sup> respectively. Simultaneously, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> decreased while NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> accumulated. Later on, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> was depleted while NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations increased. Characteristic phases of nitrogen turnover were associated with the activities of ammonium oxidizers, nitrite oxidizers and denitrifiers. Oxidation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and production of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O were inhibited by 10 Pa acetylene demonstrating that nitrification was obligatory for the initiation of nitrogen turnover and production of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O. Ammonium oxidation was not limited by the available NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and thus, concomittant production of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O was not stimulated by addition of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. However, addition of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> stimulated production of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O in both anoxic and aerated rice soil slurries. In this case, 10 Pa acetylene did not inhibit the production of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O demonstrating that it was due to denitrification which was obviously limited by the availability of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. In the aerated soil slurries CH<sub>4</sub> was only oxidized if present at elevated concentrations (<latex>$>50\ \text{ppmv CH}_{4}$</latex>). At atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations (1.7 ppmv) CH<sub>4</sub> was not consumed, but was even slightly produced. CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation activity increased after preincubation at 20% CH<sub>4</sub>, and then CH<sub>4</sub> was also oxidized at atmospheric concentrations. CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation kinetics exhibited sigmoid characteristics at low CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations presumably because of inhibition of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. 
1468921|Field and laboratory studies were conducted to determine effects of nitrogen fertilizers and soil water content on N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes in a humisol located on the Central Experimental Farm of Agriculture Canada, Ottawa. Addition of 100 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> as either urea or NaNO<sub>3</sub> had no significant effect on soil CH<sub>4</sub> flux measured using chambers. Fertilization with NaNO<sub>3</sub> resulted in a significant but transitory stimulation of N<sub>2</sub>O production. Inorganic soil N profiles and the potential nitrification rate suggested that much of the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> from urea hydrolysis was rapidly nitrified. CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes measured using capped soil cores agreed well with fluxes measured using field chambers, and with fluxes calculated from soil gas concentration gradients using Fick's diffusion law. This humisol presents an ideal, unstructured, vertically homogeneous system in which to study gas diffusion, and the influence of gas-filled porosity on CH<sub>4</sub> uptake. In soil cores gradually saturated with H<sub>2</sub>O, the relationship of CH<sub>4</sub> flux to gas-filled porosity was an exponential rise to a maximum. Steepening CH<sub>4</sub> concentration gradients partially compensated for the decreasing diffusion coefficient of CH<sub>4</sub> in soil matrix air as water content increased, and diffusion limitation of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation occurred only at water contents > 130% (dry weight), or gas-filled porosities < 0.2.
1469267|Limestone applications to the catchment of one tributary to Woods Lake were highly effective in reducing stream acidity and stabilizing seasonal fluctuations in pH. The resulting improvement in stream water quality also led to a dramatic shift in reproductive strategy of the Woods Lake brook trout population. Prior to catchment liming, brook trout in Woods Lake were restricted to spawning on poor quality near shore substrate with limited ground water seepage. Reproductive success was limited by high mortality of eggs and larvae and recruitment from in lake spawning was not successful. Spawning brook trout did not utilize the tributary for spawning prior to watershed liming. Mitigation of acidity in the tributary, by catchment liming, effectively extended the spawning habitat available to the Woods Lake brook trout population and one year following treatment brook trout spawned successfully in the tributary for the first time in 6 years of observation. Significant recruitment of young trout into the lake population occurred from 1991 through 1993, although the absolute number of fish captured was relatively small. In the fall of 1993, four year classes of naturally spawned brook trout were present in the lake. Although reproductive success was enhanced by improving tributary spawning habitat in the Woods Lake basin, self maintenance of the population may be limited by low recruitment rates of young trout, due to high levels of summer mortality resulting from predation. Mitigation of this constraint would require substantially higher levels of fry production than were observed in Woods Lake and/or enhanced refugia for young trout. The results of this experiment suggest that re-establishment of tributary spawning populations of brook trout may be possible, with future reductions in acidic deposition, in acidic Adirondack lakes with limited in-lake spawning habitat.
1468554|The nitrogen cycle in the lower river Rhine was analysed, using data on concentrations of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate, measured in the period from 1972 to 1986. The massive discharge of ammonium in densely populated areas in the Federal Republic of Germany led to microbial nitrification, detectable as decreases in ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the lower river Rhine over reaches 85-133 km long. The distribution of the nitrogen-rich Rhine waters over three different branches in the Netherlands permits some of the factors governing microbial nitrification in the river bed to be discriminated. In the fast-flowing main channel, intensively used by ships, nitrification is more important than in the smaller branches, despite the short residence time of the water in the main channel. Differences in the flow rate of water, in grain size distribution of sediments, and in intensity of shipping (aeration, turbulence) seemed to be responsible for the different rates of nitrification.
20055281|Nutrients, conductivity and other physical and chemical parameters were measured seasonally in the main channel and in tributaries of the Salado River basin during the period March 1997-June 1999. The sampling began in a low water period and later included flood events. High water events were associated with high proportions of allochthonous compounds (polyphenols, suspended solids and organic matter). Nutrients and conductivity were related to hydrological conditions and different land uses in the catchment. A relationship was found between the land-use and nutrient concentrations due to the inflow of diffuse sources from agricultural lands. High nutrient concentrations and conductivity recorded in the headwaters were, respectively, related to the intensive agriculture in this area and the inflow of saline groundwater, drained by canals from endorheic basin to the main channel. Their effects on the middle and lower reaches were related to the discharge and inputs of other sub-catchments. Nutrients, sulphates, alkalinity and conductivity declined downstream towards the river mouth. The consequences for the plankton community of these spatio-temporal changes in the chemical characteristics are discussed. The heterogeneity of the Salado River is related to seasonality, land use and the geomorphological features of the basin.
1468612|Freeze-dried aqueous extracts of autumn-shed maple leaves, birch leaves, and spruce needles were added to a third-order reach of Bear Brook, New Hampshire at concentrations similar to those predicted to occur during peak leaf fall. Leachate from each species was rapidly removed from solution. With initial concentrations of added leachate of approximately 5 mg l<sup>-1</sup>, dissolved organics (DOC) uptake ranged from 73 to 130 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> for the first five hours of travel downstream from the point of addition. There was no preferential removal of DOC of low molecular weight, or of monomeric carbohydrates relative to phenolics or unidentified DOC. Stream sediments and organic debris rapidly removed DOC from solution in laboratory experiments. No significant flocculation or microbial assimilation of sugar maple leachate occurred in stream water alone. Stream sediments showed small increases in respiration with addition of leaf leachate, but no increase in respiration occurred upon addition of leachate to organic debris. Abiotic adsorption due to the high concentrations of exchangeable iron and aluminium in stream sediments may be responsible for much of the rapid removal of leaf leachate observed in field experiments. Abiotic processes appear to retain DOC within the stream, thereby allowing subsequent metabolism of dissolved organic carbon by stream microflora.
40800597|Water and nutrient budgets were constructed for 13 low-lying peat polders in the Netherlands that varied in elevation relative to sea level (-0.2 to -2.4 m below sea level), land use (7-70% of the total polder area covered by agriculture; largely dairy farming), and surface water prevalence (6-43%). Water balances were verified with chloride budgets and accepted when both met the criterion (total inflows  total outflows)/(total inflows) < 0.05. Apart from precipitation and evapotranspiration (overall means 913 vs. 600 mm), in-and outlet (171 vs. 420 mm) as well as in-and outward seepage (137 vs. 174 mm) were important items in the water budgets. Nutrient budgets, however, were dominated by terms related to agricultural land use (~60% of all inputs, 90% of N-removal and 80% of  removal) rather than water fluxes (8% and 5% of N and P inputs; 6 and 18% of outputs). After agriculture (200 kg N ha y), mineralisation of the peat soil and atmospheric deposition appear to be important inputs (about 94 and 21 kg N ha y). Major output terms were agricultural output (209 kg N ha y) and denitrification (95 kg N ha y). The average N budget was in balance (difference ~ 1 kg N ha y), whereas P accumulated in most polders, particularly those under agriculture. The mean P surplus (15 kg P ha y in the 9 mainly agricultural polders) corresponds well with the accumulated difference observed elsewhere (700 kg P ha in the upper 50 cm in a nature reserve versus 1400 under agriculture) after over 50 years of dairy farming. Bulk retention of N and P in these polders is taking place in the peat soil, through temporary sorption to the matrix and N is lost through denitrification. In a principal components analysis combining land use, landscape pattern, water balance and nutrient budget terms, the three-first principal components explained 63% of the variability. The first component (PC) correlated strongly with the percentage of land under agriculture (r = 0.82) and negatively with the percentage covered by surface water (r =  0.74). Most input and output terms of the nitrogen budget also correlated with this PC. The second PC covaried distinctly with the total area of a polder (r =  0.79) and human population density at municipality level (r = 0.75). Phosphorus loads in inlet and outlet water correlated with this PC. This suggests that the variability in nutrient budgets among polders is largely governed by agricultural land use.
1469625| Information on changes in storage and loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) when tropical forests are converted to cropland is needed for evaluating soil structural degradation and for selecting appropriate sustainable soil management practices. We evaluated changes in SOC storage of organic carbon and acid-hydrolyzable carbohydrates content of aggregated classes and particle size fractions of adjacent forested and cultivated soils in eight agroecosystems from Ethiopian highlands and Nigerian lowlands. In all agroecosystems, SOC content was two to four times higher in the forested than the cultivated soils. Higher SOC content was found in Ethiopian (20.2-47.3 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>) than Nigerian (12.0-24.0 g.kg<sup>-1</sup>) forested soils. The magnitude of reduction in SOC and total carbohydrates with cultivation was soil-specific, being generally higher in the sandy than the clayey soils. The smaller aggregate classes (< 1.00 mm) and the sand-sized particles (2000-63 m) of the forested soils were preferentially enriched in carbohydrates relative to larger aggregates (4.75-1.00 mm). Carbohydrates were more concentrated in the clay-size fraction of the forested than in that of the cultivated soils. Cultivation reduced aggregate stability, increased the proportions of the smaller size aggregates and their associated carbohydrates relative to the forested soils. The susceptibility of the cultivated soils to loss in structural stability reflected this initial aggregation which was greater in the more stable clayey than the fragile sandy soils. The aggregate stability of either the forested or the cultivated soil could not be accounted for by the levels of OC or total carbohydrates in the soil. 
20055306|Little is known on microbial activities in the sediments of large lowland rivers despite of their potentially high influence on biogeochemical budgets. Based on field measurements in a variety of sedimentary habitats typical for a large lowland river (Elbe, Germany), we present results on the abundance and production of sedimentary bacteria, the potential activity of a set of extracellular enzymes, and potential nitrification and denitrification rates. A diving bell was used to access the sediments in the central river channel, enabling us to sample down to 1 m sediment depth. Depth gradients of all measures of microbial activity were controlled by sediment structure, hydraulic conditions, as well as by the supply with organic carbon and nitrogen. Microbial heterotrophic activity was tightly coupled with the availability of carbon and nitrogen, whereas chemolithotrophic activity (nitrification rate) was related to the available surface area of particles. In the central bed of the river, bacterial production and extracellular enzyme activity remained high down to the deepest sediment layers investigated. Due to the large inner surface area and their connectivity with the surface water, the shifting sediments in the central channel of the river were microbially highly active There, vertically integrated bacterial production amounted to 0.95 g C
1469653|The distribution and accumulation of organic matter, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in mangrove soils at four sites along the Shark River estuary of south Florida were investigated with empirical measures and a process-based model. The mangrove nutrient model (NUMAN) was developed from the SEMIDEC marsh organic matter model and parameterized with data from mangrove wetlands. The soil characteristics in the four mangrove sites varied greatly in both concentrations and profiles of soil carbon, N and P. Organic matter decreased from 82% in the upstream locations to 30% in the marine sites. Comparisons of simulated and observed results demonstrated that landscape gradients of soil characteristics along the estuary can be adequately modeled by accounting for plant production, litter decomposition and export, and allochthonous input of mineral sediments. Model sensitivity analyses suggest that root production has a more significant effect on soil composition than litter fall. Model simulations showed that the greatest change in organic matter, N, and P occurred from the soil surface to 5 cm depth. The rapid decomposition of labile organic matter was responsible for this decrease in organic matter. Simulated N mineralization rates decreased quickly with depth, which corresponded with the decrease of labile organic matter. The increase in organic matter content and decrease in soil bulk density from mangrove sites at downstream locations compared to those at upstream locations was controlled mainly by variation in allochthonous inputs of mineral matter at the mouth of the estuary, along with gradients in mangrove root production. Research on allochthonouns sediment input and in situ root production of mangroves is limited compared to their significance to understanding nutrient biogeochemistry of these wetlands. More accurate simulations of temporal patterns of nutrient characteristics with depth will depend on including the effects of disturbance such as hurricanes on sediment redistribution and biomass production.
1468539|Hurricane Danny resulted in the rapid deposition of 10 cm of oxidized, acidic sediment in the Contrary Creek arm of Lake Anna, Virginia. Several biological and geochemical parameters were monitored with time to ascertain how long it took the newly-deposited lake sediments to attain the anaerobic, circumneutral, actively sulfate-reducing state normally observed in this portion of the lake. The sediment platinum-electrode potential dropped from 350 mV to 100 mV within the first week after the storm. The pH of the pore water increased from 4.5 to 5.8 within three weeks, and titratable alkalinity was detected within two weeks and three weeks at 3 cm and 1 cm depths, respectively. Accumulation of reduced products of sulfate reduction (acid volatile sulfide) began by three to four weeks after the storm event. Both methanogens and sulfate reducers were present in high and approximately equal numbers in the freshly deposited material. The rapid neutralization of the acidity in the fresh sediment prior to the onset of sulfate reduction suggests that reactions other than sulfate reduction caused the initial increase in pH and alkalinity in this system.
41490520|Nutrient enrichment threatens river ecosystem health in urban watersheds, but the influence of urbanization on spatial variation in nutrient concentrations and nutrient limitation of biofilm activity are infrequently measured simultaneously. In summer 2009, we used synoptic sampling to measure spatial patterns of nitrate (NO), ammonium (NH), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration, flux, and instantaneous yield throughout the Bronx River watershed within New York City and adjacent suburbs. We also quantified biofilm response to addition of NO, phosphate (PO), and NO + PO on organic and inorganic surfaces in the river mainstem and tributaries. Longitudinal variation in NO was low and related to impervious surface cover across sub-watersheds, but spatial variation in NH and SRP was higher and unrelated to sub-watershed land-use. Biofilm respiration on organic surfaces was frequently limited by PO or NO + PO, while primary production on organic and inorganic surfaces was nutrientlimited at just one site. Infrequent NO limitation and low spatial variability of NO throughout the watershed suggested saturation of biological N demand. For P, both higher biological demand and point-sources contributed to greater spatial variability. Finally, a comparison of our data to synoptic studies of forested, temperate watersheds showed lower spatial variation of N and P in urban watersheds. Reduced spatial variation in nutrients as a result of biological saturation may represent an overlooked effect of urbanization on watershed ecology, and may influence urban stream biota and downstream environments.
1469741|Based on a review of N<sub>2</sub>O field studies in Europe, major soil, climate and management controls of N<sub>2</sub>O release from agricultural mineral soils in the European Union have been identified. Data for these N<sub>2</sub>O emission drivers can easily be gathered from statistical services. Using stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis, empirical first order models of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions have been established which allow -- in contrast to existing large-scale approaches -- a regionally disaggregated estimation of N<sub>2</sub>O emissions at sub-national, national and continental level in the temperate and boreal climate regions of Europe. Arable soils showed lower mean and maximum emissions in oceanic temperate climate ("Temperate West") than in pre-alpine temperate and sub-boreal climate ("Sub-boreal Europe"). Therefore, two separate regression models were developed. Nitrous oxide emissions from arable soils the Temperate West amount to an average flux rate below 2 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and rarely exceed 5 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. They are modelled by the parameters fertiliser, topsoil organic carbon and sand content. In Sub-boreal European arable soils, N<sub>2</sub>O emissions vary in a much wider range between 0 and 27 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in dependence of available nitrogen, represented in the model by fertiliser and topsoil nitrogen content. Compared to existing methods for large scale inventories, the regression models allow a better regional fit to measured values since they integrate additional driving forces for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. For grasslands, a fertiliser-based model was established which yields higher emission estimates than existing ones. Due to an extreme variability, no climate, soil nor management parameters could be included in the empirical grasslands model.
25652607|Organic matter oxidation represents a transfer of elements to inorganic nutrients that support biological productivity and food web processes. Therefore, quantification of the controls of organic matter mineralization is crucial to understanding the carbon cycle and biogeochemical dynamics in coastal marine environments. We investigated the rates and pathways of anaerobic carbon (C) oxidation in an unvegetated mud flat (UMF) and a vegetated mud flat (VMF) of the Ganghwa intertidal zone of the macro-tidal Han River estuary, Yellow Sea. Analyses of geochemical constituents revealed relatively oxidized conditions and high reactive Fe(III) concentrations (40100 mol cm) in the sediments. A pronounced depth stratification in Fe(III) was observed at the VMF site likely due to the lower number of infaunal burrows along with dense root formation by the macrophytes, Suaeda japonica. Depth-integrated rates of anaerobic C mineralization as well as sulfate- and Fe(III) reduction at the VMF were consistently higher than those at the UMF, likely driven by the dense vegetation that supplied organic C substrates and electron acceptors to the rhizosphere. Sediment inventories revealed that solid Fe(III) was up to 17 times more abundant than pore water sulfate, and direct rate measurements showed that microbial Fe(III) reduction comprised an equal or larger percentage of C oxidation (3666%) in comparison to sulfate reduction (3640%) at both sites studied. Time-course experiments indicated that sulfate reduction rates were likely underestimated, especially in the VMF rhizosphere, due to the reoxidation of reduced S in the presence of high Fe(III). The high rates of C mineralization suggest that the Ganghwa intertidal mud flats are a significant sink against the external loading of organic compounds, and organic matter mineralization is enhanced by chemical exchange regulated by extreme tidal flushing and macro-microorganisms interactions.
41490417|The major benthic habitats in a shallow oligotrophic sub-tropical coastal system were mapped, benthic productivity and respiration were measured seasonally (summer, winter) in each open water habitat, and an annual carbon budget was constructed using measured, modelled and literature fluxes to estimate the functional importance of each major benthic habitat to the whole ecosystem. Stable Zostera Seagrass Communities covered 16% of the open water system but made little contribution to whole system metabolism. In contrast, ephemeral Halophila Seagrass Communities covered only 8% of the open water system but contributed 46% of the net productivity (p). The less 'iconic' Inter-and Sub-tidal Pimpama Shoals also only had a small areal extent (10%) but accounted for 50% of the net benthic production. Similarly, Yabby Shoals only covered 27% of the open water system but accounted for 89% of the net respiration (r). Budget estimates suggest that lateral import of organic matter, most likely tidally transported phytoplankton trapped in seagrass beds, across the Broadwater boundaries was required to balance the carbon budget if any reasonable estimate of burial was invoked. However, budget errors make it difficult to distinguish this import from zero. This study demonstrated that shallow subtropical coastal systems have a complex mosaic of benthic habitats, and that some of the less 'iconic' habitats (i.e. non-seagrass, non-mangrove) also make an important functional contribution that controls the flow of energy and nutrients through the whole ecosystem and determines the net ecosystem metabolism and possible exchanges with adjacent systems.
1469739|There is a potential to sequester carbon in soil by changing agricultural management practices. These changes in agricultural management can also result in changes in fossil-fuel use, agricultural inputs, and the carbon emissions associated with fossil fuels and other inputs. Management practices that alter crop yields and land productivity can affect the amount of land used for crop production with further significant implications for both emissions and sequestration potential. Data from a 20-year agricultural experiment were used to analyze carbon sequestration, carbon emissions, crop yield, and land-use change and to estimate the impact that carbon sequestration strategies might have on the net flux of carbon to the atmosphere. Results indicate that if changes in management result in decreased crop yields, the net carbon flux can be greater under the new system, assuming that crop demand remains the same and additional lands are brought into production. Conversely, if increasing crop yields lead to land abandonment, the overall carbon savings from changes in management will be greater than when soil carbon sequestration alone is considered.
41490519|Eutrophication is a major threat to coastal ecosystems. Within Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) has established the need of developing methods of assessment. Bulk chlorophyll "a" is used world-wide as an indicator of eutrophication. However, the size structure of the phytoplankton communities has not been investigated, in detail, in relation to eutrophication pressures. This study investigates the suitability of fractionated chlorophyll "a" (< 10 and > 10 m), as an indicator of eutrophication. Along the Basque coast (northern Spain) several water bodies, ranging from offshore waters to the heads of the estuaries, were surveyed during 2008. Physico-chemical conditions and chlorophyll "a" showed a distinct spatial gradient. Trophic richness increased towards the middle and inner parts of the estuaries, where nutrient inputs, from natural or anthropogenic sources, together with the residence time of the water are usually higher. In summer, phytoplankton biomass and abundance decreased, generally, in offshore and coastal waters; in estuaries, they tended to increase. The chlorophyll distribution within the two size fractions was coherent with the phytoplankton taxonomic composition. In summer, the relative abundance of small-sized cells (diatoms and non-siliceous taxa) increased. The relationships between size-fractionated chlorophyll and physicochemical variables differed, when comparing the offshore and coastal waters, with the estuaries. In the offshore and coastal waters, a strong seasonally was observed; in estuaries, an important spatial component was found. Fractionated chlorophyll provided complementary useful information on anthropogenic pressures. However, more research is necessary to utilise this variable as a tool for ecological status assessment, within the WFD.
1469717| In a one-year field study (June 1998 to April 1999), we quantified N<sub>2</sub>O and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from an extensively managed grassland in NE Bavaria (Germany) in unfertilized controls and after application of slurry or mineral N (calcium ammonium nitrate), respectively. Emissions were measured every 2-4 weeks, with additional daily measurements for 10 days after each fertilizer application. The closed chamber method was used for N<sub>2</sub>O and the open chamber method for NO<sub>x</sub> measurements. Fertilizer applications resulted in significantly increased N<sub>2</sub>O emission rates in comparison to the low annual mean of the control plots (1.4 mol m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Episodical emission peaks during the summer were attributed to high microbial activity after rainfall. Mineral N fertilization resulted in the highest emission rates. Cumulative annual N<sub>2</sub>O emissions were 11.2 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup> for the mineral N, 8.8 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup> for the slurry and 3.4 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup> for the control plots. This represents 10.5% (mineral N) and 7.2% (slurry) of the applied nitrogen. The fertilizer-induced N<sub>2</sub>O emission factors on this extensively managed grassland are high in comparison to emission factors on intensively managed grassland and substantially higher than the 1.5% estimate used by the global emission inventory. NO<sub>x</sub> emissions increased after the first fertilizer application in summer, but not after the two following fertilizations in fall and spring. Differences between treatments were not significant. Annual NO<sub>x</sub> emissions were 1.9 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup> for both, mineral N and slurry plots and 1.5 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup> for the controls, representing 0.5% of the N applied with each fertilizer. The ratio of emitted NO<sub>x</sub> to N<sub>2</sub>O was 1:4.7 for both fertilized treatments (based on N-atoms). 
1468878| The aqueous speciation of Al was studied in acid forest soils in N.W. Spain. Aluminum concentrations were 10-70 mol L<sup>-1</sup>, with variable proportions of labile, nonlabile, and acid-soluble Al. Almost all the labile Al was found complexed with F<sup>-</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup> concentrations being low. The importance of organic matter was seen in the formation of Al-organic complexes in the solid soil fraction and the presence of aqueous alumino-organic complexes in superficial horizons (umbric epipedons) rich in organic matter. 
4151472|We know little about the mechanisms that cause rapid losses in the soil organic N pool during cropping. As the analysis of amino acid enantiomers can provide insight into both the fate of microbial N and the ageing of cells in the environment, we used this technique as a tool to examine how the pool of protein-bound N in subtropical Plinthosols responds to increasing duration of arable cropping. The samples comprised bulk soils (0- 20 cm) and clay fractions from each of three agro-ecosystems in semiarid South Africa; the sites have been cropped for periods varying from 0 to 98 years. The amino acid enantiomers contributed 34% to the total N content. With increasing number of years a piece of land has been cropped, the amino acid concentrations declined bi-exponentially to about 30% of their initial level in the native grasslands. Changes of the remaining soil protein-N pool were indicated by alterations in the D-content of individual amino acids. As the years of arable cropping increased, the proportions of D-alanine and D- glutamic acid increased relative to the respective L-enantiomers. This was attributed to an accumulation of N in residues of bacterial cell walls. In contrast, the D/L-ratios of leucine and aspartic acid declined in the long- term cultivated plots, probably reflecting losses of old amino acid-N reserves at the most degraded arable land.
40343588|A simulation study based on recent regional climate scenarios for Sweden investigated possible changes in carbon (C) dynamics and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of Swedish Norway spruce forest ecosystems. Four sites, representative of well-drained soils in four regions, were included. Stand development was simulated for a 100-year rotation period using a coupled model describing abiotic and biotic processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Two IPCC climate change scenarios, corresponding to a mean annual temperature increase of about 2C (A2) or 3C (B2) from the reference period 19611990 to a new period 20612090, were considered. Annual maximum snow depth decreased with the increase in air temperature, whereas maximum soil frost depth and mean annual soil temperature showed only small changes, especially for the sites in northern Sweden. Simulations suggested that in the warmer climate, gross primary production (GPP) increased by 2432% in northern Sweden and by 3243% in the south. In the north, the increase was related to the combined effect of air and soil temperature extending the growing season, whereas in the south it was mainly governed by increased N availability due to increased soil temperature. NEE increased by about 20% (A2) or 25% (B2) at all sites, more or less solely due to increased accumulation of C in the tree biomass (including harvest residues), since changes in soil C were small compared with the current climate. Both light use efficiency and water use efficiency were improved in the future climate scenarios, despite increases in atmospheric CO not being considered.
1468817|A simultaneous (SIM) sediment extraction procedure for low carbonate sediments, which partitions sediment-bound trace metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Cd) into easily reducible (associated with Mn oxides), reducible (associated with Fe oxides) and alkaline extracted (bound to organic) metal is presented. The SIM method was compared to the sequential (SEQ) extraction procedure of Tessier et al. (1979). Both methods showed good agreement for the partitioning of Zn and Cd among the easily reducible, reducible and organic components of sediment. Both methods also showed the same general distribution of Mn, Fe and Cu among the three sediment components, however concentrations of metals recovered by the two methods differed; less Mn and Fe and more Cu was recovered from sediments by the SEQ vs. the SIM procedure. Less recovery of Mn is in part attributed to the loss of this metal in the 'in between' reagent rinses required in the SEQ procedure. Greater recovery of Cu by the SEQ vs. the SIM method may be due to the pretreatment of sediment with strong reducing agents prior to the step used for liberating organically bound metals. Advantages of a SIM over the SEQ include rapid sample processing time (i.e. the treatment of 40 samples per day vs. 40 samples in three days), plus minimal sample manipulation. Hence, for partitioning metals into easily reducible, reducible and organic sediment components in sediments low in carbonate, we recommend the use of a SIM extraction over that of a SEQ procedure.
40980872|Ion concentrations and fluxes in seepage water (below the main rooting zone) were compared before and after clear cutting at two similar long-term experimental Norway spruce forest plots. While Ballyhooly (Ireland) was influenced by sea salt deposition, Hglwald (Germany) received high nitrogen (N) deposition. These differences were reflected in seepage water concentrations with sodium (Na ) and chloride (Cl) dominating at Ballyhooly and high nitrate (NO) and aluminium concentrations at Hglwald. Following clear cutting of the forest plots, NO concentrations peaked (Ballyhooly: 2018 mol L, Hglwald: 2595 mol L ). Moreover, at Ballyhooly, NO concentrations and fluxes were continuously elevated for ~ 1.5 years. At Hglwald, the clear cut plot, which was replanted with spruce and beech saplings, exhibited periodically elevated NO concentrations with two distinct peaks. However, low concentrations, compared to the control (uncut) plot, were also observed. Further, at Hglwald a plot with a pre-existing dense natural regeneration of Norway spruce exhibited much lower NO concentrations before and after clear cutting. Nonetheless, NO concentrations following clear cut at both sites were elevated at least periodically above European drinking water standards (50 mg L ). An important prerequisite for NO leaching is that forests are N saturated or at least not N-limited; consequently chronic elevated N deposition may lead to increased deterioration of seepage water quality across Europe following forest disturbances (harvesting, windthrow, insect attacks). Clear cutting at Ballyhooly was responsible for significant element loss, especially of potassium, N and calcium, while magnesium loss was compensated by high sea salt inputs. At Hglwald the contamination of seepage water with NO has been the main problem for more than 20 years at the mature stand. A pre-existing regeneration can help to reduce NO and cation leaching after cutting.
1469526|We conducted plant species removals, air temperature manipulations, and vegetation and soil transplants in Alaskan wet-meadow and tussock tundra communities to determine the relative importance of vegetation type and environmental variables in controlling ecosystem methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) flux. Plastic greenhouses placed over wet-meadow tundra increased air temperature, soil temperature, and soil moisture, but did not affect CH<sub>4</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub> flux (measured in the dark). By contrast, removal of sedges in the wet meadow significantly decreased flux of CH<sub>4</sub>, while moss removal tended to increase CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. At 15 cm depth, pore-water CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were higher in sedge-removal than in control plots, suggesting that sedges contribute to CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by transporting CH<sub>4</sub> from anaerobic soil to the atmosphere, rather than by promoting methanogenesis. In reciprocal-ecosystem transplants between the wet-meadow and tussock tundra communities, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were higher overall in the wet-meadow site, but were unrelated to transplant origin. Methane flux was correlated with local variation in soil temperature, thaw depth, and water-table depth, but the relative importance of these factors varied through the season. Our results suggest that future changes in CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> flux in response to climatic change will be more strongly mediated by large-scale changes in vegetation and soil parameters than by direct temperature effects.
41410570|The importance of soil organic matter (SOM) in the global carbon (C) cycle has been highlighted by many studies, but the way in which SOM stabilization processes and chemical composition affect decomposition rates under natural climatic conditions is not yet well understood. To relate the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration to the decomposition potential of SOM, we compared temperature sensitivities of respiration rates from a 2-year long soil translocation experiment from four elevations along a ~ 3000 m tropical forest gradient. We determined SOM stabilization mechanisms and the molecular structure of soil C from different horizons collected before and after the translocation. Soil samples were analysed by physical fractionation procedures, C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The temperature sensitivity (Q) of heterotrophic soil respiration at the four sites along the elevation transect did not correlate with either the available amount of SOM or its chemical structure. Only the relative distribution of C into physical soil fractions correlated with Q values. We therefore conclude that physical fractionation of soil samples is the most appropriate way to assess the temperature sensitivity of SOM.
1468648|Overstory species influence the distribution and dynamics of nutrients in forest ecosystems. Ecosystem-level estimates of Ca, Mg, and K pools and cycles in 50-year old Douglas-fir and red alder stands were used to determine the effect of overstory composition on net cation removal from the mineral soil, i.e. cation export from the soil in excess of additions. Net cation removal from Douglas-fir soil was 8 kg Ca ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, 1 kg Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.3 kg K ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Annual cation export from soil by uptake and accumulation in live woody tissue and O horizon was of similar magnitude to leaching in soil solution. Atmospheric deposition partially off-set export by adding cations equivalent to 28-88% of cation export. Net cation removal from red alder soil was 58 kg Ca ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, 9 kg Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and 11 kg K ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Annual cation accumulation in live woody tissue and O horizon was three times greater than in Douglas-fir, while cation leaching in soil solution was five to eight times greater. The lack of excessive depletion of exchangeable cations in the red alder soil suggests that mineral weathering, rather than exchangeable cations, was the source of most of the removed cations. Nitric acid generated during nitrification in red alder soil led to high rates of weathering and NO<sub>3</sub>-driven cation leaching.
25652625|Soil nutrient environments are changing in forests of the northeastern United States due to decades of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) emissions and acidic deposition, causing N enrichment and cation depletion, and possibly alleviating N limitation to forest growth. We asked whether biotic demand for phosphorus (P) or calcium (Ca) exceeded that for N and used an ingrowth core approach to test belowground responses to different nutrients. We tested fine root foraging for nutrients (N, P, or Ca) in three mid-age (2630 years) and mature (100 years) northern hardwood forest stands in the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF), NH, and in one mature forest stand in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH, USA. Fine root colonization of cores responded clearly to Ca in mature forest at HBEF, responded to P in mid-age forests at BEF, and responded primarily to N in mature forests at BEF. Net N mineralization potential was higher in soils of mid-age than mature forests at BEF, with roots responding to N where N availability was low and to P or Ca where N availability was high. Nutrients elicited no responses from either fungi or phosphatase activity in mid-age forests, but in mature forests at BEF, N enhanced phosphatase activity. While no straightforward pattern emerged among the different mechanisms of nutrient acquisition that we tested, our results do suggest that P and Ca can be important limiting nutrients in these northern hardwood forests when N availability is relatively high. We hypothesize that the interacting effects of disturbance by forest harvest and N deposition can cause a transient P limitation to forest growth, and that other nutrients become more limiting as forests age.
41490465|Iron (Fe) is ubiquitous in forest ecosystems and its cycle is thought to influence the development of soil, particularly Spodosols (podsolization), and the biogeochemistry of macronutrients such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P), as well as many trace metals. The cycle of Fe in northern hardwood forests remains poorly understood. To address some of these uncertainties, we constructed a biogeochemical budget of Fe for a small catchment at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA. Horizonal, temporal, and elevational patterns of concentrations and fluxes of oxidized and reduced Fe species were assessed in leaf litter, soil, soil solution, and stream water. The chemistry of dissolved Fe was evaluated in the context of its relationship with dissolved organic carbon, pH, and dissolved oxygen. Soil solution fluxes of Fe were highest in the organic (Oa, 52.5 mol ha year) horizon and decreased with depth in the mineral (Bh, 50.5 mol ha year , and Bs, 19.7 mol ha year) horizons, consistent with podsolization theories predicting immobilization of Fe following downward transport to mineral soils. TheexportofFe in stream water (1.8 mol ha year) was lower than precipitation input (3.5 mol ha year). The low stream flux indicates most Fe in drainage waters was immobilized in the soil and retained in the watershed. The portion of total Fe as Fe(II) was ~ 10-60% in soil solutions, seemingly high for soils that are considered to be well-drained, oxidizing environments. Organic complexes likely stabilized Fe(II) in solution under oxidizing conditions that would otherwise promote considerably higher Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) ratios. Our study indicates that there are organic matter-derived sources of dissolved Fe(II) as well as substantial mobilization of Fe(II), possibly the result of the reduction of Fe-bearing soil minerals.
4151501|In this study biogeochemical export in a set of catchments that vary from 6ha to almost 1500ha is investigated. Studying catchments across this large range of scales enables us to investigate the scale dependence and fundamental processes controlling catchment biogeochemical export that would not have been possible with a more limited data set. The Devil Canyon catchment, in the San Bernardino Mountains, California, has some of the highest atmospheric N deposition rates in the world (
1469294|At the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, a long-term effort is under way to study responses in ecosystem biogeochemistry to chronic inputs of N in atmospheric deposition in the region. Since 1988, experimental additions of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> (0,5 and 15 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) have been made in two forest stands: Pinus resinosa (red pine) and mixed hardwood. In the seventh year of the study, we measured solute concentrations and estimated solute fluxes in throughfall and at two soil depths, beneath the forest floors (Oa) and beneath the B horizons. Beneath the Oa, concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic C and N (DOC and DON) were higher in the coniferous stand than in the hardwood stand. The mineral soil exerted a strong homogenizing effect on concentrations beneath the B horizons. In reference plots (no N additions), DON composed 56% (pine) and 67% (hardwood) of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) transported downward from the forest floor to the mineral soil, and 98% of the TDN exported from the solums. Under N amendments, fluxes of DON from the forest floor correlated positively with rates of N addition, but fluxes of inorganic N from the Oa exceeded those of DON. Export of DON from the solums appeared unaffected by 7 years of N amendments, but as in the Oa, DON composed smaller fractions of TDN exports under N amendments. DOC fluxes were not strongly related to N amendment rates, but ratios of DOC:DON often decreased. The hardwood forest floor exhibited a much stronger sink for inorganic N than did the pine forest floor, making the inputs of dissolved N to mineral soil much greater in the pine stand. Under the high-N treatment, exports of inorganic N from the solum of the pine stand were increased >500-fold over reference (5.2 vs. 0.01 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), consistent with other manifestations of nitrogen saturation. Exports of N from the solum in the pine forest decreased in the order <latex>$\text{NO}_{3}\text{-N}>\text{NH}_{4}\text{-N}>\text{DON}$</latex>, with exports of inorganic N 14-fold higher than exports of DON. In the hardwood forest, in contrast, increased sinks for inorganic N under N amendments resulted in exports of inorganic N that remained lower than DON exports in N-amended plots as well as the reference plot.
20456585|Black spruce forests are a dominant covertype in the boreal forest region, and they inhabit landscapes that span a wide range of hydrologic and thermal conditions. These forests often have large stores of soil organic carbon. Recent increases in temperature at northern latitudes may be stimulating decomposition rates of this soil carbon. It is unclear, however, how changes in environmental conditions influence decomposition in these systems, and if substrate controls of decomposition vary with hydrologic and thermal regime. We addressed these issues by investigating the effects of temperature, moisture, and organic matter chemical characteristics on decomposition of fibric soil horizons from three black spruce forest sites. The sites varied in drainage and permafrost, and included a "Well Drained" site where permafrost was absent, and "Moderately well Drained" and "Poorly Drained" sites where permafrost was present at about 0.5 m depth. Samples collected from each site were incubated at five different moisture contents (2, 25, 50, 75, and 100% saturation) and two different temperatures (10C and 20C) in a full factorial design for two months. Organic matter chemistry was analyzed using pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry prior to incubation, and after incubation on soils held at 20C, 50% saturation. Mean cumulative mineralization, normalized to initial carbon content, ranged from 0.2% to 4.7%, and was dependent on temperature, moisture, and site. The effect of temperature on mineralization was significantly influenced by moisture content, as mineralization was greatest at 20C and 50-75% saturation. While the relative effects of temperature and moisture were similar for all soils, mineralization rates were significantly greater for samples from the "Well Drained" site compared to the other sites. Variations in the relative abundances of polysaccharide-derivatives and compounds of undetermined source (such as toluene, phenol, 4-methyl phenol, and several unidentifiable compounds) could account for approximately 44% of the variation in mineralization across all sites under ideal temperature and moisture conditions. Based on our results, changes in temperature and moisture likely have similar, additive effects on in situ soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition across a wide range of black spruce forest systems, while variations in SOM chemistry can lead to significant differences in decomposition rates within and among forest sites.
24715098|This study compares the organic chemistry of peat beneath one of last remaining pristine tropical peat forests in Southeast Asia with a neighbouring peat dome that has been deforested, but not intentionally drained, in the Belait district of Brunei Darussalam, Borneo. We characterized the solid and dissolved organic matter collected from the two domes, through a combination of methods including elemental analysis, phenolic content and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigation of solid peat, as well as optical characterisation (absorbance, fluorescence) of dissolved organic matter (DOM). The peat had a high content of lignin, consistent with its origin from the Shorea albida trees on the domes. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the pore water was significantly greater in the deforested site (79.9  5.5 mg 1) than the pristine site (62.2  2.2 mg 1). The dissolved organic matter was richer in nitrogen and phenolics in the deforested site. The optical properties (Fluorescence Index) indicated a modification of DOM cycling in the deforested site (enhanced decomposition of the peat and fresh litter). Comparison of the solid peat composition between the two sites also suggests effects of deforestation: sulphur, nitrogen and phenolic contents were higher in the deforested site. Taken together, these observations are consistent with peat enhanced decomposition in the deforested site, even without engineered drainage.
40343599|This study addresses deep pore water chemistry in a permeable intertidal sand flat at the NW German coast. Sulphate, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients, and several terminal metabolic products were studied down to 5 m sediment depth. By extending the depth domain to several meters, insights into the functioning of deep sandy tidal flats were gained. Despite the dynamic sedimentological conditions in the study area, the general depth profiles obtained in the relatively young intertidal flat sediments of some metres depth are comparable to those determined in deep marine surface sediments. Besides diffusion and lithology which control pore water profiles in most marine surface sediments, biogeochemical processes are influenced by advection in the studied permeable intertidal flat sediments. This is supported by the model setup in which advection has to be implemented to reproduce pore water profiles. Water exchange at the sediment surface and in deeper sediment layers converts these permeable intertidal sediments into a "bio-reactor" where organic matter is recycled, and nutrients and DOC are released. At tidal flat margins, a hydraulic gradient is generated, which leads to water flow towards the creekbank. Deep nutrient-rich pore waters escaping at tidal flat margins during low tide presumably form a source of nutrients for the overlying water column in the study area. Significant correlations between the inorganic products of terminal metabolism NH and PO and sulphate depletion suggest sulphate reduction to be the dominant pathway of anaerobic carbon remineralisation. Pore water concentrations of sulphate, ammonium, and phosphate were used to elucidate the composition of organic matter degraded in the sediment. Calculated C: N and C: P ratios were supported by model results.
1469643|Explaining the nearly ubiquitous absence of nitrogen fixation by planktonic organisms in strongly nitrogen-limited estuaries presents a major challenge to aquatic ecologists. In freshwater lakes of moderate productivity, nitrogen limitation is seldom maintained for long since heterocystic, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria bloom, fix nitrogen, and alleviate the nitrogen limitation. In marked contrast to lakes, this behavior occurs in only a few estuaries worldwide. Primary production is limited by nitrogen in most temperate estuaries, yet no measurable planktonic nitrogen fixation occurs. In this paper, we present the hypothesis that the absence of planktonic nitrogen fixers from most estuaries is due to an interaction of bottom-up and top-down controls. The availability of Mo, a trace metal required for nitrogen fixation, is lower in estuaries than in freshwater lakes. This is not an absolute physiological constraint against the occurrence of nitrogen-fixing organisms, but the lower Mo availability may slow the growth rate of these organisms. The slower growth rate makes nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in estuaries more sensitive to mortality from grazing by zooplankton and benthic organisms. We use a simple, mechanistically based simulation model to explore this hypothesis. The model correctly predicts the timing of the formation of heterocystic, cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater lakes and the magnitude of the rate of nitrogen fixation. The model also correctly predicts that high zooplankton biomasses in freshwaters can partially suppress blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, even in strongly nitrogen-limited lakes. Further, the model indicates that a relatively small and environmentally realistic decrease in Mo availability, such as that which may occur in seawater compared to freshwaters due to sulfate inhibition of Mo assimilation, can suppress blooms of heterocystic cyanobacteria and prevent planktonic nitrogen fixation. For example, the model predicts that at a zooplankton biomass of 0.2 mg l<sup>-1</sup>, cyanobacteria will bloom and fix nitrogen in lakes but not in estuaries of full-strength seawater salinity because of the lower Mo availability. Thus, the model provides strong support for our hypothesis that bottom-up and top-down controls may interact to cause the absence of planktonic nitrogen fixation in most estuaries. The model also provides a basis for further exploration of this hypothesis in individual estuarine systems and correctly predicts that planktonic nitrogen fixation can occur in low salinity estuaries, such as the Baltic Sea, where Mo availability is greater than in higher salinity estuaries.
1469352|Nitrogen and phosphorus loads in the sub-tropical Richmond River estuary were quantified and material budgets were developed over two years of contrasting freshwater discharge. During both years >74% of the nitrogen and >84% of the phosphorus load entered the estuary during one month when flooding occurred in the catchment. Due to larger flood magnitude, loads during the 1995/96 year were 3.3 and 2.5 times greater than during the 1994/95 year for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively. During floods the estuarine basin was completely flushed of brackish water and the majority of the nutrient loads passed directly through the estuary. The nutrient load retained in the estuary during floods was inversely proportional to flood magnitude. Annual budgets show that >97% of the nutrient load entering the estuary was from diffuse catchment sources; precipitation, urban runoff, and sewage were negligible. Less than 2.5% of the nitrogen and <5.4% of the phosphorus loads entering the estuary were retained in sediments. During dry seasons the estuary became a net sink for nitrogen input from the ocean and the estuarine sediments remained a net source of phosphorus to the water column and ocean. The process of flood scouring is likely to be the cleansing mechanism responsible for maintaining water quality both on an annual basis and over the last 50 years and may also be responsible for potential nitrogen limitation. The sub-tropical Richmond River estuary contrasts with the majority of temperate systems of North America and Europe which typically have lower inter- and intra-annual nutrient load variability, longer and less variable flushing times, and greater nutrient retention.
1469852|Lake Victoria, the world's largest tropical freshwater lake, is an important resource, ecologically and economically. THg distribution in the northern parts of the lake are not well known, so to answer this gap, patterns in total mercury (THg) in water, soil and two dated sediment cores from northern Lake Victoria were determined. Water THg concentrations ranged from 0.7 to 5.8 ng/L, and there were no apparent differences observed between Napoleon and Winam Gulfs. Two precipitation samples had Hg concentrations of 7 and 31 ng/L. Surface soil samples collected from various agricultural sites around Jinja, Napoleon Gulf, have THg concentrations between 12.7 and 48.4 ng/g dry weight; they were correlated with organic carbon, total phosphorus and % clay. A near-shore core taken in Itome Bay in Napoleon Gulf, and an offshore core collected from the deepest part of the lake had similar THg concentrations and profiles (78 to 458 ng/g dry weight). The increase in THg concentration in the profiles of both cores began around 1960 and peaked around 1980. The similar sedimentary THg profiles and fluxes in the cores suggest that the THg sources to L. Victoria are primarily atmospheric, with some erosion inputs, and that equatorial African ecosystems are not exempt from the global increase in baseline THg concentrations.
4151463|Research in river-floodplain systems has emphasized the importance of nutrient delivery by floodwaters, but the mechanisms by which floods make nutrients available are rarely evaluated. Using a laboratory re-wetting experiment, we evaluated the alternative hypotheses that increased nutrient concentrations in riparian groundwater during flash floods are due to (HI) elevated nutrient concentrations in surface floodwaters entering the riparian zone or (H2) re-mobilization of nutrients from riparian soils. We sampled soils from the riparian zone of a 400 m reach of Sycamore Creek, AZ. Two sub-samples from each soil were re-wetted with a solution that mimicked the chemistry of floodwaters, with one subsample simultaneously treated with a biocide. We also measured structural characteristics of soils (texture, organic matter, moisture, and extractable nutrients) to investigate relationships between these characteristics and response to re-wetting. Riparian soils exhibited considerable variation in physical and chemical structure. Soil organic matter, moisture, and texture co-varied among samples. Re-wetting increased concentrations of nitrate and ammonium, and decreased SRP, relative to initial concentrations. Live soils were significantly lower in NO
1469596|The human induced input of reactive N into the global biosphere has increased to approximately 150 Tg N each year and is expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. The need to feed (125 Tg N) and to provide energy (25 Tg N) for the growing world population drives this trend. This increase in reactive N comes at, in some instances, significant costs to society through increased emissions of NOx, NH3, N2O and NO3- and deposition of NOy and NHx. In the atmosphere, increases in tropospheric ozone and acid deposition (NOy and NHx) have led to acidification of aquatic and soil systems and to reductions in forest and crop system production. Changes in aquatic systems as a result of nitrate leaching have led to decreased drinking water quality, eutrophication, hypoxia and decreases in aquatic plant diversity, for example. On the other hand, increased deposition of biologically available N may have increased forest biomass production and may have contributed to increased storage of atmospheric CO2 in plant and soils. Most importantly, synthetic production of fertilizer N has contributed greatly to the remarkable increase in food production that has taken place during the past 50 years. The development of policy to control unwanted reactive N release is difficult because much of the reactive N release is related to food and energy production and reactive N species can be transported great distances in the atmosphere and in aquatic systems. There are many possibilities for limiting reactive N emissions from fuel combustion, and in fact, great strides have been made during the past decades. Reducing the introduction of new reactive N and in curtailing the movement of this N in food production is even more difficult. The particular problem comes from the fact that most of the N that is introduced into the global food production system is not converted into usable product, but rather reenters the biosphere as a surplus. Global policy on N in agriculture is difficult because many countries need to increase food production to raise nutritional levels or to keep up with population growth, which may require increased use of N fertilizers. Although N cycling occurs at regional and global scales, policies are implemented and enforced at the national or provincial/state levels. Multinational efforts to control N loss to the environment are surely needed, but these efforts will require commitments from individual countries and the policy-makers within those countries.
20055260|The biogeochemical behavior of carbon in the forested watersheds of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) was analyzed in long-term studies. The largest pools of C in the reference watershed (W6) reside in mineral soil organic matter (43% of total ecosystem C) and living biomass (40.5%), with the remainder in surface detritus (14.5%). Repeated sampling indicated that none of these pools was changing significantly in the late-1990s, although high spatial variability precluded the detection of small changes in the soil organic matter pools, which are large; hence, net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in this 2nd growth forest was near zero ( about 20 g C/m-yr) and probably similar in magnitude to fluvial export of organic C. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of the forest declined by 24% between the late-1950s (462 g C/m-yr) and the late-1990s (354 g C/m-yr), illustrating age-related decline in forest NPP, effects of multiple stresses and unusual tree mortality, or both. Application of the simulation model PnET-II predicted 14% higher ANPP than was observed for 1996-1997, probably reflecting some unknown stresses. Fine litterfall flux (171 g C/m-yr) has not changed much since the late-1960s. Because of high annual variation, C flux in woody litterfall (including tree mortality) was not tightly constrained but averaged about 90 g C/m-yr. Carbon flux to soil organic matter in root turnover (128 g C/m-yr) was only about half as large as aboveground detritus. Balancing the soil C budget requires that large amounts of C (80 g C/m-yr) were transported from roots to rhizosphere carbon flux. Total soil respiration (TSR) ranged from 540 to 800 g C/m-yr across eight stands and decreased with increasing elevation within the northern hardwood forest near W6. The watershed-wide TSR was estimated as 660 g C/m-yr. Empirical measurements indicated that 58% of TSR occurred in the surface organic horizons and that root respiration comprised about 40% of TSR, most of the rest being microbial. Carbon flux directly associated with other heterotrophs in the HBEF was minor; for example, we estimated respiration of soil microarthropods, rodents, birds and moose at about 3, 5, 1 and 0.8 g C/m-yr, respectively, or in total less than 2% of NPP. Hence, the effects of other heterotrophs on C flux were primarily indirect, with the exception of occasional irruptions of folivorous insects. Hydrologic fluxes of C were significant in the watershed C budget, especially in comparison with NEP. Although atmospheric inputs (1.7 g C/m-yr) and streamflow outputs (2.7 g C/m-yr) were small, larger quantities of C were transported within the ecosystem and a more substantial fraction of dissolved C was transported from the soil as inorganic C and evaded from the stream as CO (4.0 g C/m-yr). Carbon pools and fluxes change rapidly in response to catastrophic disturbances such as forest harvest or major windthrow events. These changes are dominated by living vegetation and dead wood pools, including roots. If biomass removal does not accompany large-scale disturbance, the ecosystem is a large net source of C to the atmosphere (500-1200 g C/m-yr) for about a decade following disturbance and becomes a net sink about 15-20 years after disturbance; it remains a net sink of about 200-300 g C/m-yr for about 40 years before rapidly approaching steady state. Shifts in NPP and NEP associated with common small-scale or diffuse forest disturbances (e.g., forest declines, pathogen irruptions, ice storms) are brief and much less dramatic. Spatial and temporal patterns in C pools and fluxes in the mature forest at the HBEF reflect variation in environmental factors. Temperature and growing-season length undoubtedly constrain C fluxes at the HBEF; however, temperature effects on leaf respiration may largely offset the effects of growing season length on photosynthesis. Occasional severe droughts also affect C flux by reducing both photosynthesis and soil respiration. In younger stands nutrient availability strongly limits NPP, but the role of soil nutrient availability in limiting C flux in the mature forest is not known. A portion of the elevational variation of ANPP within the HBEF probably is associated with soil resource limitation; moreover, sites on more fertile soils exhibit 20-25% higher biomass and ANPP than the forest-wide average. Several prominent biotic influences on C pools and fluxes also are clear. Biomass and NPP of both the young and mature forest depend upon tree species composition as well as environment. Similarly, litter decay differs among tree species and forest types, and forest floor C accumulation is twice as great in the spruce--fir--birch forests at higher elevations than in the northern hardwood forests, partly because of inherently slow litter decay and partly because of cold temperatures. This contributes to spatial patterns in soil solution and streamwater dissolved organic carbon across the Hubbard Brook Valley. Wood decay varies markedly both among species and within species because of biochemical differences and probably differences in the decay fungi colonizing wood. Although C biogeochemistry at the HBEF is representative of mountainous terrain in the region, other sites will depart from the patterns described at the HBEF, due to differences in site history, especially agricultural use and fires during earlier logging periods. Our understanding of the C cycle in northern hardwood forests is most limited in the area of soil pool size changes, woody litter deposition and rhizosphere C flux processes.

1469882|This paper reports the results derived from radium isotopes of a submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) intercomparison in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. Radium isotope samples were collected from seepage meters, piezometers, and surface and deep ocean waters. Samples collected within the near-shore SGD experimental area were highly enriched in all four radium isotopes; offshore samples were selectively enriched. Samples collected from seepage meters were about a factor of 2-3 higher in radium activity compared to the overlying waters. Samples from piezometers, which sampled 1-4 meters below the sea bed were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher in radium isotopes than surface waters. The two long-lived Ra isotopes, <sup>228</sup>Ra and <sup>226</sup>Ra, provide convincing evidence that there are two sources of SGD to the study area: shallow seepage from the surficial aquifer and input from a deeper aquifer. A three end-member mixing model can describe the Ra distribution in these samples. The short-lived radium isotopes, <sup>223</sup>Ra and <sup>224</sup>Ra, were used to establish mixing rates for the near-shore study area. Mixing was retarded within 3 km of shore due to a strong salinity gradient. The product of the mixing rate and the offshore <sup>226</sup>Ra gradient established the <sup>226</sup>Ra flux. This flux must be balanced by Ra input from SGD. The flux of SGD within 200 m of shore based on the <sup>226</sup>Ra budget was 1.5 m<sup>3</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>. This flux agreed well with other estimates based on seepage meters and <sup>222</sup>Rn.
1469920|Nitrogen deposition, mineralisation, uptake and leaching were measured on a monthly basis in the field during 2 years in six forested stands on acidic soils under mountainous climate.

Neither general soil parameters, such as pH, soil type, base saturation and C:N ratio, nor deposition in throughfall or litterfall were simply related to the intensity of mineralisation and/or nitrification. When root uptake was not allowed, nitrate leaching increased by 11 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> at S45, 36 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> at S90 and between 69 and 91 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> at D20, D40, B150 and D60, in relation to the nitrification rates of each plot. From this data set and recent data from the literature, we suggest that: high nitrification and nitrate leaching in Douglas-fir soils was likely related to the former agricultural land use. High nitrification rate but very low nitrate leaching in the old beech soil was related to intense recycling of mineralised N by beech roots. Medium nitrification and nitrate leaching in the old spruce stand was related to the average level of N deposition and to the deposition and declining health of the stand. Very low nitrification and N leaching in the young spruce stand were considered representative of fast growing spruce plantations receiving low N deposition on acidic soils of ancient coniferous forests. Consequently, we suggest that past land use and fine root cycling (which is dependent on to tree species and health) should be taken into account to explain the variability in the relation between N deposition and leaching in forests.
1469658| We assessed a number of biomass and soil parameters in order to examine relationships among nutrient availability, forest productivity and vegetation patterns in two old-growth forested watersheds in a pristine montane landscape on Isla de Chilo, Chile. We selected watersheds in both gymnospermand angiosperm-dominated forests and determined tree species, d.b.h. and health for all trees > 2 cm d.b.h. in plots established at 50 m intervals. Soils were sampled at two depths in each plot and analyzed for total C and N, and for exchangeable Ca, K, Mg and resin-extractable P. Allometric relationships and vegetation nutrient concentrations were used to determine above-ground pools from the vegetation survey data. Growth rates were derived from increment core measures. Soil pools of most elements measured appear adequate to support forest growth indefinitely. Mineralized nitrogen, which is similar in quantity to the annual demand for nitrogen from the soil is the exception, consistent with the possibility of N limitation in two of the forest types studied. A third type, an evergreen broadleaved forest, appears to require substantially more nitrogen than would appear to be available from net mineralization measurements. Productivity per unit of nitrogen required from the soil is quite high, largely as a consequence of the evergreen habit of the species in these forests. Compared to other temperate montane forests in the Northern Hemisphere, nutrient pools and cycling characteristics were found to be mostly similar across forest types, in spite of considerable variation in vegetation and soils. 
1469122|Seasonal cycles of concentrations and microbial uptake of dissolved free amino acids and the polyamine, putrescine, were followed during summer stratification of a coastal salt pond. Stratification began in May and was clearly seen in profiles of temperature, salinity, pH and alkalinity. Primary production exhibited a mid-August maximum and the O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>S interface shoaled at that time. POC and phytopigments roughly followed the pattern of primary production. Cycling of putresince, like the amino acids, was strongly influenced by primary production and microbial decomposition. Putrescine concentration profiles appeared to follow the pattern of primary production more closely, while amino acids appeared to follow the pattern of microbial production. The absence of production of putrescine during the decomposition of dissolved ornithine and the correlation of putrescine concentration with primary production suggest a direct source from algae in the water column. Microbial uptake of amino acids and putrescine together accounted for 60-90% of the bacterial C production measured in oxic waters and almost 300% of that measured in the anoxic bottom layer. Since other organic carbon and nitrogen compounds are also being taken up, these data suggest that tracer uptake methods as we used them may overestimate the true microbial uptake rates, or release of other organic compounds by microbes occurs at the same time. Further work on carbon and nitrogen budgets is needed to resolve the apparent imbalance between organic C and N incorporation and bacterial production.
1468589|At Big Run Bog, a Sphagnum-dominated peatland in the unglaciated Appalachian Plateau of West Virginia, significant spatial variation in the physical and chemical properties of the peat and in surface and subsurface (30 cm deep) water chemistry was characterized. The top 40 cm of organic peat at Big Run Bog had average values for bulk density of 0.09 g cm<sup>-3</sup>, organic matter concentration of 77%, and volumetric water content of 88%. Changes in physical and chemical properties within the peat column as a function of depth contributed to different patterns of seasonal variation in the chemistry of surface and subsurface waters. Seasonal variation in water chemistry was related to temporal changes in plant uptake, organic matter decomposition and element mineralization, and to varying redox conditions associated with fluctuating water table levels. On the average, total Ca, Mg, and N concentrations in Big Run Bog peat were 33, 15, and 1050  mol g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively; exchangeable Ca and Mg concentrations were 45 and 14  eq g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Surface water pH averaged 4.0 and Ca<sup>++</sup> concentrations were less than 50  eq L<sup>-1</sup>. These chemical variables have all been used to distinguish bogs from fens. Physiographically, Big Run Bog is a minerotrophic fen because it receives inputs of water from the surrounding forested upland areas of its watershed. However, chemically, Big Run Bog is more similar to true ombrotrophic bogs than to minerotrophic fens.
25652632|The quantification of silicon (Si) uptake by tree species is a mandatory step to study the role of forest vegetations in the global cycle of Si. Forest tree species can impact the hydrological output of dissolved Si (DSi) through root induced weathering of silicates but also through Si uptake and restitution via litterfall. Here, monospecific stands of Douglas fir, Norway spruce, Black pine, European beech and oak established in identical soil and climate conditions were used to quantify Si uptake, immobilization and restitution. We measured the Si contents in various compartments of the soiltree system and we further studied the impact of the recycling of Si by forest trees on the DSi pool. Si is mainly accumulated in leaves and needles in comparison with other tree compartments (branches, stembark and stemwood). The immobilization of Si in tree biomass represents less than 15% of the total Si uptake. Annual Si uptake by oak and European beech stands is 18.5 and 23.3 kg ha year, respectively. Black pine has a very low annual Si uptake (2.3 kg ha year) in comparison with Douglas fir (30.6 kg ha year) and Norway spruce (43.5 kg ha year). The recycling of Si by forest trees plays a major role in the continental Si cycle since tree species greatly influence the uptake and restitution of Si. Moreover, we remark that the annual tree uptake is negatively correlated with the annual DSi output at 60 cm depth. The landocean fluxes of DSi are certainly influenced by geochemical processes such as weathering of primary minerals and formation of secondary minerals but also by biological processes such as root uptake.
1469980|Strontium isotope ratios (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr) of soil solids, soil cation extracts, irrigation water and plant material are used to determine strontium and therefore cation sources and fluxes in irrigated and natural soil-plant systems. Strontium isotopes of soil solids from four soil profiles (two irrigated vineyard soils and two 'natural' profiles from nearby reserves) show large differences between soil horizons with depth. These differences are not reflected in <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios of soil labile cations, which show both little variation down-profile and much lower ratios than soil solids. In the undisturbed, natural soil profiles, labile cation <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios are close to the ratio of modern seawater, indicating that solutes of marine origin from precipitation are the primary input of strontium (and calcium) to the labile cation pool. In the irrigated soil profiles, <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios of labile cations are consistently shifted towards that of the irrigation water. Mass-balance calculations using <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios of the different inputs to the labile cation pool indicate more than 90% of labile strontium is derived from precipitation solutes in unirrigated soils, and up to 44% from irrigation water solutes as an additional source in irrigated soils. The <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios of grapes grown in irrigated soils match precisely with those of the labile soil cations, demonstrating that cation nutrients are drawn wholly from the labile cation pool and have the same mix of precipitation, irrigation, and soil solid sources. The <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios of grapes grown in the irrigated soils may therefore vary over time depending on (1) the changing mix of irrigation water and local precipitation and (2) potential change to irrigation water. These findings suggest limitations to the use of strontium isotopes in the tracing of grapes and wines to their soil of origin.
1469425| Dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM) collected from rivers or groundwater feeding five estuaries along the east and west coasts of the USA were characterized with a variety of biogeochemical techniques and related to bioavailability to estuarine microbes. Surface water was sampled from the Columbia, Satilla, Susquehanna and Parker Rivers and groundwater was sampled from the Childs River. Several geochemical descriptors (percent organic matter of suspended particulate matter, C/N, lignin phenol content, ratio of vanillic acid to vanillin) suggested an ordering of the systems with respect to POM lability: Satilla < Parker < Columbia < Susquehanna. DOC concentrations in these systems ranged from <100 M for the Columbia River to >2000 M for the Satilla River. Elemental analysis of DOM concentrates (>1000 D) was used to predict organic matter composition and to calculate degree of substrate reduction using two different modeling approaches. Models predicted aliphatic carbon ranging between 43 and 60% and aromatic carbon between 26 and 36%, with aliphatic content lowest in the Satilla and highest in the Columbia River. The degree of substrate reduction of the organic matter concentrates followed a pattern similar to that for aliphatic C, being lowest in the Satilla (3.5) and highest in the Columbia (4.0). Extracellular enzyme activity varied broadly across the systems, but again ordered sites in the same way as did aliphatic content and degree of substrate reduction. Bacterial growth rates ranged from 1.3 ug mg<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> DOC in the Satilla to 1.7 ug mg<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> DOC in the Parker River. Bioassays confirmed patterns of dissolved organic matter lability predicted by the chemical models. Between 67% to 75% of the variation in bacterial growth could be explained by differences in organic matter composition. 
1469927| The retention of nutrients within an ecosystem depends on temporal and spatial synchrony between nutrient availability and nutrient uptake, and disruption of fine root processes can have dramatic impacts on nutrient retention within forest ecosystems. There is increasing evidence that overwinter climate can influence biogeochemical cycling belowground, perhaps by disrupting this synchrony. In this study, we experimentally reduced snow accumulation in northern hardwood forest plots to examine the effects of soil freezing on the dynamics of fine roots (< 1 mm diameter) measured using minirhizotrons. Snow removal treatment during the relatively mild winters of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 induced mild freezing temperatures (to -4 C) lasting approximately three months at shallow soil depths (to -30 cm) in sugar maple and yellow birch stands. This treatment resulted in elevated overwinter fine root mortality in treated compared to reference plots of both species, and led to an earlier peak in fine root production during the subsequent growing season. These shifts in fine root dynamics increased fine root turnover but were not large enough to significantly alter fine root biomass. No differences in morality response were found between species. Laboratory tests on potted tree seedlings exposed to controlled freezing regimes confirmed that mild freezing temperatures (to -5 C) were insufficient to directly injure winter-hardened fine roots of these species, suggesting that the marked response recorded in our forest plots was caused indirectly by mechanical damage to roots in frozen soil. Elevated fine root necromass in treated plots decomposed quickly, and may have contributed an excess flux of about 0.5 g N/m<sup>2</sup> yr, which is substantial relative to measurements of N fluxes from these plots. Our results suggest elevated overwinter mortality temporarily reduced fine root length in treatment plots and reduced plant uptake, thereby disrupting the temporal synchrony between nutrient availability and uptake and enhancing rates of nitrification. Increased frequency of soil freezing events, as may occur with global change, could alter fine root dynamics within the northern hardwood forest disrupting the normally tight coupling between nutrient mineralization and uptake. 
1469621|World-wide eutrophication of estuaries has made accurate estimation of land-derived nitrogen loads an important priority. In this paper we verify predictions of nitrogen loads made by the Waquoit Bay Nitrogen Loading Model (NLM). NLM is appropriate for watersheds with mixes of forested, agricultural, and residential land uses, and underlain by coarse unconsolidated sediments. NLM tracks the fate of nitrogen inputs by atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use, and wastewater disposal, and assigns losses of nitrogen from each source as the nitrogen is transported through the land use mosaic on the watershed surface, then through the underlying soils, vadose zones, and aquifers. We verified predictions of nitrogen loads by NLM in two independent ways. First, we compared NLM predictions to measured nitrogen loads in different subestuaries in the Waquoit Bay estuarine system. Nitrogen loads predicted by NLM were statistically indistinguishable from field-measured nitrogen loading rates. The fit of model predictions to measurements remained good across the wide range of nitrogen loads, and across a broad range in size (10-10,000 ha) of land parcels. NLM predictions were most precise when specific parcels were larger than 200 ha, and within factors of 2 for smaller parcels. Second, we used NLM to predict the percentage of nitrogen loads to estuaries contributed by wastewater, and compared this prediction to the  <sup>15</sup>N signature distinguishable from N derived from atmospheric or fertilizer sources. The greater the contribution of wastewater, the heavier the  <sup>15</sup>N value in groundwater. The significant linear relation between NLM predictions of percent wastewater contributions and stable isotopic signature corroborated the conclusion that model outputs provide a good match to empirical measurements. The good agreement obtained in both verification exercises suggests that NLM is an useful tool to address basic and applied questions about how land use patterns alter the fate of nitrogen traversing land ecosystems, and that NLM provides verified estimates of the land-derived nitrogen exports that transform receiving aquatic ecosystems.
20055197|Soil CO efflux is a major component of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of forest systems. Combining data from multiple researchers for larger-scale modeling and assessment will only be valid if their methodologies provide directly comparable results. We conducted a series of laboratory and field tests to assess the presence and magnitude of soil CO efflux measurement system  environment interactions. Laboratory comparisons were made with a dynamic, steady-state CO flux generation apparatus, wherein gas diffusion drove flux without creating pressure differentials through three artificial soil media of varying air-filled porosity. Under these conditions, two closed systems (Li-6400-09 and SRC-1) exhibited errors that were dependent on physical properties of the artificial media. The open system (ACES) underestimated CO flux. However, unlike the two other systems, the ACES results could be corrected with a single calibration equation that was unaffected by physical differences in artificial media. Both scale and rank changes occurred among the measurement systems across four sites. Our work clearly shows that soil CO efflux measurement system  environment interactions do occur and can substantially impact estimates of soil CO efflux. Until reliable calibration techniques are developed and applied, such interactions make direct comparison of published rates, and C budgets estimated using such rates, difficult.
20519818|While the amount of reactive nitrogen circulating at the global level has increased markedly in the last century, the effects of this increase are largely seen at the regional level due to interacting ecological and socio-economic factors. In contrast with most other regions of the world, Latin America and the Caribbean (LA-Ca) stand out due to the fact that the major input of reactive nitrogen (Nr) still occurs naturally via biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in natural ecosystems as opposed to anthropogenic inputs of synthetic fertilizer, fossil fuel combustion and cropping with leguminous species. Largely due to economic reasons, the consumption of fertilizer N in the LA-Ca region is still low in comparison with the average consumption of the world. However, the fertilizer N consumption is increasing at a much faster rate than that in developed regions of the world, like USA and Canada. The Nr production through BNF in cultivated plants that fix nitrogen (C-BNF) is 5 times lower than that occurring naturally in Latin America, but is still equivalent to 16% of the world C-BNF. The cultivation of nitrogen-fixing crop species in the LA-Ca region is also increasing, almost entirely due to the expansion of soybean fields in the central and northern regions of Brazil and the Pampa region of Argentina. Other anthropogenic activities in the region that contribute to an increase in the circulation of reactive nitrogen include the impact of biomass burning and urbanization. In the last decade, an average of 47,000 km per year of forests was burned in the LA-Ca region. The environmental impact of urban centers in the LA-Ca region has become very important, since an intense urbanization process is occurring in this region, at an intensity that far exceeds urban development in the northern hemisphere. The consequences of increased urbanization include increased emissions of
25652598|Today's questions concerning the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in soil fertility, ecosystem functioning and global change can only be addressed through knowledge of the controls on SOM stabilization and their interactions. Pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry (py-MBMS) provides a powerful and rapid means of assessing the biochemical composition of SOM. However, characterization of SOM composition alone is insufficient to predict its dynamic behavior. Chemical fractionation is frequently used to isolate more homogeneous SOM components, but the composition of fractions is frequently unknown. We characterized biochemical SOM composition in two previously studied soils from the USA, under contrasting land uses: cultivated agriculture and native vegetation. Bulk soils, as well as chemically isolated SOM fractions (humic acid, humin and non-acid hydrolysable), were analyzed using py-MBMS. Principal components analysis (PCA) showed distinct differences in the SOM composition of isolated fractions. Py-MBMS spectra and PCA loadings were dominated by low molecular weight fragments associated with peptides and other N-containing compounds. The py-MBMS spectra were similar for native whole-soil samples under different vegetation, while cultivation increased heterogeneity. An approach based on previously published data on marker signals also suggests the importance of peptides in distinguishing samples. While the approach described here represents significant progress in the characterization of changing SOM composition, a truly quantitative analysis will only be achieved using multiple internal standards and by correcting for inorganic interference during py-MBMS analysis. Overall, we have provided proof of principle that py-MBMS can be a powerful tool to understand the controls on SOM dynamics, and further method development is underway.
40647934|Sediment denitrification is a maj or pathway of fixed nitrogen loss from aquatic systems. Due to technical difficulties in measuring this process and its spatial and temporal variability, estimates of local, regional and global denitrification have to rely on a combination of measurements and models. Here we review approaches to describing denitrification in aquatic sediments, ranging from mechanistic diagenetic models to empirical parameterizations of nitrogen fluxes across the sediment-water interface. We also present a compilation of denitrification measurements and ancillary data for different aquatic systems, ranging from freshwater to marine. Based on this data compilation we reevaluate published parameterizations of denitrification. We recommend that future models of denitrification use (1) a combination of mechanistic diagenetic models and measurements where bottomwaters are temporally hypoxic or anoxic, and (2) the much simpler correlations between denitrification and sediment oxygen consumption for oxic bottom waters. For our data set, inclusion of bottom water oxygen and nitrate concentrations in a multivariate regression did not improve the statistical fit.
23359726|C, N and P are three of the most important elements used to build living beings, and their uptake from the environment is consequently essential for all organisms. We have reviewed the available studies on water, soils and organism elemental content ratios (stoichiometry) with the aim of identifying the general links between stoichiometry and the structure and function of organisms and ecosystems, in both aquatic and terrestrial contexts. Oceans have variable C:N:P ratios in coastal areas and a narrow range approximating the Redfield ratio in deep water and inner oceanic areas. Terrestrial ecosystems have a general trend towards an increase in soil and plant N:P ratios from cool and temperate to tropical ecosystems, but with great variation within each climatic area. The C:N:P content ratio (from now on C:N:P ratio) is more constrained in organisms than in the water and soil environments they inhabit. The capacity to adjust this ratio involves several mechanisms, from leaf reabsorption in plants to the control of excretion in animals. Several differences in C:N:P ratios are observed when comparing different taxa and ecosystems. For freshwater ecosystems, the growth rate hypothesis (GRH), which has consistent experimental support, states that low N:P supply determines trophic web structures by favoring organisms with a high growth rate. For terrestrial organisms, however, evidence not yet conclusive on the relevance of the GRH. Recent studies suggest that the N:P ratio could play a role, even in the evolution of the genomes of organisms. Further research is warranted to study the stoichiometry of different trophic levels under different C:N:P environment ratios in long-term ecosystem-scale studies. Other nutrients such as K or Fe should also be taken into account. Further assessment of the GRH requires more studies on the effects of C:N:P ratios on anabolic (growth), catabolic (respiration), storage and/or defensive allocation. Combining elemental stoichiometry with metabolomics and/or genomics should improve our understanding of the coupling of different levels of biological organization, from elemental composition to the structure and evolution of ecosystems, via cellular metabolism and nutrient cycling.

20519854|Several studies relating land cover to stream properties have used sample sizes of more than 100 watersheds, but the variance that they explain is moderate to low (R less than 50%), limiting the predictive value of these studies when their models are applied to watersheds that were not included in the models' development. We hypothesize that this is due to the increases in variation that occur with increases in sample size and in the geographic scales of the areas in which the watersheds are distributed. Land cover alone cannot explain all of that variation; more predictors must be considered. Conversely, models with high explicative power would require relatively small sample sizes distributed over small areas. This hypothesis was evaluated sampling 17 watersheds from southern Chile's Lake Region, for which we developed regressive models between land cover/watershed area/precipitation/geomorphology and stream properties (i.e., conductivity, temperature). With a maximum n = 15 watersheds, on a regional scale, a poorly explained variation in hydrologic variables (mean 37-49%) was obtained. The R increased slightly, to 45-52%, when precipitation was included as a predictor. In half of the cases analyzed, the models improved when geomorphology was considered as an additional predictor (60-66%), supporting our hypothesis. Furthermore, when our analysis was restricted to a narrower latitudinal span (n = 9), the R was much stronger (68-87%) when only land cover and watershed area were included as predictors. These percentages also increased when more predictors were incorporated. Nevertheless, a portion of unexplained variance remained that would require the consideration of more predictors, such as geology and edaphology. The documented trade-off provides evidence that argues against the spatial generality of land cover/stream property models.
1469357| The effects of phosphorus (P) enrichment on decomposition rates were measured in a P loading experiment conducted in an oligotrophic marsh in the northern Everglades, USA. In this study, eighteen 2.5 m<sup>2</sup> enclosures (mesocosms) were placed in a pristine open-water (slough) wetland and subjected weekly to 6 inorganic P loads; 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 g m<sup>-2</sup>g yr<sup>-1</sup>. Phosphorus accumulated rapidly in the benthic periphyton and unconsolidated detrital (benthic floc) layer and significantly higher P concentrations were recorded after 1 yr of P addition. In contrast, a significant increase in surface soil (0-3 cm) TP concentrations was measured in the surface soil layer only after 3 yr of loading at the highest dose. Plant litter and benthic floc/soil decomposition rates were measured using litter bags, containing sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense Crantz) leaves, and cotton (cellulose) strips, respectively. Litter bag weight losses were similar among treatments and averaged 30% at the end of the 3 yr study period. Litter N concentrations increased over time by an average of 80% at P loads < 1.6 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and by > 120% at P loads  1.6 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. In contrast, litter P concentrations declined up to 50% in the first 6 months in all P loads and only subsequently increased in the two highest P-loaded mesocosms. Cotton strip decay demonstrated that benthic floc and soil microbial activity increased within 5 mo of P addition with more significant treatment effects in the benthic than the soil layer. The influence of soil microbial transformations was shown in porewater chemistry changes. While porewater P levels remained close to background concentrations throughout the study, porewater NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased in response to P enrichment, suggesting that one significant effect of P enrichment in this oligotrophic peat system is enhanced nutrient regeneration. 
1469831|The distribution of nitrogen-transforming processes, and factors controlling their rates, were determined within the hyporheic zone of a lowland stream draining agricultural land. In the field, physicochemical parameters were measured along a 10 m-long hyporheic flow line between downwelling and upwelling zones. Sediment cores were retrieved from the stream bed surface, and from 20, 40 and 60 cm deep in each zone, and in the laboratory, water from the corresponding depth was percolated through each core at the natural flow rate. Concentrations of nitrogen species and oxygen were measured before and after flow through each core. Denitrification was measured using a <sup>15</sup>N-nitrate tracer. Shallow and downwelling zone samples were clearly distinct from deeper and upwelling zone samples in terms of physicochemical conditions, microbial processes and factors controlling nitrogen processing. Denitrification was highest in surface and downwelling zone cores, despite high oxygen levels, probably due to high pore-water nitrate concentrations in these cores and isolation of the denitrifying bacteria from oxygen in the bulk water by the hyporheic biofilms. Denitrification was limited by oxygen inhibition in the downwelling group, and by nitrate availability in the upwelling group. Strong evidence indicated that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, occurred in almost all cores, and outcompeted denitrification for nitrate. In contrast, nitrification was undetectable in all but two cores, probably because of intense competition for oxygen. Field patterns and lab experiments indicated that the hyporheic zone at this moderately N-rich site is a strong sink for nitrate, fitting current theories that predict where hyporheic zones are nitrate sinks or nitrate sources.
41410561|While rare globally, blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena are a recurring problem in a few estuaries, such as the Baltic Sea and several southern Australian estuaries. Here, we document recurring Nodularia spumigena Mertens blooms in the Gippsland Lakes, S. E. Australia; a temperate lagoon system with episodic, winter-spring dominated catchment inflows. Physico-chemical conditions exerted a strong influence over bloom development, with blooms consistently occurring at surface water salinities between 9 and 20 (average = 15), inorganic nitrogen concentrations < 0.4 M, and inorganic nitrogen to reactive phosphorus ratios < 5. There was a positive correlation between average annual chlorophyll a and total phosphorus (TP) load in years when there was no Nodularia bloom, but this relationship broke down in Nodularia bloom years, even though there was a strong correlation between in-lake TP and chlorophyll a during these years; this highlights the importance of internal sources of phosphorus to bloom development. Large catchment derived nitrate and nitrite (NO) inputs following wildfires and floods in 2007, led to high concentrations of NO within the surface waters of the Gippsland Lakes through the second half of 2007 and the start of 2008. We hypothesise that these high NO concentrations were a key factor leading to an unprecedented Synechococcus sp. bloom that developed in the austral summer of 2007-2008, despite conditions that would otherwise favour a Nodularia bloom.
40343751|The accumulation and biodgradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved and paniculate combined neutral sugars (DCNS, PCNS) were followed during a period of 22 days in experimental marine phytoplankton incubations. Five different growth regimes were established in llm 3 coastal mesocosms to test whether an alternate Redfield ratio with either N or P depletion and idiatom dominance would induce accumulation of refractory DOC (RDOC) and DCNS. The highest accumulation of DOC, DCNS and PCNS was found in the diatom dominated mesocosms. Sixteen percent of the newly accumulated DOC in the mesocosms with diatoms dominating could be explained by DCNS, while only 6% was explained in the mesocosms with few diatoms. PCNS composition was similar in all mesocosms and with dominance of glucose and mannose, while DCNS were more evenly distributed with the following mole percentages fucose 15, rhamnose 14, arabinose 6, galactose 27, glucose 20 and mannose 18%. The DCNS composition did not reflect the PCNS composition at any time during the experiment. Accumulated DCNS were quickly degraded and only 1% of the new RDOC was explained by DCNS. RDOC accumulated after day # 17 in the two mesocosms driven towards the most severe P limitation both with and without silicate. This shows that RDOC can be produced directly by the phytoplankton or indirectly in food web processes during the later stages of a bloom where the phytoplankton is P limited.
41490466|The two components of soil respiration, autotrophic respiration (from roots, mycorrhizal hyphae and associated microbes) and heterotrophic respiration (from decomposers), was separated in a root trenching experiment in a Norway spruce forest. In June 2003, cylinders (29.7 cm diameter) were inserted to 50 cm soil depth and respiration was measured both outside (control) and inside the trenched areas. The potential problems associated with the trenching treatment, increased decomposition of roots and ectomycorrhizal my celia and changed soil moisture conditions, were handled by empirical modelling. The model was calibrated with respiration, moisture and temperature data of 2004 from the trenched plots as a training set. We estimate that over the first 5 months after the trenching, 45% of respiration from the trenched plots was an artefact of the treatment. Of this, 29% was a water difference effect and 16% resulted from root and my celia decomposition. Autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration contributed to about 50% each of total soil respiration in the control plots averaged over the two growing seasons. We show that the potential problems with the trenching, decomposing roots and mycelia and soil moisture effects, can be handled by a modelling approach, which is an alternative to the sequential root harvesting technique.
1468787| The relative contribution of HNO<sub>3</sub> to precipitation acidity in eastern Canada has increased in recent years leading to some concern that the relative importance of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition in acidification of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems may increase. To gauge the extent of this impact, annual mass balances for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were calculated for several forested catchments and lakes in Ontario. Retention of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (R<sub>NH<sub>4</sub></sub>) by forested catchments was consistently high compared to retention of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (R<sub>NO<sub>3</sub></sub>) which was highly variable. Retention of inorganic nitrogen was influenced by catchment grade and areal water discharge. In lakes, the reciprocals of retention of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were linearly related to the ratio of lake mean depth to water residence time (z/; equal to areal water discharge), and retention did not appear to be a function of degree of acidification of the lakes. Net N consumption-based acidification of lakes, defined as the ratio of annual NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> mass to NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> mass consumption, was negatively correlated with z/ and N consumption-related acidification was most likely to occur when z/ was < 1.5 m yr<sup>-1</sup>. If retention mechanisms are unaffected by changes in deposition, changes in deposition will still result in changes in surface water concentrations although the changes will be of similar proportions. Therefore, 'NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> saturation' should not be defined by concentrations alone, but should be defined as decreasing long-term, average NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> retention in streams and lakes in response to long-term increases in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition. Analysis of survey data will be facilitated by grouping lakes and catchments according to similar characteristics. 
40343607|The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of N fertilization and the presence of N fixing leguminous trees on soil fluxes of greenhouse gases. For a one year period, we measured soil fluxes of nitrous oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO) and methane (CH), related soil parameters (temperature, water-filled pore space, mineral nitrogen content, N mineralization potential) and litterfall in two highly fertilized (250 kg N ha year) coffee cultivation: a monoculture (CM) and a culture shaded by the N fixing legume species Inga densiflora (CIn). Nitrogen fertilizer addition significantly influenced NO emissions with 84% of the annual NO emitted during the post fertilization periods, and temporarily increased soil respiration and decreased CH uptakes. The higher annual NO emissions from the shaded plantation (5.8  0.3 kg N ha year) when compared to that from the monoculture (4.3  0.1 kg N ha year) was related to the higher N input through litterfall (246  16 kg N ha year) and higher potential soil N mineralization rate (3.7  0.2 mg N kg d.w. d) in the shaded cultivation when compared to the monoculture (153  6.8 kg N ha year and 2.2  0.2 mg N kg d.w. d). This confirms that the presence of N fixing shade trees can increase NO emissions. Annual CO and CH fluxes of both systems were similar (8.4  2.6 and 7.5  2.3 t C-CO ha year, -1.1  1.5 and 3.3  1.1 kg C-CH ha year, respectively in the CIn and CM plantations) but, unexpectedly increased during the dry season.
40343636|Semiarid sagebrush ecosystems are being transformed by wildfire, rangeland improvement techniques, and exotic plant invasions, but the effects on ecosystem C and N dynamics are poorly understood. We compared ecosystem C and N pools to 1 m depth among historically grazed Wyoming big sagebrush, introduced perennial crested wheatgrass, and invasive annual cheatgrass communities, to examine whether the quantity and quality of plant inputs to soil differs among vegetation types. Natural abundance N isotope ratios were used to examine differences in ecosystem N balance. Sagebrush-dominated sites had greater C and N storage in plant biomass compared to perennial or annual grass systems, but this was predominantly due to woody biomass accumulation. Plant C and N inputs to soil were greatest for cheatgrass compared to sagebrush and crested wheatgrass systems, largely because of slower root turnover in perennial plants. The organic matter quality of roots and leaf litter (as C:N ratios) was similar among vegetation types, but lignin:N ratios were greater for sagebrush than grasses. While cheatgrass invasion has been predicted to result in net C loss and ecosystem degradation, we observed that surface soil organic C and N pools were greater in cheatgrass and crested wheatgrass than sagebrush-dominated sites. Greater biomass turnover in cheatgrass and crested wheatgrass versus sagebrush stands may result in faster rates of soil C and N cycling, with redistribution of actively cycled N towards the soil surface. Plant biomass and surface soil N ratios were enriched in cheatgrass and crested wheatgrass relative to sagebrush-dominated sites. Source pools of plant available N could become N enriched if faster soil N cycling rates lead to greater N trace gas losses. In the absence of wildfire, if cheatgrass invasion does lead to degradation of ecosystem function, this may be due to faster nutrient cycling and greater nutrient losses, rather than reduced organic matter inputs.
40647932|Denitrification is an important net sink for NO in streams, but direct measurements are limited and in situ controlling factors are not well known. We measured denitrification at multiple scales over a range of flow conditions and NO concentrations in streams draining agricultural land in the upper Mississippi River basin. Comparisons of reach-scale measurements (in-stream mass transport and tracer tests) with local-scale in situ measurements (pore-water profiles, benthic chambers) and laboratory data (sediment core microcosms) gave evidence for heterogeneity in factors affecting benthic denitrification both temporally (e.g., seasonal variation in NO concentrations and loads, flood-related disruption and re-growth of benthic communities and organic deposits) and spatially (e.g., local stream morphology and sediment characteristics). When expressed as vertical denitrification flux per unit area of streambed (U denit , in mol N m h), results of different methods for a given set of conditions commonly were in agreement within a factor of 2-3. At approximately constant temperature (~20  4C) and with minimal benthic disturbance, our aggregated data indicated an overall positive relation between U denit (~0-4,000 mol N m h) and stream NO concentration (~20-1,100 mol L) representing seasonal variation from spring high flow (high ) to late summer low flow (low NO). The temporal dependence of U denit on NO was less than first-order and could be described about equally well with power-law or saturation equations (e.g., for the unweighted dataset, U denit  26 * $U_{denit} \, \approx 26*[NO_3 ^ - ]^{0.44} $ or $U_{denit} \, \approx 640*[NO_3 ^ - ]/[180 + NO_3 ^ - ]^{0.54} $ ; for a partially weighted dataset, $U_{denit} \, \approx 14*[NO_3 ^ - ]^{0.54} \,or\,U_{denit} \approx 700*[NO_3 ^ - ]/[320 + NO_3 ^ - ]$ ). Similar parameters were derived from a recent spatial comparison of stream denitrification extending to lower NO concentrations (LINX2), and from the combined dataset from both studies over 3 orders of magnitude in NO concentration. Hypothetical models based on our results illustrate: (1) U denit was inversely related to denitrification rate constant (k1 denit , in day) and vertical transfer velocity (v f,denit, in m day) at seasonal and possibly event time scales; (2) although k1 denit was relatively large at low flow (low NO), its impact on annual loads was relatively small because higher concentrations and loads at high flow were not fully compensated by increases in U denit ; and (3) although NO assimilation and denitrification were linked through production of organic reactants, rates of NO loss by these processes may have been partially decoupled by changes in flow and sediment transport. Whereas k1 denit and v f,denit are linked implicitly with stream depth, NO concentration, and(or) NO load, estimates of U denit may be related more directly to field factors (including NO concentration) affecting denitrification rates in benthic sediments. Regional regressions and simulations of benthic denitrification in stream networks might be improved by including a non-linear relation between U denit and stream NO concentration and accounting for temporal variation.
40980894|Spatial and temporal changes in phosphorus (P) distribution, partitioning and mobility in the benthic cyanobacterial mat (CBM) were evaluated using sequential chemical fractionation. Total P (TP) content was extremely low, ranging from 0.025 to 0.1 mg g DW. Exchangeable and loosely bound P, which we consider to be mainly associated with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), constituted the most significant proportion of TP (up to 52%, 55 g g DW), followed by P associated with the authigenic apatites (up to 35% of TP or 18 g g DW). While we found virtually no exchange of P with the ambient environment, our results show that the partitioning of P forms within CBM is dependent on spatial and temporal fluctuations of physico-chemical parameters, mainly pH and dissolved oxygen. A conspicuous diurnal increase in the reactive, exchangeable and loosely bound P in the top CBM layers was observed. This observation has important ecological implications, as CBM microorganisms therefore have an increased possibility for P "luxury" uptake during the night. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that P in the organic fraction rises by as much as 53% in the upper layers during the night, indicating some form of cellular uptake. The P-binding potential of EPS also has ecological or biogeochemical consequences and should be considered in stoichiometrical studies where it represents potential danger for great overestimates of cellular P values or the nutritional status of cells.
40343538|Field-scale observations of two upland soils derived from contrasting granite and basalt bedrocks are presented to hypothesize that redox activity of rhizospheres exerts substantial effects on mineral dissolution and colloidal translocation in many upland soils. Rhizospheres are redox-active microsites and in the absence of O, oxidation of rhizodeposits can be coupled by reduction of redoxactive species such as Fe, a biogenic reduction that leads to Fe translocation and oxidation, accompanied by substantial proton flux. Not only do rhizogenic Fe-C redox cycles demonstrate a process by which the rhizosphere affects an environment well outside the near-root zone, but these redox processes are also hypothesized to be potent weathering systems, such that rhizogenic redox-reactions complement acid-and ligand-promoted reactions as major biogeochemical processes that control crustal weathering. The potential significance of Fe-C redox cycling is underscored by the deep and extensive rooting and mottling of upland subsoils across a wide range of plant communities, lithologies, and soil-moisture and temperature regimes.
23359715|The influence of the seasonal development of microplankton communities on the cycling of dimethylsulfide (DMS) and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) was investigated along a SouthNorth gradient (3659N) in the Northwest (NW) Atlantic Ocean. Three surveys allowed the sampling of surface mixed layer (SML) waters at stations extending from the subtropical gyre to the Greenland Current during May, July and October 2003. Pools and transformation rates of DMSP and DMS were quantified and related to prevailing physical and biochemical conditions, phytoplankton abundance and taxonomic composition, as well as bacterioplankton abundance and leucine uptake. The SouthNorth progression of the diatom bloom, a prominent feature in the NW Atlantic, did not influence the production of DMS whereas conditions in the N Atlantic Drift lead to a persistent bloom of DMSP-rich flagellate-dominated phytoplankton community and high net DMS production rates. Macroscale patterns of the observed variables were further explored using principal component analysis (PCA). The first axis of the PCA showed a strong association between the spatio-temporal distribution of DMSP and the abundance of several phytoplankton groups including dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes, as well as with microbial-mediated DMSPd consumption and yields and rates of the conversion of DMSP into DMS. The second axis revealed a strong association between concentrations of DMS and SML depth and photosynthetically active radiation, a result supporting the prominent role of solar radiation as a driver of DMS dynamics.
20519802|Humic acids (HA) contribute to soil fertility because of their chemical, physical, and biological properties. The origin of HAs in soils has puzzled scientists for decades, and what HAs are and what their origin is remain unclear. The isolation of HAs in plants, which have characteristics close to soil HAs, suggests the probable origin of soil-HA is the preservation of plant tissue, indicating biochemical origin. In this paper HA from maize plant at different stages of maturity is isolated, from which it was found that the evolution of this fraction depends on and is derived from cell wall formation. Evidence was also found that HA was above all composed of lignin and cutin residues, and was characterized by low surface area. After 8 months of incubation in both mineral-artificial and natural soils, humic acid isolated form maize plant could be recovered intact.
1469116| The formation of soil organic matter from grass residues was studied in a 34-year-old pot experiment with grass cultivation on loamy marl using pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS). For whole soils, the Py-FI mass spectra indicated clear changes in the molecular-chemical composition during SOM formation from grass residues. In particular, the enrichment of heterocyclic N-containing compounds with time was remarkable. For organomineral size fractions, even larger differences in the composition of SOM were found. The changes between the 13th and 34th experimental year are partly explained by a net transfer of phenols, lignin monomers und lignin dimers from medium silt to fine silt. Moreover, it is demonstrated that temperature-resolved Py-FIMS enables the determination of the thermal energy required for the evolution of individual compound classes which is a measure of the strength of humic- and organomineral bonds. At lower temperatures (<400C), the enrichment of thermally less stable and/or loosely bound organic matter with cultivation time in clay and fine silt is due to carbohydrates, N-containing compounds, phenols and lignin monomers. Shifts of evolution maxima toward a higher pyrolysis temperature (>400C) in clay, fine silt and medium silt are explained by a higher thermal stability of humic and/or organomineral bonds of lignin dimers, alkylaromatics and lipids, that developed during the last two decades of the experiment. 
41490469|Allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter deposited in benthic sediments are mineralized by microbial communities, resulting in release of nutrients to the water column. Lakes with different trophic states may have sediments with different carbon and nutrient concentration with consequently different microbial communities. Microbial diversity of surface sediments of three subtropical lakes of different trophic state was investigated by measuring catabolic response to a wide variety of carbon-substrates. Basal carbon dioxide and methane production rates were highest in Lake Apopka (hypereutrophic), followed by Lake Annie (oligo-mesotrophic) and Lake Okeechobee (eutrophic) sediments. The oligo-mesotrophic Lake Annie showed the highest metabolic quotient (qCO ; proportion of basal respiration per unit of microbial biomass, 0.008  0.001) indicating inefficient use of energy. The low qCO found in Lake Apopka sediment indicated higher efficiency in using energy. Lake Okeechobee sediments had intermediary values of qCO (M9 0.005  0.001; M17 0.006  0.0003; KR 0.004  0.001) as compared with other lakes (lake Apopka 0.004  0.14). Lake Apopka's sediment catabolic diversity was higher than that observed in other sediments. Addition of organic electron donors to sediment samples from all lakes stimulated heterotrophic activity; however, the extent of the response varied greatly and was related to microbial biomass. The hypereutrophic Lake Apopka sediments had the highest respiration per unit of microbial biomass with the addition of electron donors indicating that these sediments respired most of the C added. These results showed that sediments with different biogeochemical properties had microbial communities with distinct catabolic responses to addition of the C sources.
1468831|The pH of sediments underlying acidified lake waters does not necessarily reflect the acidification of the water. Profiles of sediments in Lake Anna, Virginia showed interstitial pH values between 6.0 and 7.0 within the top 4 cm, even though the sediments are constantly exposed to overlying waters with pH values as low as 3.5. The amount of acidity neutralized by sediment processes is 2 orders of magnitude greater than previously reported observations. The results indicate that caution must be used in drawing conclusions about sediment biogeochemical processes based on the pH of overlying waters.
20519773|Emissions of CO from soils make up one of the largest fluxes in the global C cycle, thus small changes in soil respiration may have large impacts on global C cycling. Anthropogenic additions of CO to the atmosphere are expected to alter soil carbon cycling, an important component of the global carbon budget. As part of the Duke Forest Free-Air CO Enrichment (FACE) experiment, we examined how forest growth at elevated (+ 200 ppmv) atmospheric CO concentration affects soil CO dynamics over 7 years of continuous enrichment. Soil respiration, soil CO concentrations, and the isotopic signature of soil CO were measured monthly throughout the 7 years of treatment. Estimated annual rates of soil CO efflux have been significantly higher in the elevated plots in every year of the study, but over the last 5 years the magnitude of the CO enrichment effect on soil CO efflux has declined. Gas well samples indicate that over 7 years fumigation has led to sustained increases in soil CO concentrations and depletion in the C of soil CO at all but the shallowest soil depths.
24715101|Tidal freshwater wetlands are sensitive to sea level rise and increased salinity, although little information is known about the impact of salinification on nutrient biogeochemistry in tidal freshwater forested wetlands. We quantified soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization using seasonal in situ incubations of modified resin cores along spatial gradients of chronic salinification (from continuously freshwater tidal forest to salt impacted tidal forest to oligohaline marsh) and in hummocks and hollows of the continuously freshwater tidal forest along the blackwater Waccamaw River and alluvial Savannah River. Salinification increased rates of net N and P mineralization fluxes and turnover in tidal freshwater forested wetland soils, most likely through tree stress and senescence (for N) and conversion to oligohaline marsh (for P). Stimulation of N and P mineralization by chronic salinification was apparently unrelated to inputs of sulfate (for N and P) or direct effects of increased soil conductivity (for N). In addition, the tidal wetland soils of the alluvial river mineralized more P relative to N than the blackwater river. Finally, hummocks had much greater nitrification fluxes than hollows at the continuously freshwater tidal forested wetland sites. These findings add to knowledge of the responses of tidal freshwater ecosystems to sea level rise and salinification that is necessary to predict the consequences of state changes in coastal ecosystem structure and function due to global change, including potential impacts on estuarine eutrophication.
1469336|Building on the concept of plants as ecosystem engineers, and on published information on effects of particular plant species on soils, we review the evidence that such effects can provide a positive feedback to such plants. Based on case studies involving dune formation by Marram grass, N supply by N<sub>2</sub>-fixing plants, depression of N availability by ericaceous plants, 'islands of fertility' in deserts, mull- and mor-forming temperate forest trees, and formation of peatbogs, as well as similar other cases, we conclude that there is strong evidence for plant-soil feedbacks in a variety of ecosystems. We argue, moreover, that these feedbacks could have played a role in the evolution of the plant species in question. These ideas are based mainly on correlative observations, and need further testing.
1468497|Chemical and mineralogical studies of forest soils from six sites in the northeastern and southeastern United States indicate that soil in the immediate vicinity of roots and fine root masses may show marked differences in physical characteristics, mineralogy and weathering compared to the bulk of the forest soil. Examination of rhizosphere and rhizoplane soils revealed that mineral grains within these zones are affected mechanically, chemically and mineralogically by the invading root bodies. In SEM/EDS analyses, phyllosilicate grains adjacent to roots commonly aligned with their long axis tangential to the root surface. Numerous mineral grains were also observed for which the edge abutting a root surface was significantly more fractured than the rest of the grain. Both the alignment and fracturing of mineral grains by growing roots may influence pedogenic processes within the rhizosphere by exposing more mineral surface to weathering in the root-zone microenvironment. Chemical interactions between roots and rhizosphere minerals included precipitation of amorphous aluminium oxides, opaline and amorphous silica, and calcium oxalate within the cells of mature roots and possible preferential dissolution of mineral grains adjacent to root bodies. Mineralogical analyses using X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques indicated that kaolin minerals in some rhizosphere samples had a higher thermal stability than kaolin in the surrounding bulk forest soil. In addition, XRD analyses of clay minerals from one of the southeastern sites showed abundant muscovite in rhizoplane soil adhering to root surfaces whereas both muscovite and degraded mica were present in the immediately surrounding rhizosphere soil. This difference in mineral assemblages may be due to either K-enrichment in rhizoplane soil solutions or the preferential dissolution of biotite at the root-soil interface.
1468499|Forest soils are thought to be an important sink for atmospheric methane. To evaluate methane consumption. <sup>14</sup>C-labeled methane was added to the headspace of intact soil cores collected from a mixed mesophytic forest and from a red spruce forest located in the central Appalachian Mountains. Both soils consumed the added methane at initially high rates that decreased as the methane mixing ratio of the air decreased. The mixed mesophytic forest soil consumed an average of 2 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> versus 1 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> for the spruce forest soil. The addition of acetylene to the headspace completely suppressed methane consumption by the soils, suggesting that an aerobic methane-consuming microorganism mediated the process. At both forest sites, methane mixing ratios in soil air spaces were greater than that in the air overlying the soil surface, indicating that these soils had the ability to produce methane. Models of methane emission from forest soils to the atmosphere must represent methane flux as the balance between production and consumption of methane, which are controlled by very different factors.
1468767|Sulphur in agricultural soils occurs in organic and inorganic forms, with organic S accounting for > 95% of the total S. Analysis of a wide range of soils shows that from 25 to 75% of the organic S in soils is HI-reducible, from 7 to 30% is C-bonded, and from 11 to 22% is unidentified S. Nitrogen is associated with S in soil organic matter in a ratio of about 8: 1, although the extreme ratios may vary from 5: 1 to 13: 1. Laboratory studies showed that humus S is depleted faster than humus N. Mineralization of S in crop residues varied with type of crop residue and soil studied. The amounts of S fertilizers (gypsum, elemental S, and sulfuric acid) used in the United States in 1981 and 1982 were 1.9 10<sup>6</sup> and 1.5 10<sup>6</sup> tons, respectively. Of the total amount used in 1982, 3, 5, 20, and 71% were used in the West North Central, Mountain, South Atlantic, and Pacific regions, respectively. A survey of S deposition at about 100 sites in the United States and many other sites in Canada in 1980 showed that annual addition by precipitation in North America ranged from 0.5 to slightly above 10 kg/ha. The usual ranges of values in concentrations and spatial rates of N, P, and S in precipitation is well within the ranges of these elements in natural waters. Atmospheric sources are important components in meeting crops S requirements and should be considered in benefit-cost analyses relating to S emissions.
25652630|We compared extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) of microbial assemblages in river sediments at 447 sites along the Upper Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio Rivers with sediment and water chemistry, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfate, and catchment land uses. The sites represented five unique river reachesimpounded and unimpounded reaches of the Upper Mississippi River, the upper and lower reaches of the Missouri River, and the entire Ohio River. Land use and river chemistry varied significantly between rivers and reaches. There was more agriculture in the two Upper Mississippi River reaches, and this was reflected in higher nutrient concentrations at sites in these reaches. EEA was highest in the two Upper Mississippi River reaches, followed by the lower Missouri River reach. EEA was generally lowest in the upper Missouri River reach. Canonical correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between EEA and the suite of water and sediment chemistry variables, and the percent of the catchment in anthropogenically dominated land uses, including agriculture and urban development. Nutrient ratios of the waters and sediments suggested carbon (C), nitrogen (N), or phosphorus (P) limitation at a large number of sites in each reach. C-limitation was most pronounced in the unimpounded Mississippi River and lower Missouri River reaches; N-limitation was prevalent in the two Missouri River reaches; and P-limitation dominated the Ohio River. Linking microbial enzyme activities to regional-scale anthropogenic stressors in these large river ecosystems suggests that microbial enzyme regulation of carbon and nutrient dynamics may be sensitive indicators of anthropogenic nutrient and carbon loading.
1468751|Budgets for chlorophyll a and selected degradation products were constructed during summer stratification in 1984 and 1985 in two lakes. In Paul Lake, the reference ecosystem, pigment sedimentation showed no significant interannual differences. In Tuesday Lake, fish manipulations in May 1985 changed the zooplankton from an assemblage of Bosmina and small cyclopoids to one of large cladoceran grazers. Sedimentation of pigments, especially the grazing indicator pheophorbide a, increased significantly as the grazer assemblage changed. Mean grazer size was positively related to pheophorbide deposition rate in both lakes. Results of this whole-lake experiment indicate that major changes in lake food webs alter pigment deposition rates.
1469072|There is great interest in understanding how rangeland management practices affect the long-term sustainability of California oak woodland ecosystems through their influence on nutrient cycling. This study examines the effects of oak trees and low to moderate intensity grazing on soil properties and nutrient pools in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii H.&A.) woodland in the Sierra Nevada foothills of northern California. Four combinations of vegetation and management were investigated: oak with grazing, oak without grazing, open grasslands with grazing, and open grasslands without grazing. Results indicate that oak trees create islands of enhanced fertility through organic matter incorporation and nutrient cycling. Compared to adjacent grasslands, soils beneath the oak canopy have a lower bulk density, higher pH, and greater concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, total and available P, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, especially in the upper soil horizons (0-35 cm). In contrast, the light grazing utilized at this site had minimal effects on soil properties which included an increase in the bulk density of the surface horizon and an increase in available P throughout the entire soil profile. While low to moderate intensity grazing has little effect at this study site, there could be much larger impacts under the more intensive grazing practices utilized on many rangelands. The lack of oak regeneration and oak tree removal to enhance forage production may eventually lead to large losses of nutrients and soil fertility from these ecosystems. Results of this study have important implications for predicting how management practices may potentially affect oak regeneration, water quality, and ecosystem sustainability.
20456586|We conducted a 6-year field manipulation drought experiment in an evergreen Quercus ilex forest where we simulated the drought predicted by GCM and ecophysiological models for the coming decades (an average of 15% soil moisture reduction). We thereby tested the hypothesis that enhanced drought will change Ca, Fe, Mg, Mo and S availability, concentrations and accumulation patterns in Mediterranean ecosystems. The strongest effects of drought occurred in the soil. Drought increased the total soil concentrations of S, the soil extract concentrations of Fe, Mg and S, the Mg saturation in the soil exchangeable complex and tended to increase the percentage base saturation of the soil exchangeable complex. These increased soil concentrations were related to a decrease of plant uptake capacity and not to an increase of soil enzyme activity, which in fact decreased under drier conditions. Drought increased leaf Mg concentrations in the three dominant species although only significantly in Quercus ilex and Arbutus unedo (20 and 14%, respectively). In contrast, drought tended to decrease Ca in Phillyrea latifolia (18%) and Ca and Fe concentrations in the wood of all three species. Drought increased Ca and Fe concentrations in the roots of Quercus ilex (26 and 127%). There was a slight general trend to decrease total biomass accumulation of nutrients that depend on water flux such as Mg, Fe and S. This effect was related to a decrease of soil moisture that reduced soil flow, and to a decrease in photosynthetic capacity, sap flow, transpiration and growth, and therefore plant uptake capacity under drought observed in Quercus ilex and Arbutus unedo. On the contrary, drought increased Mo accumulation in aboveground biomass in Phillyrea latifolia and reduced Mo accumulation in Arbutus unedo by reducing growth and wood Mo concentrations (51%). Phillyrea latifolia showed a great capacity to adapt to drier conditions, with no decrease in growth, an increase of Mo uptake capacity and a decrease in leaf Ca concentration, which was related to a decrease in transpiration under drought. The results indicate asymmetrical changes in species capacity to accumulate these elements, which are likely to produce changes in inter-specific competitive relations among dominant plant species and in their nutritional quality as food sources. The results also indicate that drought tended to decrease nutrient content in aboveground biomass, mainly through the decrease in growth and transpiration of the most sensitive species and caused an increase in the availability of these nutrients in soil. Thus, drought decreased the ecosystem's capacity to retain Mg, Fe and S, facilitating their loss in torrential rainfalls.
24715112|Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO) has increased since the pre-industrial period and is predicted to continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century. The ocean is a sink for atmospheric CO and increased CO concentration will change the carbonate equilibrium of seawater and result in lower carbonate ion concentration and lower pH. This may affect the entire marine biota but in particular calcifying organisms. In this study we investigated the effect of increased CO on the virus host interaction of Emiliania huxleyi as a calcifying organism and of Phaeocystis poucheti as a non- calcifying organism. Both algae were grown in laboratory controlled conditions under past (280 ppmv), present (350 ppmv) and future (700 ppmv) CO concentrations with and without added virus. Increased CO had a negative effect on the growth rate of P. pouchetii, but not of E. huxleyi. No impact was found on viral lysis of P. pouchetii while increased burst size and slightly delayed lysis was observed for E. huxleyi with increased CO. We conclude that this short time study could not confirm earlier reports and our hypothesis of a negative effect of high CO on E. huxleyi growth and E. huxleyi virus production.
40980881|The Jizera Mountains area is affected by natural and anthropogenic acidification processes. The effect of acidification is reflected by presence of elevated amount of different Al forms in soil horizons. Changes of water extractable forms of Al (total A1HO, species: A1(X) , A1(Y) and A1) and other soil characteristics (e. g. DOC, pH) were investigated in forest soils from April to October 2008. Seasonal changes of Al forms were identified in organic F and H soil horizons. No significant effect of the soil type on Al forms was documented. Nevertheless, influence of vegetation cover (beech and spruce forest, clear-cut area) on A1(X) , A1(Y) forms was proved. The results show that binding and mobility of Al forms are controlled mostly by pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
20456390|The composition of phenols and other aromatic compounds in organic and mineral soil horizons and their respective source vegetation from different climatic zones of the Canadian Prairies were analyzed using CuO oxidation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to investigate the stage of lignin degradation. Parameters based on the CuO oxidation products were calculated for the soils and corresponding vegetation to determine the lignin sources and to monitor the lignin degradation. In addition to the widely used lignin monomer parameters, parameters resulting from lignin-derived phenolic dimers are used for the first time to assess lignin degradation in soils. The composition of lignin-derived phenols (S/V, C/V) in soil closely matches the composition observed in their respective source plants (grass, Aspen, Pine) reflecting the preservation of characteristic lignin patterns in soils. Degradation parameters based on lignin phenols and benzenes derived from tannins or other phenolic biomolecules indicate a progressive degradation from the vegetation to the soil horizons. In addition to commonly used lignin monomer indicators, parameters based on the lignin dimers are applied. Lignin degradation is found to be lowest in the Pine forest, intermediate in the grassland soils and highest in the Aspen-grassland transition soil. Degradation parameters based on non-lignin aromatic derivatives (3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, benzenepolycarboxylic acids) demonstrate a similar trend. The lignin from samples in the cooler climate (Black Chernozems) is observed to be more oxidized than in the soils from the warmer climate (Brown Chernozems) suggesting that abiotic processes may be in involved in the alteration of lignin and other phenolic biomolecules in soils. The results indicate that the comparative analysis of CuO oxidation products of soils and source vegetation is a valuable tool to assess the sources and degradation of lignin in soils.
1469843|The effects of disturbance on the biogeochemical processes that affect the sulfur (S) cycle in forested ecosystems are important, but have been studied in only a few locations. In this investigation, the mechanisms that caused large decreases in stream SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations after clearcutting a small forested catchment in the Catskill Mountains of southeastern New York in 1997 were identified through an examination of pH and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in soil solutions, bulk deposition of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in throughfall collectors, adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in buried soil bags, and spatial variations in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in shallow groundwater. The load of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-S in stream water during the first 2 years after clearcutting was about 2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> less than the background value of 8-10 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>. The 10 and 19% decrease in net throughfall flux of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-S during the 2nd and 3rd year after the clearcut, respectively, reflects reduced dry deposition of S after removal of the canopy, but this decrease accounts for 0 and 43%, respectively, of the decrease in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> load in streamflow for these 2 years. The pH of B-horizon soil water decreased from 4.5 to 4.0 within 8 months after the clearcut, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations decreased from 45  mol L<sup>-1</sup> to less than 20  mol L<sup>-1</sup> during this time. A strong correlation between SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations and pH values <latex>$(r^{2}=0.71,p<0.01)$</latex> in B-horizon soil water during the post-harvest period (1997-1999) reflects increased SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption in response to soil acidification. Sulfate concentrations in groundwater from 21 spatially distributed wells were inversely related to a topographic index that served as a surrogate for soil wetness; thus, providing additional evidence that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption was the dominant cause of the decreased SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in the stream after clearcutting. These results are consistent with those from a 1985 whole-tree harvest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire in which increased SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption resulting from decreased soil pH was the primary cause of decreased SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations in stream water.
40343744|Sediment reduction is frequently proposed to increase available phosphorus (P) but several studies found also decreases. Another important factor for P liberation is the pH. We investigated the relative importance of Eh and pH on P cycling in reforested mangroves. Sediment P compounds, pH and Eh were analysed over depth along five transects of two areas in the Saigon River Delta and compared with leaf P levels. A three-dimensional spatial approach was used to investigate pH and Eh effects on P compound distribution at different sediment depth and locate layers of predominant P uptake. Along an inundation gradient, submergence durations of 254 to 2 days per year caused a large Eh gradient within the top 20 cm, whereas Eh response was small within 20-45 cm depth. At individual layers, a correlation between Eh and Al/Fe-P was only found in the upper depth interval (0-20 cm). No significant effect of Eh or Al/Fe-P on Morgan-P (available P) was detected. Minor effects on P composition changes by the Eh were caused through generally strongly reduced sediment at deeper layers (> 20 cm). In contrast, pH variations produced extreme differences in both, Ca-P and available P content at layers of apparently predominant P uptake (> 20 cm). As available P was correlated with Ca-P (p < 0.001), leaf P (P < 0.001) and pH (non linear correlation) it is likely that the pH sensitive Ca-P fraction is a more effective source for mangrove tree growth than A1/Fe-P. The predominant pH effect on P uptake within these reforested mangroves differs from a proposed reduction-governed P cycling in wetlands.
1469602|We used the critical load (CL) concept to calculate ecosystem response to acid deposition in East Asia. The calculation of critical loads to assess the sensitivity of ecosystems to acidic deposition was made using a biogeochemical approach, which took into consideration both rates of biogeochemical cycling and temperature responses. On the basis of these data the soil-biogeochemical mapping has been carried out for the area of East Asia and the CL values for acid-forming compounds have been calculated using modified steady-state mass balance (SSMB) equations. In the north-eastern ecosystems of the Asian part of Russia these values of critical loads for N [CL(N)] and S [CL(S)] compounds are shown to be less than in Europe due to peculiarities of climate, soil and vegetation. The minimum values of both CL(N) and CL(S) are <50 eq/ha/yr (which occur in 8.3% and 40.5% of this area for N and S, correspondingly) and the maximum values are >300 eq/ha/yr. These values are occasionally lower than for corresponding European ecosystems. For the south-eastern ecosystems of the northern part of Thailand the minimum values are <200 eq/ha/yr and maximum values are >700 eq/ha/yr. The minimum CL values (<200 eq/ha/yr) occur in more than 75% of the studied Thai area.
1469687|Human activities have greatly altered the nitrogen (N) cycle, accelerating the rate of N fixation in landscapes and delivery of N to water bodies. To examine relationships between anthropogenic N inputs and riverine N export, we constructed budgets describing N inputs and losses for 16 catchments, which encompass a range of climatic variability and are major drainages to the coast of the North Atlantic Ocean along a latitudinal profile from Maine to Virginia. Using data from the early 1990's, we quantified inputs of N to each catchment from atmospheric deposition, application of nitrogenous fertilizers, biological nitrogen fixation, and import of N in agricultural products (food and feed). We compared these inputs with N losses from the system in riverine export. The importance of the relative sources varies widely by catchment and is related to land use. Net atmospheric deposition was the largest N source (>60%) to the forested basins of northern New England (e.g. Penobscot and Kennebec); net import of N in food was the largest source of N to the more populated regions of southern New England (e.g. Charles & Blackstone); and agricultural inputs were the dominant N sources in the Mid-Atlantic region (e.g. Schuylkill & Potomac). Over the combined area of the catchments, net atmospheric deposition was the largest single source input (31%), followed by net imports of N in food and feed (25%), fixation in agricultural lands (24%), fertilizer use (15%), and fixation in forests (5%). The combined effect of fertilizer use, fixation in crop lands, and animal feed imports makes agriculture the largest overall source of N. Riverine export of N is well correlated with N inputs, but it accounts for only a fraction (25%) of the total N inputs. This work provides an understanding of the sources of N in landscapes, and highlights how human activities impact N cycling in the northeast region.
1469237|Fourteen lichens, 10 green algal lichens and four cyanolichens, as well as a cyanobacterium emitted significant quantities of H<sub>2</sub>S (0.01-0.04 pmol g dw<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and DMS (0.005-0.025 pmol g dw<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), but were sinks for COS (0.015-0.14 pmol g dw<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). In contrast, exchange of CH<sub>3</sub>SH and CS<sub>2</sub> were sporatic and inconsistent. Although some interspecific variation occurred for the first three gases, exchange rates were relatively uniform and were not influenced by irradiance conditions. In contrast to DMS and H<sub>2</sub>S emission, COS uptake was strongly influenced by degree of thallus hydration. Because lichen dominated systems cover extensive terrestrial habitats, COS uptake is potentially important in the world's sulfur budget.
20456568|Slight differences in the chemical behavior of germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si) during soil weathering enable Ge/Si ratios to be used as a tracer of Si pathways. Mineral weathering and biogenic silicon cycling are the primary modifiers of Ge/Si ratios, but knowledge of the biogenic cycling component is based on relatively few studies. We conducted two sets of greenhouse experiments in order to better quantify the range and variability in Ge discrimination by plants. Graminoid species commonly found in North American grassland systems, Agropyron smithii, Schizachyrium scoparium, and Andropogon gerardii were grown under controlled hydroponic environmental conditions. Silicon leaf contents were positively correlated with solution Si and ambient temperature but not with nutrient solution pH, electrical conductivity, or species. The Ge/Si ratio incorporated into phytoliths shows a distribution coefficient
1468511|Biogenic silica concentration (BSi) in sediment cores from the Great Lakes is evaluated as an estimate of siliceous microfossil abundance. A significant linear relationship was found between measured BSi and diatom valve abundance for sediment cores from the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Michigan and Lake Superior and between measured BSi and diatom biovolume for Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior but not for Lake Ontario. Diatom silica predicted from diatom species abundance and an estimated silica content per cell in the Lake Erie cores accounted for 117% and 103% of measured BSi, respectively. By contrast, predicted diatom silica could only account for 28% of measured BSi in the Lake Michigan core and only 25% in the Lake Superior core. A few large diatoms with a large silica content per cell comprised a major portion of predicted diatom silica in all cores. The discrepancy between chemically measured BSi and the silica predicted from diatoms in the Lake Michigan and Lake Superior cores was partially due to the inability of the regression model, used to estimate diatom silica content, to account for different degrees of silicification in the diatom asemblages from the more dissolved silica rich Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.
1469886|Coastal zone managers need to factor submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in their integration. SGD provides a pathway for the transfer of freshwater, and its dissolved chemical burden, from the land to the coastal ocean. SGD reduces salinities and provides nutrients to specialized coastal habitats. It also can be a pollutant source, often undetected, causing eutrophication and triggering nuisance algal blooms. Despite its importance, SGD remains somewhat of a mystery in most places because it is usually unseen and difficult to measure. SGD has been directly measured at only about a hundred sites worldwide. A typology generated by the Land-Ocean Interaction in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) Project is one of the few tools globally available to coastal resource managers for identifying areas in their jurisdiction where SGD may be a confounding process. (LOICZ is a core project of the International Geosphere/Biosphere Programme.) Of the hundreds of globally distributed parameters in the LOICZ typology, a SGD subset of potentially relevant parameters may be culled. A quantitative combination of the relevant hydrological parameters can serve as a proxy for the SGD conditions not directly measured. Web-LOICZ View, geospatial software then provides an automated approach to clustering these data into groups of locations that have similar characteristics. It permits selection of variables, of the number of clusters desired, and of the clustering criteria, and provides means of testing predictive results against independent variables. Information on the occurrence of a variety of SGD indicators can then be incorporated into regional clustering analysis. With such tools, coastal managers can focus attention on the most likely sites of SGD in their jurisdiction and design the necessary measurement and modeling programs needed for integrated management.
40343616|To help evaluate effects of Mississippi River inputs to sustainability of coastal Louisiana ecosystems, we compared porewater and substrate quality of organic-rich Panicum hemitomon freshwater marshes inundated by river water annually for more than 30 years (Penchant basin, PB) or not during the same time (Barataria basin, BB). In the marshes receiving river water the soil environment was more reduced, the organic substrate was more decomposed and accumulated more sulfur. The porewater dissolved ammonium and orthophosphate concentrations were an order of magnitude higher and sulfide and alkalinity concentrations were more than twice as high in PB compared with BB marshes. The pH was higher and dissolved iron concentrations were more than an order of magnitude lower in PB marshes than in BB marshes. The influx of nutrientrich river water did not enhance end-of-year aboveground standing biomass or vertical accretion rates of the shallow substrate. The differences in porewater chemistry and substrate quality are reasonably linked to the long-term influx of river water through biogeochemical processes and transformations involving alkalinity, nitrate and sulfate. The key factor is the continual replenishment of alkalinity, nitrate and sulfate via overland flow during high river stage each year for several weeks to more than 6 months. This leads to a reducing soil environment, pooling of the phytotoxin sulfide and inorganic nutrients in porewater, and internally generated alkalinity. Organic matter decomposition is enhanced under these conditions and root mats degraded. The more decomposed root mat makes these marshes more susceptible to erosion during infrequent highenergy events (for example hurricanes) and regular low-energy events, such as tides and the passage of weather fronts. Our findings were unexpected and, if generally applicable, suggest that river diversions may not be the beneficial mitigating agent of wetland restoration and conservation that they are anticipated to be.
1469836|Clear-cutting considerably alters the flow of nutrients through the forest ecosystem. These changes are reflected in soil solution concentrations and fluxes. The effects of clear-cutting (stems only) on the fluxes of water soluble phosphorus (P), sulphur (S) and base cations (Ca, Mg and K) through a podzolic soil were studied in a Norway spruce dominated mixed boreal forest in eastern Finland. Bulk deposition, total throughfall (throughfall + stemflow) and soil percolate from below the organic (O), eluvial (E) and illuvial (B) horizons were collected for 4 years before and for 3 years after cutting. Annual deposition loads (kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) to the forest floor were less after clear-cutting, averaging 1.7 S, 0.84 Ca, 0.14 Mg, 0.64 K and 0.10 P. Before cutting, the loads were 4.6 S, 2.7 Ca, 0.70 Mg, 6.2 K and 0.20 P. Annual fluxes of total S and sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) from below the O-horizon were also lower (33%) after clear-cutting, total S averaging 2.0 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, the flux from below the B-horizon also diminished after clear-cutting. The flux of total P (mainly inorganic) from below the O-horizon increased threefold (6.9 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>; sum over the 3-year period) compared to period before cutting. The fluxes of base cations from below the O-horizon increased twofold. The flux of K<sup>+</sup> from below the O- and E-horizons was most strongly correlated with that of phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) and those of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> with the DOC flux. Increased fluxes of P and base cations to the mineral soil generated only slightly increased fluxes from below the B-horizon. The retention of base cations and P in the mineral soil indicates there was little change in leaching to ground and surface waters after clear-cutting.
24715190|The significance of the various carbon cycling pathways in driving the sharp sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ) observed at many locations along continental margins is still a topic of debate. Unraveling these processes is important to our understanding of the carbon cycle in general and to evaluate whether the location of this front can be used to infer present and past methane fluxes from deep reservoirs (e.g., gas hydrate). Here we report the pore water data from the second Ulleung Basin Gas Hydrate Expedition and on the results of a box model that balances solute fluxes among different carbon pools and satisfies the observed isotopic signatures. Our analysis identifies a secondary methanogenesis pathway within the SMTZ, whereby 2535 % of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) produced by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is consumed by CO reduction (CR). To balance this DIC consumption, a comparable rate of organic matter degradation becomes necessary, which in turn consumes a significant amount of sulfate. The fraction of sulfate consumed by AOM ranges from 70 to 90 %. Whereas a simple mass balance would suggest a one to one relationship between sulfate and methane fluxes; our isotopic considerations show that methane flux estimates based solely on sulfate data may be in error by as much as 30 %. Furthermore, the carbon cycling within the SMTZ is fueled by a significant contribution (1040 %) of methane produced by CR just below the SMTZ. Therefore sulfate gradient cannot necessarily be used to infer methane contributions from gas hydrate reservoirs that may lay tens to hundreds of meters below the SMTZ.
41490428|Shallow fresh water bodies in peat areas are important contributors to greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. In this study we determined the magnitude of CH and CO fluxes from 12 water bodies in Dutch wetlands during the summer season and studied the factors that might regulate emissions of CH and CO from these lakes and ditches. The lakes and ditches acted as CO and CH sources of emissions to the atmosphere; the fluxes from the ditches were significantly larger than the fluxes from the lakes. The mean greenhouse gas flux from ditches and lakes amounted to 129.1  8.2 (mean  SE) and 61.5  7.1 mg m h for CO and 33.7  9.3 and 3.9  1.6 mg mg m h for CH4, respectively. In most water bodies CH4 was the dominant greenhouse gas in terms of warming potential. Trophic status of the water and the sediment was an important factor regulating emissions. By using multiple linear regression 87% of the variation in CH could be explained by PO concentration in the sediment and Fe concentration in the water, and 89% of the CO flux could be explained by depth, EC and pH of the water. Decreasing the nutrient loads and input of organic substrates to ditches and lakes by for example reducing application of fertilizers and manure within the catchments and decreasing upward seepage of nutrient rich water from the surrounding area will likely reduce summer emissions of CO and CH from these water bodies.
40343540|The effects of natural hydrological fluctuations on the nature and bioavailability of soil phosphorus (P) in relation to iron (Fe) and aluminum (A1) chemistry and root mass were studied along a flooded tropical forest gradient in Mapire river, Venezuela. Soil samples were collected following a complete natural hydroperiod: end of the dry season (May 2004), end of the rainy season (November 2004) and end of the subsequent dry season (May 2005), and from three zones subjected to different flooding intensities: MAX, MED and MIN zones inundated for 8, 5 and 2 months per year respectively. The results showed that flood induced the increase of resin-Pi in the MAX zone, but not in the MED and MIN zones. Flood in the soil of the MAX zone also induced the increase of the NaOH-Pi fraction, which removes inorganic P sorbed onto secondary Fe and Al minerals. Changes in this redox-sensitive P form can be considered indirect evidence that P in the MAX zone can be released from the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide. This field study also showed that along the flooded forest gradient, fine root mass declined during the flood event. However, such decline was more pronounced in the MIN zone than in the MAX zone. In this zone fine root mass was higher than in the other zones.
1469627|To understand the importance of plants in structuring the vertical distributions of soil nutrients, we explored nutrient distributions in the top meter of soil for more than 10,000 profiles across a range of ecological conditions. Hypothesizing that vertical nutrient distributions are dominated by plant cycling relative to leaching, weathering dissolution, and atmospheric deposition, we examined three predictions: (1) that the nutrients that are most limiting for plants would have the shallowest average distributions across ecosystems, (2) that the vertical distribution of a limiting nutrient would be shallower as the nutrient became more scarce, and (3) that along a gradient of soil types with increasing weathering-leaching intensity, limiting nutrients would be relatively more abundant due to preferential cycling by plants. Globally, the ranking of vertical distributions among nutrients was shallowest to deepest in the following order: P > K > Ca > Mg > Na = Cl = SO<sub>4</sub>. Nutrients strongly cycled by plants, such as P and K, were more concentrated in the topsoil (upper 20 cm) than were nutrients usually less limiting for plants such as Na and Cl. The topsoil concentrations of all nutrients except Na were higher in the soil profiles where the elements were more scarce. Along a gradient of weathering-leaching intensity (Aridisols to Mollisols to Ultisols), total base saturation decreased but the relative contribution of exchangeable K<sup>+</sup> to base saturation increased. These patterns are difficult to explain without considering the upward transport of nutrients by plant uptake and cycling. Shallower distributions for P and K, together with negative associations between abundance and topsoil accumulation, support the idea that plant cycling exerts a dominant control on the vertical distribution of the most limiting elements for plants (those required in high amounts in relation to soil supply). Plant characteristics like tissue stoichiometry, biomass cycling rates, above- and belowground allocation, root distributions, and maximum rooting depth may all play an important role in shaping nutrient profiles. Such vertical patterns yield insight into the patterns and processes of nutrient cycling through time.
1468775|We examined photopigment degradation and transformation in sediment microcosms that received different detrital source materials (planktonic, littoral, terrestrial) in the presence or absence of amphidpods (Gammarus sp.). Additions of realistic quantities of particulate organic matter resulted in detectable changes in pigment concentration and composition despite insignificant changes in total organic matter. The transformation of chlorophyll a to total phaeophorbide was significantly higher in all high quality (high nitrogen) detritus treatments containing amphipods. The highest production of phaeophorbide was in the higher quality detritus (blue-green algae, Anabaena cylindrica, and macrophyte, Vallisneria americana) when compared to red maple (Acer rubrum). Phaeophytin formation was not related to amphipod grazing and thus may be determined more by microbial heterotrophic processes. The degradation product of the carotenoid lutein, lutein 5,6 expoxide, was formed in all treatments. Phaeopigment composition can be used to infer differences in heterotrophic activity and will help in the interpretation of photopigment distribution in field samples.
1469015|The knowledge of the biodegradation rates is essential to studies of the biogeochemistry and ecology of aquatic systems. It helps us to quantify the production and uptake rates of chemical components and their recycling, and to understand the mechanisms and rates of organic matter accumulation in sediments. Experimental studies of biodegradation processes in six types of mineralized skeletons were performed in shallow-marine waters of Calvi Bay, Corsica and in estuarine waters of Roscoff, Brittany. Three types of mollusk shells, sea urchin skeletal plates, crab cuticle and fish vertebrae were exposed to oxic and anoxic conditions over periods of 15 days to 30 months. After recovery of the substrates, protein assays, bacterial counts and organic carbon analyses were performed. Quantitative protein assays and bacterial counts indicate that biodegradation of mineralized skeletal structures occurs at a slower rate in anoxic conditions than in oxic conditions. Bacterial analysis showed that in anoxic environment, less than 0.5% of the consumed organic matter is converted into bacterial biomass. The aerobic biodegradation rate was positively correlated with the organic content of the skeletons. Anoxic biodegradation of skeletons occurred at much slower rates in estuarine sediments than in shallow marine sediments. Preservation of skeletal structures in estuarine conditions appears to be correlated with the abundance of dissolved organic matter rather than with high sedimentation rates.
20055213|This study gives an insight into the source of organic carbon and nitrogen in the Godavari river and its tributaries, the yield of organic carbon from the catchment, seasonal variability in their concentration and the ultimate flux of organic and inorganic carbon into the Bay of Bengal. Particulate organic carbon/particulate organic nitrogen (POC/PON or C/N) ratios revealed that the dominant source of organic matter in the high season is from the soil (C/N = 8-14), while in the rest of the seasons, the river-derived (in situ) phytoplankton is the major source (C/N = 1-8). Amount of organic materials carried from the lower catchment and flood plains to the oceans during the high season are 3 to 91 times higher than in the moderate and low seasons. Large-scale erosion and deforestation in the catchment has led to higher net yield of organic carbon in the Godavari catchment when compared to other major world rivers. The total flux of POC, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the Godavari river to the Bay of Bengal is estimated as 756  10 and 2520  10 g
40980887|Stream water chemistry in two headwater streams draining two small, adjacent catchments in Bispgrden, central Sweden was studied during the 2003 and 2004 growing seasons. The two catchments closely resemble each other in regard to size, shape and drainage density, with the major difference found in the area of wetland lining the streambeds. The emphasis of the study was to investigate the stream water chemistry of these closely resembling catchments, regarding the quality and quantity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its influence on the concentrations of di-and tri valent cations. The streams showed significant differences in the content and size distribution of DOC and in the distribution of cations between the different size fractions. For both streams the high flow events induced by precipitation influenced the chemistry of the streams through increase of organic matter and its associated cations. Fanbergsbcken, with relatively low pH and high DOC concentration, had a greater amount of high molecular mass (HMM) DOC to which approximately 75% of Al and Fe and about 50% of Ca and Mg were associated. Grbergsbcken, with a higher pH and lower DOC level, had approximately 65% of Al, 40% of Fe and 30% of Ca and Mg associated to its HMM DOC fraction. Sixteen different low molecular mass organic acids were found in the stream water, of which oxalic and lactic acid were present in the highest concentrations.
23359732|Over the past three decades, Narragansett Bay has undergone various ecological changes, including significant decreases in water column chlorophyll a concentrations, benthic oxygen uptake, and benthic nutrient regeneration rates. To add to this portrait of change, we measured the net flux of N 2 across the sedimentwater interface over an annual cycle using the N 2 /Ar technique at seven sites in the bay for comparison with measurements made decades ago. Net denitrifi cation rates ranged from about 1090 mol N 2 N m -2 h -1 over the year. Denitrification rates were not significantly different among sites and had no clear correlation with temperature. Net nitrogen fixation (-5 to -650 mol N 2 N m -2 h -1 ) was measured at three sites and only observed in summer (JuneAugust). Neither denitrification nor nitrogen fixation exhibited a consistent relationship with sediment oxygen demand or with fluxes of nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, total dissolved inorganic nitrogen, or dissolved inorganic phosphate across all stations. In contrast to the mid-bay historical site where denitrification rates have declined, denitrification rates in the Providence River Estuary have not changed significantly over the past 30 years.
40800617|Methane emissions from aquatic environments depend on methane formation (MF) and methane oxidation (MO) rates. One important question is to what extent increased temperatures will affect the balance between MF and MO. We measured potential MF and MO rates simultaneously at 4,10,20 and 30C in sediment from eight different lakes representing typical boreal and northern temperate lake types. Potential MF rates ranged between 0.002 and 3.99 mol CH gd.w. day, potential MO rates ranged from 0.01 to 0.39 CH gd.w. day. The potential MF rates were sensitive to temperature and increased 10 to 100 fold over the temperature interval studied. MF also differed between lakes and was correlated to sediment water content, percent of organic material and C:N ratio. Potential MO did not depend on temperature or sediment characteristics but was instead well explained by MF rates at the in situ temperature. It implies that elevated temperatures will enhance MF rates which may cause increased methane release from sediments until MO increases as well, as a response to higher methane levels.
40343557|Climate change models predict that the snowpacks of temperate forests will develop later and be shallower resulting in a higher propensity for soil freezing. In the northern most island of Japan, Hokkaido, snowpack depth decreases from west to east. This snowpack depth gradient provided a unique opportunity to test the effects of variable snowpack and soil freezing on N biogeochemistry. The Shibecha Northern Catchment in Shibecha Experimental Forest, eastern Hokkaido had deciduous trees and a mean annual snowpack of 0.7 m while the M3 catchment in Uryu Experimental Forest, western Hokkaido had mixed deciduous and coniferous tree species and a mean annual snowpack of 2.0 m. We conducted a field study (October 2004-April 2005) to determine if differences in Shibecha and Uryu soil extractable N,N mineralization, and nitrification were controlled by the variability in soil freezing during winter or tree species composition that affected the quality of the forest floor. The mixed deciduous and coniferous trees forming the Uryu forest floor had a higher C: N ratio (25.0 vs. 22.4 at Shibecha), higher lignin: N ratio (15 vs. 8.8), and higher lignin concentrations (0.28 vs. 0.18 g ligning g). These differences in forest floor quality contributed to higher net N mineralization and nitrification in Shibecha compared to Uryu. In Shibecha, soil remained frozen for the entire study. For Uryu, except for an early period with cold temperatures and no snow, the soil generally remained unfrozen. As a result of the early winter cold period and soil freezing, extractable soil
41410553|Chloride (C1) has often been assumed to be relatively unreactive in forest ecosystems, and is frequently used as a conservative tracer to calculate fluxes of water and other ions. Recently, however, several studies have detailed cycling of C1 in vegetation and soils. In this study C1 budgets are compiled from 32 catchment studies to determine the extent to which C1 is conserved in the passage through forest ecosystems. Chloride budgets from these sites vary from net retention (input > output) to net release (output > input). In the overall data set, including those sites with very high inputs of seasalt C1, there was a strong correspondence between inputs and outputs. However, sites with low C1 deposition (< 6 kg ha  year) consistently showed net release of C1, suggesting an internal source or a declining internal pool. The results indicate that C1 may be a conservative ion in sites with high C1 deposition, but in sites with low deposition C1 may not be conservative. We discuss the possible causes of the C1 imbalance and reasons why C1 may not be conservative in ecosystem functions.
1468990|Nitrogen supply is often assumed to limit marine primary production. A global analysis of total nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) molar ratios shows that total N:P is low (<16:1) in some estuarine and coastal ecosystems, but up to 100:1 in open oceans. This implies that elements other than N may limit marine production, except in human impacted, estuarine or coastal ecosystems. This pattern may reconcile conflicting enrichment studies, because N addition frequently increases phytoplankton growth where total N:P is expected to be low, but P, Fe, or Si augment phytoplankton growth in waters where total N:P is high. Comparison of total N:P stoichiometry between marine and freshwaters yields a model of the form of the aquatic N:P cycle.
1469640|Yields of total fixed nitrogen and nitrogen fractions are summarized for thirty-one watersheds in which anthropogenic disturbance of the nitrogen cycle, either through land use or atmospheric deposition, is negligible or slight. These yields are taken as representative of background conditions over a broad range of watershed areas, elevations, and vegetation types. The data set focuses on watersheds of the American tropics, but also includes information on the Gambia River (Africa) and some small watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California. For the tropical watersheds, total nitrogen yield averages 5.1 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>. On average, 30% of the total is particulate and 70% is dissolved. Of the dissolved fraction, an average of 50% is organic and 50% is inorganic, of which 20% is ammonium and 80% is nitrate. Yields are substantially lower than previously estimated for background conditions. Yields of all nitrogen fractions are strongly related to runoff, which also explains a large percentage of variance in yield of total nitrogen (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.85). For total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions, yield increases at about two-thirds the rate of runoff; concentration decreases as runoff increases. There is a secondary but significant positive relationship between elevation and yield of DIN. Ratios DON/TDN and PN/TN both are related to watershed area rather than runoff; DON/TDN decreases and PN/TN increases toward higher stream orders. The analysis suggests for tropical watersheds the existence of mechanisms promoting strong homeostasis in the yield of N and its fractions for a given moisture regime, as well as predictable downstream change in proportionate representation N fractions. Yields and concentrations for small tropical watersheds are much larger than for the few temperate ones with which comparisons are possible.
1468560|In regions with airborne contaminants and large snowpacks, there is concern over the impact that snowmelt chemical "pulses" -- periods of sharp increase in meltwater solute concentration -- could have on aquatic resources during spring runoff. A major variable in determining such an effect is the flow path of snowmelt solutes to the stream or lake. From December 1988, to late April 1989, the quality and quantity of precipitation, snowmelt, soil solution and streamwater were measured in a 176-ha gauged watershed on the south shore of Lake Superior. The main objectives were to (1) examine the change in flow path meltwaters take to the stream during distinct winter and spring hydrologic periods, (2) quantify ecosystem-level ion budgets prior to, during, and following snowmelt, and (3) examine if streamwater chemistry might be a sensitive indicator of change in ecosystem flow paths. Prior to peak snowmelt, groundwater made up 80% of stream discharge. During peak snowmelt, the groundwater level rose to the soil surface resulting in lateral water movement through near-surface macropores and as overland flow. Near the end of snowmelt, meltwaters exerted a piston action on deeper soil solution again increasing its relative contribution to streamwater discharge. Net groundwater drawdown during the study resulted in streamwater discharge about equal to precipitation inputs. Unfrozen soils and brief mid-winter thaws resulted in steady snowmelt throughout early and mid-winter. The snowpack lost > 50% of most ions prior to the period of major snowmelt and high stream discharge in late March and early April. Snowmelt and streamwater NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> pulses occurred before the period of overland flow and peak streamwater discharge (April 4-24). During overland flow, stream discharge of total N, P, DOC, and AI peaked. Nutrient budgets computed for distinct hydrologic periods were much more helpful in explaining ecosystem pathways and processes than were changes in solute concentration. For the study period, watershed base cation (C<sub>B</sub>) discharge was 23 times input and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> discharge exceeded input by 42%. H<sup>+</sup> was the most strongly conserved ion with output <0.2% of input. Also conserved were NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> with only 1.4% of input leaving the ecosystem and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> with output equal to 9.4% of input.
25652626|Seasonal and diurnal variations of instream NO-N concentration oscillations were studied through high-frequency measurements of stream-water's physical, chemical parameters (in-stream NO-N concentration, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH) and hydrometeorological variables (stream discharge, solar radiation) under hydrologically stable conditions. The study was carried out in 2006, within the 42 km forested Pade stream watershed in the southwestern part of Slovenia, which is characterized by distinctive hydrogeological settings (flysch) and climate conditions (transitional area between the Mediterranean and continental climate). Fine temporal data resolution (15-min interval) enabled identification of the factors responsible for seasonal variability in the diurnal pattern of the streamwater NO-N concentrations versus seasonal and diurnal behavior of meteorological and other water chemistry constituents. The observed seasonal variability of in-stream NO-N daily oscillations indicates the important role of primary production uptake, particularly during seasons when deciduous vegetation is dormant and light levels in the stream are high. Highest daily NO-N concentration amplitudes (0.3 mg/l-N) and daily changes in the NO-N flux (0.40.5 g/s-N) were observed in spring; the NO-N concentration oscillations in summer showed a considerably smaller effect of the in-stream uptake (maximum NO-N daily concentration amplitude 0.1 mg/l-N; daily change in the NO-N flux 0.02 g/s-N). Seasonal shifts in the timing of daily maximum (up to 6 h) and minimum NO-N concentrations (between 1 and 3 h) provided some additional indications of seasonal changes in the in-stream primary production uptake and its relation to the terrestrial component of the forested watershed.
20055295|The biogeochemical cycling of sulfur (S) was studied during the 2000 snowmelt at Sleepers River Research Watershed in northeastern Vermont, USA using a hydrochemical and multi-isotope approach.

20456576|A stochastic biogeochemical model has been developed to simulate the transformation and degradation of natural organic matter (NOM) using an agent-based algorithm which treats each molecule as a separate and potentially unique entity. Molecules react when a pseudo-random number is lower than the calculated reaction probability in a given time step; repeated time steps simulate the transformation of precursor molecules into a complex NOM assemblage. The data for each molecule--elemental and functional group composition--can be used to calculate many properties directly and exactly for each molecule in the assemblage, e.g., molecular weight (MW), fraction of aromatic C (Ar), and charge at pH 7 (Z). Empirical quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) are developed which permit the estimation of thermodynamic quantities
25652620|We conducted over four months a short-term laboratory incubation experiment to find the best prediction parameters (i.e. initial chemical characteristics) to explain differences in microbial respiration rates and mineral N (DIN) release in different litter in an acidified spruce forest. In addition, we wanted to find the link between the activity of key extracellular ligninolytic enzymes, phenoloxidases (PhOx) and peroxidases (Perox), microbial respiration and composition of fungal and bacterial communities. Samples of spruce needles (Picea abies) and litter of four dominant understorey vegetation; lady fern (Athyrium alpestre), blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), reedgrass (Calamagrostis villosa) and hair grass (Avenella flexuosa), were collected in 2005, 2006 and 2007 from six sites located in watersheds of two glacial lakes (Plesne Lake and Certovo Lake) in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic. Litter samples were incubated at 0 and 10 C in laboratory controlled conditions for 90 days. Activities of PhOx and PerOx, and C mineralization rate were measured regularly each 14 days. Litter quality characteristics and endophytic microbial community structure, based on 16SrDNA-DGGE fingerprint of bacteria and ITS-DGGE of fungi, were determined at the beginning and end of litter incubation. Our results showed a close correlation of phenolics/P OX with DIN release (r > 0.74, p < 0.001). Using multivariate analyses, P OX seems to play an important role in the change of litter fungal and bacterial community composition. At 0 C the fungal and bacterial communities of reedgrass and blueberry litter changed in relation to P OX and Perox activity, while at 10 C the fungal communities after the incubation were additionally affected by the phenolics/N TOT and phenolics/P TOT ratios.
1468705| Micrographs from two semi-arid grassland soils -- a cold temperate Mollisol (Chernozem) from western Canada and a hot Alfisol (Savannah Ochrosol) from northern Ghana -- were examined by light and electron microscopy. Soil samples were stained with ruthenium red to show microbial polysaccharides. The stained soils were partially dispersed in water and subsamples of all particles and aggregates (< 50 m) were examined by light microscopy. Subsamples containing mineral particles < 5 m as well as larger organic particles and aggregates of low density were observed by electron microscopy and analyzed with an electron microprobe (EDXRA). The ruthenium red stain adequately stained organic material for light and transmission electron microscopy and appeared to be relatively specific for polysaccharides of fungal and bacterial origin. This allowed the study of organo-mineral and microbial mineral associations in microaggregates, and pointed to the importance of organic matter and microbes in the mechanisms of aggregate formation and stabilization and structure in soils. 
1469175|Litterbag experiments were carried out in five forest ecosystems in the Netherlands to study weight loss and nitrogen dynamics during the first two years of decomposition of leaf and needle litter. All forests were characterized by a relatively high atmospheric nitrogen input by throughfall, ranging from 22-55 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Correlation analysis of all seven leaf and needle litters revealed no significant relation between the measured litter quality indices (nitrogen and lignin concentration, lignin-to-nitrogen ratio) and the decomposition rate. A significant linear relation was found between initial lignin-to-nitrogen ratio and critical nitrogen concentration, suggesting an effect of litter quality on nitrogen dynamics. Comparison of the decomposition of oak leaves in a nitrogen-limited and a nitrogen-saturated forest suggested an increased nitrogen availability. The differences in capacities to retain atmospheric nitrogen inputs between these two sites could be explained by differences in net nitrogen immobilization in first year decomposing oak leaves: in the nitrogen-limited oak forest a major part (55%) of the nitrogen input by throughfall was immobilized in the first year oak leaf litter. The three coniferous forests consisted of two monocultures of Douglas fir and a mixed stand of Douglas fir and Scots pine. Despite comparable litter quality in the Douglas fir needles in all sites, completely different nitrogen dynamics were found.
40343534|Banana plantlets (Musa acuminata cv Grande Naine) cultivated in hydroponics take up silicon proportionally to the concentration of Si in the nutrient solution (01.66 mM Si). Here we study the Si status of banana plantlets grown under controlled greenhouse conditions on five soils developed from andesitic volcanic ash, but differing in weathering stage. The mineralogical composition of soils was inferred from X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis and selective chemical/mineralogical extractions. With increasing weathering, the content of weatherable primary minerals decreased. Conversely, clay content increased and stable secondary minerals were increasingly dominant: gibbsite, Fe oxides, allophane, halloysite and kaolinite. The contents of biogenic Si in plant and soil were governed by the reserve of weatherable primary minerals. The largest concentrations of biogenic Si in plant (6.97 g kg) and soil (5058 g kg) occurred in the least weathered soils, where total Si content was above 225 g kg. The lowest contents of biogenic Si in plant (2.84.3 g kg) and soil (831 g kg) occurred in the most weathered desilicated soils enriched with secondary oxides and clay minerals. Our data imply that soil weathering stage directly impacted the soil-to-plant transfer of silicon, and thereby the stock of biogenic Si in a soil-plant system involving a Si-accumulating plant. They further imply that soil type can influence the silicon soilplant cycle and its hydrological output.
23359761|We examined the net exchange of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) between a tidal marsh and its adjacent estuary over a 1-year period from August 2007 to July 2008. Our objectives were to estimate the importance of tidal salt marshes as sources and sinks of mercury within the Chesapeake Bay system, and to examine the hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on mercury fate and transport in tidal marshes. Tidal flows and water chemistry were measured at an established tidal flume at the mouth of the principal tidal creek of a 3-ha marsh section at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. Fluxes were estimated by combining continuous tidal flow measurement for the entire study year, with discrete, hourly, flow-weighted measurements of filterable and particulate THg and MeHg, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and suspended particulate matter (SPM) made over 20 tidal cycles during the year. We found that the marsh was a relatively small net tidal source of MeHg, mainly during the warmer growing season. We also confirmed that the marsh was a substantial source of DOC to the adjacent estuary. DOC was a significant predictor of both filterable THg and MeHg fluxes. However, although the marsh was a source of filterable THg, it was overall a net sink for THg because of particulate trapping. The net per-area annual flux of MeHg from tidal marshes is greater than other MeHg pathways within Chesapeake Bay. The annual load of MeHg from tidal marshes into Chesapeake Bay, however, is likely small relative to fluvial fluxes and efflux from bottom sediment. This study suggests that MeHg production within the tidal marsh has greater consequences for biota inhabiting the marsh than for the efflux of MeHg from the marsh.
1469801|Surface waters in the Florida Everglades contain high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) compounds.  <sup>13</sup>C values of DOC samples collected from the northern Everglades indicate that less than about 23% of the DOC was derived from sugarcane (the dominant agricultural crop in the area), and the amount of DOC from sugarcane was greater during the dry period. Most of the DOC (> 50%) in the northern Everglades was in the low molecular weight (< 1000 Dalton) fraction (LMW-DOC). The relative amount of high molecular weight DOC (HMW-DOC) was higher in the wet period than in the dry period. Radiocarbon ages of the DOC ranged from "> modern" to about 2400 years B.P., indicating that DOC was derived from both historic peat deposits and modern vegetation. At each site, the HMW-DOC had older radiocarbon ages than the LMW-DOC, and therefore contained a greater fraction of DOC derived from the historic peat deposits. It appears that at least some of the old DOC compounds from the historic peat deposits were decomposed during their residence in the surface water system in the northern Everglades, and the LMW-DOC was more microbially labile than the HMW-DOC. Our analysis suggests that accelerated decomposition of organic matter in the historic peat deposits (due to land-use change) could be a significant source of DOC and nutrients in the northern Everglades. Our data also suggest that the radiocarbon signature of DOC could be used as a sensitive indicator of the overall effectiveness of a wetland restoration project.
41490441|Temporal and spatial variations in benthic metabolism and anaerobic carbon oxidation pathways were assessed in an anthropogenically impacted (Mtoni) and a pristine (Ras Dege) mangrove forest in Tanzania. The objectives were (1) to evaluate how benthic metabolism is affected by organic carbon availability; (2) to determine the validity of diffusive release of CO as a measure benthic carbon oxidation; and (3) to assess the partitioning of anaerobic carbon pathways and factors controlling the availability of electron acceptors (e.g. oxidized iron). Microbial carbon oxidation measured as diffusive exchange of O and CO (3267 and 28115 mmol m day, respectively) showed no specific temporal patterns. Low intertidal sediments at Mtoni fed by labile algal carbon of anthropogenic origin had higher diffusive CO release than high intertidal sediments that primarily received less reactive mangrove detritus. Diffusive release of CO apparently underestimated total sediment carbon oxidation due to CO loss from deep sediments via emission through biogenic structures (i.e. crab burrows and pneumatophores) and porewater seepage into creeks. We propose that diffusive fluxes in the present mangrove sediments are roughly equivalent to depth-integrated reactions occurring in the upper 12 cm. Anaerobic carbon oxidation was dominated by FeR irrespective of anthropogenic influence in sediments where the oxidizing effects of biogenic structures increased the Fe(III) level. More than 80% of the anaerobic carbon oxidation in Mtoni and Ras Dege sediments was due to FeR when reactive Fe(III) exceeded 30 mol cm. The anthropogenic influence at Mtoni was primarily noted as up to one order of magnitude higher denitrification than at Ras Dege, but this process always accounted for less than 1% of total carbon oxidation. It is noteworthy that organic and nutrient enrichment of anthropogenic origin in Mtoni has no measurable effect on microbial processes, other than carbon oxidation in the low intertidal area and denitrification throughout the forest, and indicates a strong resilience of mangrove environments towards disturbances.
1469917|Sediment deposition is the main mechanism of nutrient delivery to tidal freshwater marshes (TFMs). We quantified sediment nutrient accumulation in TFMs upstream and downstream of a proposed water withdrawal project on the Mattaponi River, Virginia. Our goal was to assess nutrient availability by comparing relative rates of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) accumulated in sediments with the C, N, and P stoichiometries of surface soils and above ground plant tissues. Surface soil nutrient contents (0.60-0.92% N and 0.09-0.13% P) were low but within reported ranges for TFMs in the eastern US. In both marshes, soil nutrient pools and C, N, and P stoichiometries were closely associated with sedimentation patterns. Differences between marshes were more striking than spatial variations within marshes: both C, N, and P accumulation during summer, and annual P accumulation rates (0.16 and 0.04 g P m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) in sediments were significantly higher at the downstream than at the upstream marsh. Nitrogen:P ratios <14 in above ground biomass, surface soils, and sediments suggest that N limits primary production in these marshes, but experimental additions of N and/or P did not significantly increase above ground productivity in either marsh. Lower soil N:P ratios are consistent with higher rates of sediment P accumulation at the downstream site, perhaps due to its greater proximity to the estuarine turbidity maximum.
1469573|The accumulation of total mercury (Hg<sub>T</sub>) and methylmercury (MeHg) was evaluated in sediments of Tivoli South Bay, a freshwater tidal mudflat wetland in the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve system. Hg<sub>T</sub> concentrations in sediment cores were measured to evaluate the spatial variability of Hg<sub>T</sub> deposition, and to establish a chronology of Hg<sub>T</sub> accumulation. Cores taken from the northern, middle, and southern sections of the bay had similar distribution patterns and concentrations of Hg<sub>T</sub>, suggesting a common source of Hg<sub>T</sub> throughout the bay. Sediment concentrations ranged from 190 to 1040 ng Hg g<sup>-1</sup>, 2 to 10 times greater than concentrations expected in sediments from non-anthropogenic sources. Hg<sub>T</sub> deposition rates were similar in different regions of the bay, and increased from 200 ng Hg cm<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 1930s to a maximum of 300 ng Hg cm<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 1960s. Deposition rates have steadily declined since the 1970s and are currently at 80 ng Hg cm<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Transport of Hg<sub>T</sub> by tidal waters from the Hudson River is likely the main source of Hg<sub>T</sub> in the bay. Distribution patterns and absolute concentrations of MeHg in sediment cores were similar throughout the bay, with concentrations ranging from 0.43 to 2.95 ng g<sup>-1</sup>. Maxima in MeHg concentration profiles occurred just below the sediment-water interface and at a depth of 30 cm. The maximum at 30 cm was coincident with maximum Hg<sub>T</sub> concentrations. MeHg concentrations in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the Hudson River suggest that MeHg in the bay could be derived from riverine SPM rather than formed in situ.
1469945| The chemical compositions of ground water and organic matter in sediments were investigated at a sandy shore of Tokyo Bay, Japan to determine the fate of ground water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. On the basis of Cl<sup>-</sup> distribution in ground water, the beach was classified into freshwater (FR)-, transition (TR)-, and seawater (SW)-zones from the land toward the shoreline. The NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and N<sub>2</sub>O did not behave conservatively with respect to Cl<sup>-</sup> during subsurface mixing of freshwater and seawater, suggesting NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> consumption and N<sub>2</sub>O production in the TR-zone. Absence of beach vegetation indicated that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> assimilation by higher plants was not as important as NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> sink. Low NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations in ground water revealed little reduction of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. These facts implied that microbial denitrification and assimilation were the likely sinks for ground water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. The potential activity and number of denitrifiers in water-saturated sediment were highest in the low-chlorinity part of the TR-zone. The location of the highest potential denitrification activity (DN-zone) overlapped with that of the highest NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration. The C/N ratio and carbon isotope ratio ( <sup>13</sup>C) of organic matter in sediment (< 100 -m) varied from 12.0 to 22.5 and from -22.5 to -25.5, respectively. The  <sup>13</sup>C value was inversely related to the C/N ratio r<sup>2</sup> = 0.968, n = 11), which was explained by the mixing of organic matters of terrestrial and marine origins. In the DN-zone, the fine sediments were rich in organic matters with high C/N ratios and low  <sup>13</sup>C values, implying that dissolved organic matters of terrestrial origin might have been immobilized under slightly saline conditions. A concurrent supply of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and organic matter to the TR-zone by ground water discharge probably generates favorable conditions for denitrifiers. Ground water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> discharged to the beach is thus partially denitrified and fixed as microbial biomass before it enters the sea. Further studies are necessary to determine the relative contribution of these processes for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> removal. 
20519777|Monthly (or bi-weekly) water samples were collected from the Yukon River, one of the largest rivers in North America, at a station near the US Geological Survey Stevens Village hydrological station, Alaska from May to September 2002, to examine the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its seasonal variations. DOM was further size fractionated into high molecular weight (HMW or colloidal, 1 kDa-0.45 m) and low molecular weight (LMW, &lt; 1 kDa) fractions. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), colored dissolved organic matter (C-DOM) and total dissolved carbohydrate (TCHO) species were measured in the size fractionated DOM samples. Concentrations of DOC were as high as 2830 mol-C l during the spring breakup in May and decreased significantly to 508-558 mol-C l during open-water season (June-September). Within the DOC pool, up to 85% was in the colloidal fraction (1 kDa-0.45 m) in early May. As DOC concentration decreased, this colloidal portion remained high (70-85% of the bulk DOC) throughout the sampling season. Concentrations of TCHO, including monosaccharides (MCHO) and polysaccharides (PCHO), varied from 722 mol-C l in May to 129 mol-C l in September, which comprised a fairly constant portion of bulk DOC (24  2%). Within the TCHO pool, the MCHO/TCHO ratio consistently increased from May to September. The C-DOM/DOM ratio and the size fractionated DOM increased from May to September, indicating that DOM draining into the Yukon River contained increased amounts of humified materials, likely related to a greater soil leaching efficiency in summer. The average composition of DOM was 76% pedogenic humic matter and 24% aquagenic CHO. Characteristics of soil-derived humic substances and low chlorophyll-a concentrations support a dominance of terrestrial DOM in Yukon River waters.
1469481|The partial pressures of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2</sub>) and CH<sub>4</sub> (pCH<sub>4</sub>) in streams are not only governed by instream processes, but also by transformations occurring in soil and groundwater ecosystems. As such, stream water pCO<sub>2</sub> and pCH<sub>4</sub> can provide a tool to assess ecosystem respiration and anaerobic metabolism throughout drainage basins. We conducted three surveys sampling the gas content of streams in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina to assess factors regulating ecosystem metabolism in catchments with contrasting geomorphologies, elevations and soil organic matter storage. In our first survey, the influence of drainage basin geomorphology on ecosystem respiration was examined by sampling streams draining catchments underlain by either shale or dolomite. Geomorphology is influenced by geology with shale catchments having shallower soils, broader, unconstrained valley floors compared with dolomite catchments. pCO<sub>2</sub> varied little between catchment types but increased from an average of 3340 ppmv in spring to 9927 ppmv in summer or 9.3 and 28 times atmospheric equilibrium (pCO<sub>2(equilib)</sub>), respectively. In contrast, pCH<sub>4</sub> was over twice as high in streams draining shale catchments (306 ppmv; pCH<sub>4(equilib)</sub>=116) compared with more steeply incised dolomite basins (130 ppmv; pCH<sub>4(equilib)</sub>=51). Using the ratio of pCH<sub>4</sub>: pCO<sub>2</sub> as an index of anaerobic metabolism, shale catchments had nearly twice as much anaerobiosis (pCH<sub>4</sub>: pCO<sub>2</sub>=0.046) than dolomite drainages (pCH<sub>4</sub>: pCO<sub>2</sub>=0.024). In our second survey, streams were sampled along an elevational gradient (525 to 1700 m) in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA where soil organic matter storage increases with elevation. pCO<sub>2</sub> did not vary between streams but increased from 5340 ppmv (pCO<sub>2(equilib)</sub>=15) to 8565 ppmv (pCO<sub>2(equilib)</sub>=24) from spring to summer, respectively. During spring pCH<sub>4</sub> was low and constant across streams, but during summer increased with elevation ranging from 17 to 2068 ppmv (pCH<sub>4(equilib)</sub>=10 to 1216). The contribution of anaerobiosis to total respiration was constant during spring (pCH<sub>4</sub>: pCO<sub>2</sub>=0.017) but during summer increased with elevation from 0.002 at 524 m to 0.289 at 1286 m. In our last survey, we examined how pCO<sub>2</sub> and pCH<sub>4</sub> changed with catchment size along two rivers (ca. 60 km stretches in both rivers corresponding to increases in basin size from 1.7-477 km<sup>2</sup> and 2.5-275 km<sup>2</sup>). pCO<sub>2</sub> and pCH<sub>4</sub> showed opposite trends, with pCO<sub>2</sub> decreasing ca. 50% along the rivers, whereas pCH<sub>4</sub> roughly doubled in concentration downstream. These opposing shifts resulted in a nearly five-fold increase of pCH<sub>4</sub>: pCO<sub>2</sub> along the rivers from a low of 0.012 in headwaters to a high of 0.266 65-km downstream. pCO<sub>2</sub> likely declines moving downstream as groundwater influences on stream chemistry decreases, whereas pCH<sub>4</sub> may increase as the prevalence of anoxia in rivers expands due to finer-grained sediments and reduced hydrologic exchange with oxygenated surface water.
25652606|It is commonly assumed that nitrogen (N) is the primary mineral resource limiting the productivity of temperate forests. Sustained inputs of N via atmospheric deposition are altering the N status of temperate forests raising the possibility that nutrients such as phosphorus (P) are increasingly limiting productivity. The objective of this study was to determine whether P availability limits tree growth alone or in combination with N. This study was conducted in two forest types common throughout the New England landscape of the northeastern United States; in sugar maple and white ash dominated stands growing on base rich parent material characterized by rapid rates of N cycling and high N availability, and in red oakbeechhemlock dominated stands growing on base-poor parent material characterized by slow rates of N cycling and low N availability. Starting in 2004, N and P were added to replicate plots in each forest type in factorial combination at a rate of 150 and 50 kg ha year, respectively. Diameter growth rates of all trees >10 cm DBH were measured in 2005 and 2006 using dendrometer bands and converted into units of basal area increment (BAI) and wood production. Following 2 years of fertilization, basal area increment in the sugar maplewhite ash forests remained strongly N limited. Fertilization with P did not significantly increase BAI alone, although both N and P fertilization tended (P < 0.10) to increase diameter growth in white ash. Wood production in the N-fertilized plots increased by 100 g C m year, roughly doubling production in the non-fertilized plots. In the red oakbeechhemlock stands, there was no overall effect of N or P fertilization on BAI or wood production because BAI in some species was stimulated by fertilization with N alone (e.g., black cherry, red oak), while in other species BAI was unaffected (e.g., red maple, beech) or negatively affected by fertilization with N or P (e.g., eastern hemlock). Given that BAI in several tree species responded to fertilization with N alone and that only one species responded to P fertilization once N was added, this study suggests that decades of atmospheric N deposition have not (yet) resulted in widespread P limitation or saturation of tree demand for N.
41490542|Accurate prediction of future atmospheric CO concentrations is essential for evaluating climate change impacts on ecosystems and human societies. One major source of uncertainty in model predictions is the extent to which global warming will increase atmospheric CO concentrations through enhanced microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon. Recent advances in microbial ecology could help reduce this uncertainty, but current global models do not represent direct microbial control over decomposition. Instead, all of the coupled climate models reviewed in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report assume that decomposition is a first-order decay process, proportional to the size of the soil carbon pool. Here we argue for the development of a new generation of models that link decomposition directly to the size and activity of microbial communities in coupled global models. This process begins with the formulation and validation of fine-scale models that capture fundamental microbial mechanisms without excessive mathematical complexity. These mechanistic models must then be scaled up through an aggregation process and validated at ecosystem to global scales prior to incorporation into global climate models (GCMs). Parameterizing microbial models at the global scale is challenging because some microbial properties such as in situ extracellular enzyme activities are very difficult to measure directly. New parameter fitting procedures may therefore be needed to infer the values of important microbial variables. Validating decomposition models at the global scale is also a challenge, and has not yet been accomplished with the land carbon models embedded in current GCMs. Fortunately new global datasets on soil carbon stocks and fluxes offer promising opportunities to validate both existing land carbon models and new microbial models. If challenges in scaling, parameterization, and validation can be overcome, a new generation of microbially-based decomposition models could substantially improve predictions of carbon-climate feedbacks in the Earth system. Development of new models structures would also reduce any bias due to the assumption of first-order decomposition across all of the models currently referenced in reports of the IPCC.
1469130| Soil microbial biomass content, organic carbon mineralization as well as arginine ammonification rates were estimated in samples from arable and grassland soils and carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emission rates were measured in situ at four sites along a catena. Soil microbial biomass content increased in the order, maize monoculture < crop rotation < dry grassland < wet grassland. The two arable soils had similar rates of carbon mineralization in the laboratory at 22 C (basal respiration) as well as in situ (carbon dioxide emission) at field temperature. Under crop rotation, maize monoculture and dry grassland, the arginine ammonification rate significantly correlated to the microbial biomass content. In contrast, the biomass-specific ammonification rate was low in wet grassland soil, as were in situ N<sub>2</sub>O emission rates. Data from all sites together revealed no general relationship between microbial biomass content and C and N mineralization rates. In addition, there was no general relationship between the quantity of soil microbial biomass and the emission rates of the greenhouse gases CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O. The maize monoculture induced a soil microbial community that was less efficient in using organic carbon compounds, as shown by the high metabolic quotient (respiration rate per unit of biomass). However, microbial biomass content was proportional to basal respiration rate in soils under crop rotation, dry and wet grassland. Arginine ammonification rate was related to microbial biomass content only in fertilized soils. Applications of high quantities of inorganic nitrogen and farmyard manure apparently increase in situ N<sub>2</sub>O emission rates, particularly under crop rotation. The microbial biomass in the unfertilized wet grassland soil seems to be a sink for nitrogen. 
1469969|Concentrations of methyl mercury, CH<sub>3</sub>Hg (II), total mercury, Hg<sub>tot</sub>=CH<sub>3</sub>Hg (II)+Hg (II), and organic sulphur species were determined in soils, soil solutions and streams of a small (50 ha) boreal forest catchment in northern Sweden. The CH<sub>3</sub>Hg (II)/Hg<sub>tot</sub> ratio decreased from 1.2-17.2% in the peaty stream bank soils to 0.4-0.8% in mineral and peat soils 20 m away from the streams, indicating that conditions for net methylation of Hg (II) are most favourable in the riparian zone close to streams. Concentrations of CH<sub>3</sub>Hg (II) bound in soil and in soil solution were significantly, positively correlated to the concentration of Hg<sub>tot</sub> in soil solution. This, and the fact that the CH<sub>3</sub>Hg (II)/Hg<sub>tot</sub> ratio was higher in soil solution than in soil may indicate that Hg (II) in soil solution is more available for methylation processes than soil bound Hg (II). Reduced organic S functional groups (Org-S<sub>RED</sub>) in soil, soil extract and in samples of organic substances from streams were quantified using S K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Org-S<sub>RED</sub>, likely representing RSH, RSSH, RSR and RSSR functionalities, made up 50 to 78% of total S in all samples examined. Inorganic sulphide [e.g. FeS<sub>2</sub> (s)] was only detected in one soil sample out of 10, and in none of the stream samples. Model calculations showed that under oxic conditions nearly 100% of Hg (II) and CH<sub>3</sub>Hg (II) were complexed by thiol groups (RSH) in the soil, soil solution and in the stream water. Concentrations of free CH<sub>3</sub>Hg<sup>+</sup> and Hg<sup>2+</sup> ions in soil solution and stream were on the order of 10<sup>-18</sup> and 10<sup>-32</sup> M, respectively, at pH 5. For CH<sub>3</sub>Hg (II), inorganic bi-sulphide complexes may contribute to an overall solubility at concentrations of inorganic sulphides higher than 10<sup>-9</sup> M, whereas considerably higher concentrations of inorganic sulphides (lower redox-potential) are required to increase the solubility of Hg (II).
1469659| This study was undertaken to determine the rates and controls of anaerobic respiration reactions coupled to organic matter mineralization as a function of space and time along a transect from a bioturbated creekbank to the midmarsh in Georgia saltmarsh sediments. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) were measured at 3 sites during 5 sampling periods throughout the growth season. The sites differed according to hydrologic regime and the abundance of dominant plants and macrofauna. SRR and pore water / solid phase geochemistry showed evidence of enhanced sediment oxidation at sites exposed to intense bioturbation. Iron(III) reduction rates (FeRR) were directly determined in saltmarsh sediments for the first time, and in agreement with measured SRR, higher rates were observed at the bioturbated, unvegetated creekbank (BUC) and bioturbated, vegetated levee (BVL) sites in comparison to a vegetated mid-marsh (MM) site. An unexpected result was the fact that SRR varied nearly as much between sites (2-3 x) as it did with temperature or season (3-4 x). The BVL site, vegetated by the tall form of Spartina alterniflora, always exhibited the highest SRR and carbon oxidation rates (> 4000 nmol cm<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) with high activity levels extending deep ( 50 cm) into the sediment, while the MM site, dominated by the short form of Spartina, always exhibited the lowest SRR which were localized to the top 15 cm of sediment. SRR and FeRR at BUC were intermediate between those measured at the BVL and MM. Acetate was the most abundant microbial fermentation product (concentrations up to > 1 mM) in marsh porewaters, and its distribution reflected respiration activity. Chemical exchange, caused by bioturbation, appeared to be the primary control explaining trends in rates of sulfate and Fe(III) reduction with macrophytes and carbon source acting as secondary controls. 
40343580|We estimated net anthropogenic phosphorus inputs (NAPI) in the Chesapeake Bay region. NAPI is an index of phosphorus pollution potential. NAPI was estimated by quantifying all phosphorus inputs and outputs for each county. Inputs include fertilizer applications and non-food phosphorus uses, while trade of food and feed can be an input or an output. The average of 1987, 1992, 1997, and 2002 NAPI for individual counties ranged from 0.02 to 78.46 kg P ha year. The overall area-weighted average NAPI for 266 counties in the region was 4.52 kg P ha year, indicating a positive net phosphorus input that can accumulate in the landscape or can pollute the water. Large positive NAPI values were associated with agricultural and developed land cover. County area-weighted NAPI increased from 4.43 to 4.94 kg P ha year between 1987 and 1997 but decreased slightly to 4.86 kg P ha year by 2002. Human population density, livestock unit density, and percent row crop land combined to explain 83% of the variability in NAPI among counties. Around 10% of total NAPI entering the Chesapeake Bay watershed is discharged into Chesapeake Bay. The developed land component of NAPI had a strong direct correlation with measured phosphorus discharges from major rivers draining to the Bay (R = 0.81), however, the correlation with the simple percentage of developed land was equally strong. Our results help identify the sources of P in the landscape and evaluate the utility of NAPI as a predictor of water quality.
41410587|Increasing leaching losses of carbon from soils due to accelerated weathering and increasing concentrations of dissolved carbon as a result of intensified soil respiration are suspected to provide a negative feedback on rising atmospheric CO concentrations. We tested this hypothesis by studying concentrations of dissolved carbon and groundwater recharge at the Braunschweig free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment under winter wheat and winter barley. Dissolved carbon concentrations under elevated atmospheric CO and ambient conditions were rather similar and not consistently higher under FACE. An analysis of C signatures suggested that dissolved organic and inorganic carbon contained 9-29% (DOC) and 26-49% (DIC) of "new" carbon originating from CO added to the FACE rings. Dissolved inorganic carbon additionally contained 15-42% of carbonate-derived C. A 15% reduction in evapotranspiration under elevated CO increased groundwater recharge by 60 mm or 55%, which was the main driver for an observed 81% increase in dissolved carbon leaching from 2.7 to 4.9 g C m year at 90 cm depth. Our results suggest that future changes of dissolved carbon leaching losses will be mainly governed by changes in climate and groundwater recharge and to a lesser extent by increasing dissolved carbon concentrations.
20456434|The sequestration and recycling of biogenic silica (BSi) in freshwater tidal marshes was modelled through the combination of short-term year round sediment trap data with a long-term sedimentation model, MARSED. The modelling was implemented through the complete evolution from a young rapidly rising marsh to a marsh with an elevation close to mean high water. BSi in imported suspended matter was higher in summer (10.9 mg BSi g sediment) than winter (7.6 mg BSi g sediment). However, the deposition of BSi on the marsh surface was higher in winter compared to summer, due to the higher sedimentation rates. Deposition of BSi was correlated to the suspended matter deposition. In the old marsh, yearly about 40 g BSi m was deposited, while in the young marsh deposition could rise up to 300 g m. Young marshes retained up to 85% of the imported biogenic silica. Recycling efficiency (60%) increased drastically for older marshes. The study shows that marshes act as important sinks for BSi along estuaries. The recycling of the imported BSi to DSi in summer and spring is most likely an essential factor in the buffering role of tidal marshes for estuarine DSi concentrations.
40343522|The maintenance of nitrogen limitation in terrestrial ecosystems remains a central paradox in biogeochemistry. Although plants that form a symbiotic association with nitrogen fixing bacteria should be at a competitive advantage over non-fixing plant species in N limited environments, N fixing plants are uncommon in most mid-to high-latitude ecosystems. Theory and observation suggest that preferential grazing on N-rich tissues by herbivores, resource limitations to growth, reproduction and N fixation, and temperature limitations to the activity of the N fixing enzyme nitrogenase, explain the rarity of N fixing plants. These ideas, however, have never been confronted by multifactor experiments in the field. In a 3 year field experiment, we found that the abundance, growth, reproductive output and fraction of plant-N derived from N fixation in temperate, old-field ecosystems was constrained by the availability of phosphorus (P). Although the availability of light was crucial to the performance of old-field N fixing plants, the largest gains in biomass and the rate of N fixation were observed in the plots fertilized with P. By contrast, herbivory had no effect on the abundance, biomass and activity of N fixing plants and inconsistent effects on foliar nitrogen concentrations (opposing directions, depending upon year), suggesting that herbivores do not affect the ecology of N fixing plants in old field ecosystems, at least not over the course of 3 years. Together with a recent study demonstrating that C limitation explains the absence of N fixing trees in temperate forests our analysis suggests that stand replacing disturbances shift the limitation on the abundance and activity of N 2 fixing plants from P early in secondary succession to light later in succession, as the forest canopy closes and incident light levels decline precipitously.
1468667| The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) cycle in a softwater lake was studied using natural variations of the stable isotopes of carbon, <sup>12</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C. During summer stratification there was a progressive decrease in epilimnion DIC concentration with a concomitant increase in  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> due to preferential uptake of <sup>12</sup>C by phytoplankton and a change in the dominant CO<sub>2</sub> source from inflow and in situ oxidation to invasion from the atmosphere. There was an increase in hypolimnion DIC concentration throughout summer with a concomitant general decrease in  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>DIC</sub> from oxidation of the isotopically light particulate organic carbon that sank down through the thermocline from the epilimnion. Mass balance calculations of DI<sup>12</sup>C and DI<sup>13</sup>C in the epilimnion for the summer (June 23-September 25) yield a mean rate of net conversion of DIC to organic carbon (C<sub>org</sub>) of 430 150 moles d<sup>-1</sup> (6.5 1.8 mmoles m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Net CO<sub>2</sub> invasion from the atmosphere was 420 120 moles d<sup>-1</sup> (6.2 1.8 m moles m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) with an exchange coefficient of 0.6 0.3 m d<sup>-1</sup>. These results imply that at least for the summer months the phytoplankton obtained about 90% of their carbon from atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub>. About 50% of CO<sub>2</sub> invasion and conversion to C<sub>org</sub> for the summer occurred during a two week interval in mid-summer. DIC concentration increased in the hypolimnion at a rate of 350 70 moles DIC d<sup>-1</sup> during summer stratification. The amount of DIC added to the hypolimnion was equivalent to 75  20% of net conversion of DIC to C<sub>org</sub> in the euphotic zone over spring and summer implying rapid degradation of POC in the hypolimnion. The  <sup>13</sup>C of DIC added to the deep water (- 22) was too heavy to have been derived from oxidation of particulate organic carbon alone. About 20% of the added DIC must have diffused from hypolimnetic sediments where relatively heavy CO<sub>2</sub> (- 7) was produced by a combination of POC oxidation and as a by-product of methanogenesis.

20055192|The spatial upscaling of soil respiration from field measurements to ecosystem levels will be biased without studying its spatial variation. We took advantage of the unique spatial gradients of an oak--grass savanna ecosystem in California, with widely spaced oak trees overlying a grass layer, to study the spatial variation in soil respiration and to use these natural gradients to partition soil respiration according to its autotrophic and heterotrophic components. We measured soil respiration along a 42.5 m transect between two oak trees in 2001 and 2002, and found that soil respiration under tree canopies decreased with distance from its base. In the open area, tree roots have no influence on soil respiration. Seasonally, soil respiration increased in spring until late April, and decreased in summer following the decrease in soil moisture content, despite the further increase in soil temperature. Soil respiration significantly increased following the rain events in autumn. During the grass growing season between November and mid-May, the average of CO efflux under trees was 2.29 mol
41410557|Climate and environmental changes are having profound impacts on Arctic river basins, but the biogeochemical response remains poorly understood. To examine the effect of ice formation on temporal variations in composition and fluxes of carbon and nutrient species, monthly water and particulate samples collected from the lower Yukon River between July 2004 and September 2005 were measured for concentrations of organic and inorganic C, N, and P, dissolved silicate (Si(OH)), and stable isotope composition (D and O). All organic carbon and nutrient species had the highest concentration during spring freshet and the lowest during the winter season under the ice, indicating dominant sources from snowmelt and flushing of soils in the drainage basin. In contrast, inorganic species such as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and Si(OH) had the highest concentrations in winter and the lowest during spring freshet, suggesting dilution during snowmelt and sources from groundwater and leaching/weathering of mineral layer. The contrasting relation with discharge between organic, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and inorganic, such as DIC and Si(OH), indicates hydrological control of solute concentration but different sources and transport mechanisms for organic and inorganic carbon and nutrient species. Concentration of DOC also shows an inter-annual variability with higher DOC in 2005 (higher stream flow) than 2004 (lower stream flow). Average inorganic N/P molar ratio was 110  124, with up to 442 under the ice and 38-70 during the ice-open season. While dissolved organic matter had a higher C/N ratio under the ice (45-62), the particulate C/N ratio was lower during winter (21-26) and spring freshet (19). Apparent fractionation factors of C, N, P, Si and D and O between ice and river water varied considerably, with high values for inorganic species such as DIC and Si(OH) (45 and 9550, respectively) but lower values for DOC (4.7). River ice formation may result in fractionation of inorganic and organic solutes and the repartitioning of seasonal flux of carbon and nutrient species. Annual export flux from the Yukon River basin was 1.6 x 10 g-DOC, 4.4 x 10 g-DIC, and 0.89 x 10 g-POC during 2004-2005. Flux estimation without spring freshet sampling results in considerable underestimation for organic species but significant overestimation for inorganic species regardless of the flux estimation methods used. Without time-series sampling that includes frozen season, an over-or under-estimation in carbon and nutrient fluxes will occur depending on chemical species. Large differences in carbon export fluxes between studies and sampling years indicate that intensive sampling together with long-term observations are needed to determine the response of the Yukon River to a changing climate. sources from snowmelt and flushing of soils in the drainage basin.

20055277|In this study, we examined N gas loss as nitric oxide (NO) from N-fixing biologically crusted soils in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. We hypothesized that NO gas loss would increase with increasing N fixation potential of the biologically crusted soil. NO fluxes were measured from biologically crusted soils with three levels of N fixation potential (Scytonema-Nostoc-Collema spp. (dark) &gt Scytonema-Nostoc-Microcoleus spp. (medium) &gt Microcoleus spp. (light)) from soil cores and field chambers. In both cores and field chambers there was a significant effect of crust type on NO fluxes, but this was highly dependent on season. NO fluxes from field chambers increased with increasing N fixation potential of the biologically crusted soils (dark &gt medium &gt light) in the summer months, with no differences in the spring and autumn. Soil chlorophyll a content (an index of N fixation potential), percent N, and temperature explained 40% of the variability in NO fluxes from our field sites. Estimates of annual NO loss from dark and light crusts was 0.04-0.16 and 0.02-0.11 kg NO-N/ha/year. Overall, NO gas loss accounts for approximately 3-7% of the N inputs via N fixation in dark and light biologically crusted soils. Land use practices have drastically altered biological soil crusts communities over the past century. Livestock grazing and intensive recreational use of public lands has resulted in a large scale conversion of dark cyanolichen crusts to light cyanobacterial crusts. As a result, changes in biologically crusted soils in arid and semi-arid regions of the western US may subsequently impact regional NO loss.
1469394|Anthropogenic perturbations to the global nitrogen (N) cycle now exceed those to any other major biogeochemical cycle on Earth, yet our ability to predict how ecosystems will respond to the rapidly changing N cycle is still poor. While northern temperate forest ecosystems have seen the greatest changes in N inputs from the atmosphere, other biomes, notably semi-arid and tropical regions of the globe, are now experiencing increases in N deposition. These systems are even less well understood than temperate forests, and are likely to respond to excess N in markedly different ways. Here, we present a new integrated terrestrial biophysics-biogeochemical process model, TerraFlux, and use this model to test the relative importance of factors that may strongly influence the productivity response of both humid tropical and semi-arid systems to anthropogenic N deposition. These include hydrological losses of dissolved inorganic and organic N, as well as multiple nutrient interactions with deposited inorganic N along the hydrological pathway. Our results suggest that N-rich tropical forests may have reduced productivity following excess N deposition. Our simulations of semi-arid systems show increases in productivity following N inputs if water availability is sufficient and water losses are moderate. The most important model controls over the carbon cycle response in each simulation were interactions that are not represented in the most common terrestrial ecosystem models. These include parameters that control soil solute transport and nutrient resorption by plants. Rather than attempt prognostic simulations, we use TerraFlux to highlight a variety of ecological and biogeochemical processes that are poorly understood but which appear central to understanding ecosystem response to excess N.
1469302|We employed grass and forest versions of the CENTURY model under a range of N deposition values (0.02-1.60 g N m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>) to explore the possibility that high observed lake and stream N was due to terrestrial N saturation of alpine tundra and subalpine forest in Loch Vale Watershed, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Model results suggest that N is limiting to subalpine forest productivity, but that excess leachate from alpine tundra is sufficient to account for the current observed stream N. Tundra leachate, combined with N leached from exposed rock surfaces, produce high N loads in aquatic ecosystems above treeline in the Colorado Front Range. A combination of terrestrial leaching, large N inputs from snowmelt, high watershed gradients, rapid hydrologic flushing and lake turnover times, and possibly other nutrient limitations of aquatic organisms constrain high elevation lakes and streams from assimilating even small increases in atmospheric N. CENTURY model simulations further suggest that, while increased N deposition will worsen the situation, nitrogen saturation is an ongoing phenomenon.
23359765|A <sup>15</sup>N-tracer method was used to quantify nitrogen (N) removal processes in two relict oxbow wetlands located adjacent to the Minebank Run restored stream reach in Baltimore County (Maryland, USA) during summer 2009 and early spring 2010. A mass-balance approach was used to directly determine the flow of <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub>- to plants, algae, and sediments, with unaccounted for <sup>15</sup>N assumed to be denitrified. During the summer, plant and algal uptake accounted for 42%, of the added <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in oxbow 1, less than 1% remained in the water column and 57% was unaccounted for. In oxbow 2 during the summer, plant and algal uptake accounted for 63% of the added <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> with <1% remaining in the water column and 38% unaccounted for. During the early spring, plant and algal uptake were much lower in both oxbows, ranging from 0.05 to 13.3% of the <sup>15</sup>N added, with 97 and 87% was unaccounted for in oxbow 1 and 2, respectively. The amount of unaccounted for <sup>15</sup>N was equivalent to estimated areal denitrification rates of 12 and 6 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in the summer and 78 and 15 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in the spring, in oxbow 1 and oxbow 2, respectively. However, the uncertainty of these estimates is high as it was difficult to detect accumulation of <sup>15</sup>N in the sediments which could have accounted for a very large percentage of the added <sup>15</sup>N. Our results suggest that the two relict oxbow wetlands are sinks for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> during both summer and spring but that the pathways of removal vary with plants and algae playing a major role in summer but not in spring.
1468501| Pore water composition, pyrite distribution and pyrite crystal morphology of sediments from salt marshes in the Eastern Scheldt, southwestern Netherlands, were examined from July 1984 to October 1986. Hydrology and marsh vegetation were the chief determinants of pyrite accumulation. In the bare sediments of pans in the low marsh, highly reducing conditions prevailed just below the surface. At these sites, practically all the incoming detrital pyrite (0.5-1% FeS<sub>2</sub>) was preserved. The in-situ formation of pyrites was negligible in these anoxic sediments. All incoming detrital pyrite was oxidized in the surface layers (0-10 cm) of the medium-high marsh overgrown with Spartina anglica. Pyrite was formed at a rate of 2.6-3.8 mol S-FeS<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in a narrow range of depths (15-20 cm), at the interface of the oxidizing and underlying reducing sediment. At this interface the concentration profiles of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and dissolved S intersected. The role of the rhizosphere is discussed in connection with pyrite formation. No further pyrite formation occurred deeper in the sediment. This resulted in the build up of high concentrations of dissolved S and acid volatile sulfides (AVS). The decrease with depth in oxalate-extractable Fe indicated that most of the iron oxyhydroxides (70-80%) had been transformed to pyrite. Another 10-20% of oxalate-extractable Fe was present as AVS. The abundance of framboidal pyrite particles and the high concentrations of AVS and dissolved S indicated that the formation of pyrite occurred via iron monosulfide intermediates. There was a linear relationship between the organic carbon and the S-FeS<sub>2</sub> content in the Spartina overgrown reducing sediment. The mean C/S ratio was 4.2. 
40800590|Human activities have profoundly altered the global nitrogen (N) cycle. Increases in anthropogenic N have had multiple effects on the atmosphere, on terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, and even on human health. Unfortunately, methodological limitations challenge our ability to directly measure natural N inputs via biological N fixation (BNF)the largest natural source of new N to ecosystems. This confounds efforts to quantify the extent of anthropogenic perturbation to the N cycle. To address this gap, we used a pair of indirect methodsanalytical modeling and N balanceto generate independent estimates of BNF in a presumed hotspot of N fixation, a tropical rain forest site in central Rondnia in the Brazilian Amazon Basin. Our objectives were to attempt to constrain symbiotic N fixation rates in this site using indirect methods, and to assess strengths and weaknesses of this approach by looking for areas of convergence and disagreement between the estimates. This approach yielded two remarkably similar estimates of N fixation. However, when compared to a previously published bottom-up estimate, our analysis indicated much lower N inputs via symbiotic BNF in the Rondnia site than has been suggested for the tropics as a whole. This discrepancy may reflect errors associated with extrapolating bottom-up fluxes from plot-scale measures, those resulting from the indirect analyses, and/or the relatively low abundance of legumes at the Rondnia site. While indirect methods have some limitations, we suggest that until the technological challenges of directly measuring  fixation are overcome, integrated approaches that employ a combination of model-generated and empirically-derived data offer a promising way of constraining N inputs via BNF in natural ecosystems.
20055268|Leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the O layer is important for the carbon cycling of forest soils. Here we study the role of the Oi, Oe and Oa horizons in DOC leaching from the forest floor in field manipulations carried out in a Norway spruce forest stand in southern Sweden. The manipulations involved the addition and removal of litter and the removal of Oi, Oe and Oa horizons. Our data suggest that both recent litter and humified organic matter contribute significantly to the leaching of dissolved organic matter from the O layer. An addition of litter corresponding to four times annual litterfall resulted in a 35% increase in DOC concentrations and fluxes although the specific UV absorbance remained unchanged. The removal of litterfall and the Oi horizon resulted in a decreased DOC concentration and in a significant increase in the molar UV absorptivity. The DOC concentration under the Oa horizon was not significantly different from that under the Oe horizon and there were no increase in DOC flux, but rather a decrease, from the bottom of the Oe horizon to the bottom of the Oa horizon, suggesting that there is no net release of DOC in the Oa horizon. However, significant leaching of DOC occurred from the Oa horizon when litterfall and the Oi and Oe horizons were removed. This indicates that there is both a removal of DOC from the Oi and Oe horizons and a substantial production of DOC in the Oa horizon. Quantitatively, we suggest that the Oi, Oe and Oa horizons contributed approximately 20, 30 and 50%, respectively, to the overall leaching of DOC from the O layer.
1469748|In this paper isotope ratio mass spectrometry is used to determine the methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) oxidation fraction in the rhizosphere of intact rice plant-soil systems. Earlier studies on quantification of the methane oxidation were based on inhibition or incubation procedures which strongly interfered with the plant-soil system and resulted in a large variability of the reported fractions, while other studies considered stable isotopes at natural abundance levels to investigate methanotrophy in the rhizosphere of rice. The current work is the first that used <sup>13</sup>C-labelled CH<sub>4</sub> as additive and calculated the oxidation fraction from the ratio between the added <sup>13</sup>C-labelled CH<sub>4</sub> and its oxidation product <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>. Both labelled gases could be distinguished from the natural abundance percentages. The oxidation fraction for methane was found to be smaller than 7%, suggesting that former approaches overestimate the methane oxidation fraction.
1469519| Temperate forests of North America are thought to be significant sinks of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. We developed a below-ground carbon (C) budget for well-drained soils in Harvard Forest Massachusetts, an ecosystem that is storing C. Measurements of carbon and radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C) inventory were used to determine the turnover time and maximum rate of CO<sub>2</sub> production from heterotrophic respiration of three fractions of soil organic matter (SOM): recognizable litter fragments (L), humified low density material (H), and high density or mineral-associated organic matter (M). Turnover times in all fractions increased with soil depth and were 2-5 years for recognizable leaf litter, 5-10 years for root litter, 40-100+ years for low density humified material and > 100 years for carbon associated with minerals. These turnover times represent the time carbon resides in the plant + soil system, and may underestimate actual decomposition rates if carbon resides for several years in living root, plant or woody material. Soil respiration was partitioned into two components using <sup>14</sup>C: recent photosynthate which is metabolized by roots and microorganisms within a year of initial fixation (Recent-C), and C that is respired during microbial decomposition of SOM that resides in the soil for several years or longer (Reservoir-C). For the whole soil, we calculate that decomposition of Reservoir-C contributes approximately 41% of the total annual soil respiration. Of this 41%, recognizable leaf or root detritus accounts for 80% of the flux, and 20% is from the more humified fractions that dominate the soil carbon stocks. Measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> and <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> in the soil atmosphere and in total soil respiration were combined with surface CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and a soil gas diffusion model to determine the flux and isotopic signature of C produced as a function of soil depth. 63% of soil respiration takes place in the top 15 cm of the soil (O + A + Ap horizons). The average residence time of Reservoir-C in the plant + soil system is 81 years and the average age of carbon in total soil respiration (Recent-C + Reservoir-C) is 41 years. The O and A horizons have accumulated 4.4 kgC m<sup>-2</sup> above the plow layer since abandonment by settlers in the late-1800's. C pools contributing the most to soil respiration have short enough turnover times that they are likely in steady state. However, most C is stored as humified organic matter within both the O and A horizons and has turnover times from 40 to 100+ years respectively. These reservoirs continue to accumulate carbon at a combined rate of 10-30 gC m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. This rate of accumulation is only 5-15% of the total ecosystem C sink measured in this stand using eddy covariance methods.

1469376|Inputs of surface waters high in chloride and sulphate increased the availability of nutrients in fen peatlands. This 'internal eutrophication' was demonstrated with test plants ('phytometers') and through water and soil analysis. Three experiments are presented in which the level of chloride and/or sulphate was increased to 3 molc l-1. In experiment 1 chloride levels were increased from 0.5 to 3 molc l-1 as CaCl2 or NaCl. In experiment 2 and 3 similar increased levels for chloride and sulphate (3 molc l-1; as NaCl and Na2SO4) were used. The following results were found: (i) No differences in soil total-N and total-P were found before and after the treatments in any of the three experiments. (ii) Experiment 1 showed a significant increase in Bio-Available P (BAP) in pots planted with Anthoxanthum odoratum as well as in bare pots for the NaCl and CaCl2 treatments. The plants in these treatments had taken up much more P. (iii) Experiment 2 showed an increase in soil BAP after treatment with chloride and sulphate in pots planted with Anthoxanthum odoratum. The chloride treatment had no effect on plant biomass, whereas the sulphate treatment resulted in a reduction in root biomass and root N and P content. The shoots showed an increase in P content in the sulphate and chloride treatments, while N content remained the same. (iv) In experiment 3, treatments with chloride and sulphate led to significantly increased biomass and P uptake of Anthoxanthum odoratum. Again, no effects on N uptake were found. These experiments provide evidence for distinctly increased availability of phosphate in peat soils when these come into contact with water with even moderately increased sulphate or chloride levels. Surface water originating from the Rhine river, which is enriched in chloride and sulphate, is often supplied to fen reserves in The Netherlands, to compensate for water losses due to agricultural drainage in the region. The results of this study show that phosphate availability to the vegetation may rise drastically, with detrimental effects on the species density and the occurrence of rare species in the vegetation. Hence, supply of this water should be avoided.
1469457|The natural preindustrial ANC and pH decline associated with 22 melt events from 11 streams during spring flood of 1997 and 1998 in Northern Sweden have been assessed using the Boreal Dilution Model (BDM). The results show that the spring flood pH decline of 0.5 to 2.5 pH units in the streams was largely caused by natural processes. The most important driving factors influencing pH were TOC increase in combination with ANC dilution. The study also demonstrates that pH in some streams can decline to pH values close to 4.5 as a result of natural processes alone. In general the anthropogenic component of the pH decline was between 0.1 and 0.3 pH units superimposed on the natural pH decline. Furthermore, the anthropogenic contribution to ANC and pH decline generally followed the gradient of anthropogenic S deposition in the region. The sites with the greatest inferred anthropogenic influence are also those for which the assumptions used in the BDM were most sensitive. Nevertheless, the results from this study suggest that the regional impact of anthropogenic acid deposition on the ANC and pH in northern Sweden is currently limited.
40343578|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in streams is important, yet few studies focus on DOC dynamics in Midwestern streams during storms. In this study, stream DOC dynamics during storms in two Midwestern watersheds with contrasting land uses, the change in character of stream DOC during storms, and the usability of DOC as a hydrologic tracer in artificially drained landscapes of the Midwest are investigated. Major cation/DOC concentrations, and DOC specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and fluorescence index (FI) were monitored at 2-4 h intervals during three spring storms. Although DOC is less aromatic in the mixed land use watershed than in the agricultural watershed, land use has little impact on stream DOC concentration during storms. For both watersheds, DOC concentration follows discharge, and SUVA and FI values indicate an increase in stream DOC aromaticity and lignin content during storms. The comparison of DOC/major cation flushing dynamics indicates that DOC is mainly exported via overland flow/macropore flow. In both watersheds, the increase in DOC concentration in the streams during storms corresponds to a shift in the source of DOC from DOC originating from mineral soil layers of the soil profile at baseflow, to DOC originating from surficial soil layers richer in aromatic substances and lignin during storms. Results also suggest that DOC, SUVA and FI could be used as hydrologic tracers in artificially drained landscapes of the Midwest. These results underscore the importance of sampling streams for DOC during high flow periods in order to understand the fate of DOC in streams.
24715362|In the eastern part of Lake Constance, the second largest pre-alpine lake in Europe, about five hundred pockmarks (morphological depressions on the lake floor) were recently discovered of which 40 % release methane bubbles. The carbon isotopic composition of the escaping gas indicated that the methane is of biogenic origin. In our study, we investigated the fate of the released methane bubbles, i.e., the dissolution, oxidation or transport of the bubbles to the surface. At a littoral pockmark site (PM12, 12 m water depth) and a profundal pockmark (PM80, 80 m water depth), we analysed the dissolved methane concentrations and the methane isotopic carbon signature in the water column. At PM80, higher methane concentrations (up to 1,523 nM), compared to the control site and the surface waters (225  72 nM), were recorded only on some occasions and only in the bottom water, despite the fact that the released bubbles were dissolving within the hypolimnion based on bubble modeling. The isotope data suggest that most of the dissolved methane is oxidized below 40 m water depth. The isotopic signature of the methane in the surface water at PM80, however, differed from that of the methane in the hypolimnion; therefore, the surface methane at this profundal site is most likely an export product from the littoral zone. Assuming an initial bubble diameter of 5 mm, we calculated that these small bubbles would reach the surface, but approximately 96 % of the methane would have dissolved from the bubble into the hypolimnion. At PM12, we observed higher concentrations of dissolved methane (312  52 nM) with no significant differences between seasons or between control sites versus pockmark site. In the shallow water, divers estimated the bubble size to be 1015 mm, which from a release depth of 12 m would barely dissolved into the water column. The isotopic signature also indicated that there had been almost no methane oxidation in the shallow water column. Thus, the water depth of bubble release as well as the initial bubble size determine whether the methane enters the atmosphere largely unhindered (shallow site) or if the released methane is incorporated into the profundal water column.
1469545|The influence of hydrology and patterns of supply of electron donors and acceptors on subsurface denitrification was studied in a forest riparian zone along the Boyne River in southern Ontario that received high nitrogen inputs from a sand aquifer. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) subsurface denitrification is restricted to localized zones of high activity; (2) denitrification zones occur at sites where groundwater flow paths transport NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to supplies of available organic carbon. A plume of nitrate-rich groundwater with concentrations of 10-30 mg N L<sup>-1</sup> flowed laterally at depths of 1.5-5 m in sands beneath peat for a horizontal distance of 100-140 m across the riparian zone to within 30-50 m of the river. In situ acetylene injections to piezometers revealed that significant denitrification was restricted to a narrow zone of steep NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and N<sub>2</sub>O decline at the plume margins. The location of these denitrification sites in areas with steep gradients of groundwater DOC increase supported hypothesis 2. Many of these denitrification "hotspots" occurred near interfaces between sands and either peats or buried river channel deposits. Field experiments involving in situ additions of either glucose or NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to piezometers indicated that denitrification was C-limited in a large subsurface area of the riparian zone, and became N-limited beyond the narrow zone of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> consumption. These data suggest that denitrification may not effectively remove NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from groundwater transported at depth through permeable riparian sediments unless interaction occurs with localized supplies of organic matter.
1469435|It has been suggested that a feedback exists between the vegetation and soil whereby fertile (vs infertile) sites support species with shorter leaf life spans and higher quality litter which promotes rapid decomposition and higher soil nutrient availability. The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize and compare the C and N dynamics of dominant upland forest ecosystems in north central Wisconsin, (2) compare the nutrient use efficiency (NUE) of these forests, and (3) examine the relationship between NUE and site characteristics. Analyzing data from 24 stands spanning a moisture / nutrient gradient, we found that resource-poor stands transferred less C and N from the vegetation to the forest floor, and that N remained in the forest floor at least four times longer than in more resource-rich stands. Analyzing data by leaf habit, we found that less N was transferred to the forest floor annually via litterfall in conifer stands, and that N remained in the forest floor of these stands nearly three times longer than in hardwood stands. NUE did not differ among forests with different resource availabilities, but was greater for conifers than for hardwoods. Vitousek's (1982) index of nutrient use efficiency (I<sub>NUE1</sub> = leaf litterfall biomass / leaf litterfall N) was most closely correlated to litterfall specific leaf area and percent hardwood leaf area index, suggesting that differences in species composition may have been responsible for the differences in NUE among our stands. NUE2, defined as ANPP / leaf litterfall N, was not closely correlated to any of the site characteristics included in this analysis.
20055256|Biodeposition is a process that strongly affects physical, chemical and biological properties near the sediment--water interface, and mollusks have been shown to influence the cycling of many biogenic elements. In the Bay of Brest ecosystem, the invasive benthic suspension feeder Crepidula fornicata has been proliferating for 50 years, and its influence on phytoplankton dynamics at a seasonal scale, via its role on a coastal silicate pump, has been suggested by Chauvaud et al. (2000) [Chauvaud L., Jean F., Ragueneau O. and Thouzeau G. 2000. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 200: 35-48] and tested by Ragueneau et al. (2002a) [Ragueneau O., Chauvaud L., Leynaert A., Thouzeau G., Paulet Y.-M., Bonnet S., Lorrain A., Grall J., Corvaisier R., Le Hir M., Jean F. and Clavier J. (2002a). Limnol. Oceanogr. 47(6): 1849-1854]. In the present manuscript, we explore further, at an annual scale, the role of biodeposition in the Si cycle of the Bay of Brest. We show that annual biodeposition Si can represent up to 84% of river silicic acid inputs. We also show that preservation of biogenic silica in C. fornicata mats is very good (27%), leading to an annual retention of Si of 23% of river inputs. We suggest that this high retention is essentially controlled by the biodeposition mechanism, which is directly under the control of the proliferation of the exotic suspension feeder. We conclude that this mechanism might be very important in controlling the Si retention along the land--ocean continuum and should be tested in the many areas of the coastal ocean submitted to the proliferation of such exotic species that modify sedimentation of biogenic matter.
41490488|Concentrations of cations (Na , Ca , Mg , K, NH), anions (HCO, Cl, NO, SO, PO) and suspended sediments in the Madeira River water were determined near the city of Porto Velho (RO), in order to assess variation in water chemistry from 2004 to 2007. Calcium and bicarbonate were the dominant cation and anion, respectively. Significant seasonal differences were found, with highest concentrations occurring during the dry season, as expected from the drainage of Andean carbonate-rich substratum. Interannual variations were also observed, but became significant only when annual average discharge was 25% less than normal. Under this atypical discharge condition, bicarbonate was replaced by sulfate, and higher suspended sediment concentrations and loads were also observed. Compared to previously published studies, it appears that no significant changes in water chemistry have occurred during the last 20-30 years, although differences in approaches and sampling designs among this and previous studies may not allow detection of modest changes. The calculated suspended sediment load reported here is close to the values presented elsewhere, reinforcing the relative importance of this river as a sediment supplier for the Amazon Basin. Seasonality has a significant control on the chemistry of Madeira River waters, and severe decrease in discharge due to anthropogenic changes, such as construction of reservoirs or the occurrence of drier yearsa plausible consequence of global climate changemay lead to modification in the chemical composition as well in the sediment deliver to the Amazon River.
1469450|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) represent an important part of the C and N cycles in forest ecosystems. Little is known about the controls on fluxes and concentrations of these compounds in soils under field conditions. Here we compiled published data on concentrations and fluxes of DOC and DON from 42 case studies in forest ecosystems of the temperate zone in order to evaluate controls on a larger temporal and spatial scale. The focus was on annual fluxes and concentrations in throughfall, forest floor leachates and soil solutions. In all compartments considered, concentrations and fluxes differed widely between the sites. Highest concentrations of DOC and DON were generally observed in forest floor leachates and in A horizons. Highest fluxes occurred in forest floor leachates. The fluxes of DOC and DON in forest floor leachates increased with increasing annual precipitation and were also positively related to DOC and DON fluxes with throughfall. Variation in throughfall fluxes could explain 46% and 65% of the variation in DOC and DON fluxes from the forest floor, respectively. No general difference in DOC and DON concentrations and fluxes in forest floor leachates was found when comparing coniferous and hardwood sites. Concentrations of DOC in forest floor leachates were positively correlated to the pH of the forest floor. Furthermore, there was no relationship between organic C and N stocks, soil C/N, litterfall or mineral N inputs and concentrations and fluxes of DOC and DON in forest floor leachates. Including all compartments, fluxes of DOC and DON were highly correlated. Ratios of DOC to DON calculated from fluxes from the forest floor were independent of the amount of annual precipitation, pointing to a similar response of DOC and DON to precipitation conditions. A decrease in the ratio of DOC to DON with soil depth as observed on a plot-scale, was not confirmed by data analysis on a large scale. The controls observed on annual fluxes and concentrations of DON and DOC at regional scale differed from those reported for smaller time and space scales.
1469345|The convergent evolution of polyphenol-rich plant communities has occurred on highly acidic and infertile soils throughout the world. The pygmy forest in coastal northern California is an example of an ecosystem on an extremely infertile soil that has exceptionally high concentrations of polyphenols. Many 'negative feedbacks' have been identified whereby plants degrade fertile soils through production of polyphenol-rich litter, sequestering soil nutrients into unavailable form and creating unfavorable conditions for seed germination, root growth, and nutrient uptake. But in the context of plant-litter-soil interactions in ecosystems adapted to soils that are inherently acidic and infertile (such as the pygmy forest), there are also many 'positive feedbacks' that result from polyphenol production. By inhibiting decomposition, polyphenols regulate the formation of a mor-humus litter layer, conserving nutrients and creating a more favorable medium for root growth. Polyphenols shift the dominant pathway of nitrogen cycling from mineral to organic forms to minimize potential N losses from the ecosystem and maximize litter-N recovery by mycorrhizal symbionts. Polyphenol complexation of Al, Mn and Fe reduce potential Al toxicity and P fixation in soil. Polyphenols regulate organic matter dynamics, leading to the accumulation of organic matter with cation exchange capacity to minimize leaching of nutrient cations. Humic substances derived from polyphenolic precursors coat rhizosphere soil surfaces, improving physical and chemical conditions for root growth and nutrient cycling. Although their long-accepted adaptive value for antiherbivore defense is now in doubt, polyphenol alteration of soil conditions and regulation of nutrient cycling illustrate how fitness can be influenced by the 'extended' phenotype in plant-litter-soil interactions.
23359767|Methane (CH 4 ) is an important greenhouse gas whose emission from the largest source, wetlands is controlled by a number of environmental variables amongst which temperature, water-table, the availability of substrates and the CH 4 transport properties of plants are most prominent and well characterised. Coastal wetland ecosystems are vulnerable to invasion by alien plant species which can make a significant local contribution to altering their species composition. However the effect of these changes in species composition on CH 4 flux is rarely examined and so is poorly understood. Spartina alterniflora, a perennial grass native to North America, has spread rapidly along the south-east coast of China since its introduction in 1979. From 2002, this rapid invasion has extended to the tidal marshes of the Min River estuary, an area that, prior to invasion was dominated by the native plant Cyperus malaccensis. Here, we compare CH 4 flux from the exotic invasive plant S. alterniflora with measurements from the aggressive native species Phragmites australis and the native species C. malaccensis following 3-years of monitoring. CH 4 emissions were measured over entire tidal cycles. Soil CH 4 production potentials were estimated for stands of each of above plants both in situ and in laboratory incubations. Mean annual CH 4 fluxes from S. alterniflora, P. australis and C. malaccensis dominated stands over the 3 years were 95.7 (18.7), 38.9 (3.26) and 10.9 (5.26) g m -2 year -1 , respectively. Our results demonstrate that recent invasion of the exotic species S. alterniflora and the increasing presence of the native plant P. australis has significantly increased CH 4 emission from marshes that were previously dominated by the native species C. malaccensis. We also conclude that higher above ground biomass, higher CH 4 production and more effective plant CH 4 transport of S. alterniflora collectively contribute to its higher CH 4 emission in the Min River estuary.
1468903|Dissolved nutrient inputs in bulk precipitation and outputs in streamwater were measured during 3 years of contrasting hydrological conditions in a 6.3-ha, grazed heathland watershed on schists in the Montseny mountains (NE Spain), drained by an intermittent stream. On average, 39% of the precipitation became streamflow. Bulk precipitation delivered positive net alkalinity (mean 0.22 keq/ha/yr), sulphate input was moderate (9.0 kg SO<sub>4</sub>-S/ha/yr), and the mean input of inorganic N was not exceptionally high (6.6 kg/ha/yr). Ion concentrations were relatively low in streamwater; SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was the dominant anion. Most concentrations in streamwater varied seasonally, with maxima in late summer or early autumn and minima in spring. This pattern probably resulted from increased availability of ions for leaching due to decomposition of organic matter and chemical weathering during the warm period. Nitrate concentrations were relatively high in winter and dropped sharply in early spring, probably because of biological uptake. Annual element outputs in streamwater varied between years and seemed to be controlled by both the amount of annual streamflow and its seasonal distribution. Annual inputs exceeded outputs for dissolved inorganic N. The watershed accumulated H<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, had net losses of Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and was close to steady state for K<sup>+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and alkalinity. The chloride budgets gave no evidence of substantial dry deposition in this system. The cationic denudation rate was negative (-0.14 keq/ha/yr) because Ca<sup>2+</sup> retention was higher than net exports of Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> from silicate weathering. Low nutrient export and little production of alkalinity suggest that this watershed has a low buffering capacity.
1469389| Peroxidases are enzymes that catalyze the oxidative cross-linking and polymerization of certain organic compounds by hydrogen peroxide and other organic peroxides. This study demonstrates that peroxidases are present in dew (droplets formed as the result of guttation) collected from Bermuda grass hybrids 419 and Tifway 2 [Cynodon dactylon (L.)  Cynodon transvaalensis Davy], which are warm-season C<sub>4</sub> grasses, and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), which is a cool-season C<sub>3</sub> grass. Peroxidase activity [quantified with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (activity 152 purpurogallin units/mg) as standard] in guttational fluids collected from grasses during early morning was in the 80 to 120 g/L range. Isoelectric focusing was used to determine isoelectric points (pI) of the isozymes present in the Bermuda grass dew following dialysis and lyophilization of the collected dew. The pI values ranged from 4.3 to 8.3 with 14 isozymes being detected using guaiacol and hydrogen peroxide as substrates. Peroxidases also were extracted from soil supporting the growth of Bermuda grass. Peroxidases in these soils were most abundant in the top 5 cm layer (activity was in the 6.8 to 16 purpurogallin units/g range). Stability and activity of these peroxidases in the presence of fulvic and humic acids were evaluated. Compared to controls with no added humic substances, peroxidase activity was inhibited by a soil fulvic acid and prolonged by a humic acid. Field measurements indicated that peroxidase activity did not greatly decrease during the winter when the grass was dormant, indicating that the peroxidases released into the soil remain active for a considerable time. Based on results in these studies and previously determined dry and wet deposition of atmospheric peroxides, we estimate that peroxidase-catalyzed reactions in areas planted in these grasses may convert about 8 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of labile soil organic compounds to more persistent oligomers and polymers. 
1469910|The occurrence of volatile organometallic species of tin was evidenced and investigated in three major European estuaries, such as the Gironde (F), the Rhine (NL) and the Scheldt (B/NL), along with the salinity gradient and for all seasons. The most ubiquitous species, observed in surface water, were found to be methylated forms of butyl-tin derivatives (Bu<sub>n</sub>SnMe<sub>4-n</sub>, n=0-3), with concentrations significantly higher in the Scheldt (ca. 75-2000 fmol l<sup>-1</sup>) than in the Rhine (ca. 5-125 fmol l<sup>-1</sup>) and the Gironde (ca. 5-90 fmol l<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, estuarine anoxic sediments were found to contain large amount of such volatile tin species. The presence of volatile organic tin compounds is then supposed to result from natural methylation processes of both inorganic metal and anthropogenic derivatives accumulated in the sediments (i.e. tributyltin released from ship antifouling paintings and waste water discharges). These results suggest that microbial mediated and/or chemical methylation mechanisms are likely to produce volatile organotin species in anoxic estuarine environments. The production of volatile organotin species is also mainly dependent on the direct anthropogenic load of butyltin compounds within the estuary and on the residence time of such compounds in the system. Estuarine profiles along with the salinity gradient demonstrate that all investigated estuaries are continuous sources of volatile tin species, although these estuaries present different anthropogenic organotin discharges. In consequence, significant export of volatile tin species to the adjacent coastal waters were found. Finally, the evaluation of the seasonal fluxes of volatile tin species to the atmosphere establishes that volatilisation is a major sink for such compound in estuaries with long water residence time (i.e. Scheldt, Gironde).
20456435|The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is the largest terrestrial reservoir of carbon and plant residues play an important role in its maintenance. Up to 70-80% of SOC in arable soil is composed of humic substances (HS). In these soils post-harvested residues, left in arable soil after harvesting the crops, are the basic source of humus. Previous research indicated that maize plants residue contain a humic acid (HA) fraction possessing recalcitrant compounds that contributed to soil-HA fraction. This study presents updated results obtained using Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) to provide an indication of the contribution of the lignin to the soil HA. Results obtained indicated that the HAs from maize plants were mainly composed of lignin-derived moieties that were likely derived from the partial hydrolysis of p-coumaric and ferulic acid that are linked to lignin, polysaccharides or other biopolymers of the cell wall. Lignin composing the HAs derived from plants and incubated in soil was substantially preserved. Nevertheless the modification of the syringyl/guaiacyl ratio and the oxidation of the side-chains of lignin, suggested a turnover of lignin-derived molecules in soil-HA fraction. This fact indicated an involvement of the alkali insoluble fraction of maize plant residue (humin) in the soil-HA formation, up-dating our previous knowledge.
1469093|Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) in subtidal sediments of Tomales Bay, California, were variable by sediment type, season and depth. Higher rates were measured in near-surface muds during summer (up to 45 nmol cm<sup>-3</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>), with lower rates in sandy sediments, in winter and deeper in the sediment. Calculations of annual, average SRR throughout the upper 20 cm of muddy subtidal sediments (about 30 mmol S m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) were much larger than previously reported net estimates of SRR derived from both benthic alkalinity flux measurements and bay wide, budget stoichiometry (3.5 and 2.6 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively), indicating that most reduced sulfur in these upper, well-mixed sediments is re-oxidized. A portion of the net alkalinity flux across the sediment surface may be derived from sulfate reduction in deeper sediments, estimated from sulfate depletion profiles at 1.5 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. A small net flux of CO<sub>2</sub> measured in benthic chambers despite a large SRR suggests that sediment sinks for CO<sub>2</sub> must also exist (e.g., benthic microalgae).
1469493|Nitrogen (N) dynamics were evaluated from 1 June 1995 through 31 May 1996 within the Arbutus Lake watershed in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, U.S.A. At the Arbutus Lake outlet dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> contributed 61%, 33%, and 6% respectively, to the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) flux (259 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). At the lake inlet DON, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> constituted 36%, 61%, and 3% respectively, of TDN flux (349 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Differences between the factors that control DON, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stream water concentrations were evaluated using two methods for estimating annual N flux at the lake inlet. Using biweekly sampling NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> flux was 10 and 4 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> respectively, less than flux estimates using biweekly plus storm and snowmelt sampling. DON flux was 18 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> greater using only biweekly sampling. These differences are probably not of ecological significance relative to the total flux of N from the watershed (349 mol ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Dissolved organic N concentrations were positively related to discharge during both the dormant (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.31; P < 0.01) and growing season (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.09; P < 0.01). There was no significant relationship between NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration and discharge during the dormant season, but a significant negative relationship was found during the growing season (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.29; P < 0.01). Biotic controls in the growing season appeared to have had a larger impact on stream water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations than on DON concentrations. Arbutus Lake had a major impact on stream water N concentrations of the four landscape positions sampled, suggesting the need to quantify within lake processes to interpret N solute losses and patterns in watershed-lake systems.
1469711|A mechanistic model is presented on the processes leading to methane oxidation in rice rhizosphere. The model is driven by oxygen release from a rice root into anaerobic rice soil. Oxygen is consumed by heterotrophic and methanotrophic respiration, described by double Monod kinetics, and by iron oxidation, described by a second order reaction. Substrates for these reactions -- ferrous iron, acetate and methane -- are produced by an exponential time dependent organic matter mineralisation in combination with modified Michaelis Menten kinetics for competition for acetate and hydrogen. Compounds diffuse between rhizosphere, root and atmosphere. A diffusion resistance between the rice root and shoot is included. Active transport across the root surface occurs for root exudation and plant nutrient uptake. Iron adsorption is described dependent on pH. The model predicts well root oxygen release, compound gradients and compound concentrations in a rice rhizosphere. Methane oxidation estimates are comparable to experimental estimates. A sensitivity analysis showed however that methane oxidation is highly dependent on model initialisation and parameterisation, which is highly dependent on the history of the rhizosphere and root growth dynamics. Equilibrium is not obtained within the period that a single root influences a soil microsite and results in a large change in methane storage. Equilibrium is moreover dependent upon the diffusion resistance across the root surface. These factors make methane oxidation dynamics highly variable in space and time and dependent on root dynamics. The increased understanding of methane oxidation does not directly lead to increased predictive abilities, given this high variability and the uncertainties involved in rhizosphere dynamics.
20055226|Topsoil is very sensitive to human disturbance under the changing climate. Estimates of topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) pool may be crucial for understanding soil C dynamics under human land uses and soil potential of mitigating the increasing atmospheric CO by soil C sequestration. China is a country with long history of cultivation. In this paper, we present an estimate of topsoil SOC pool and cultivation-induced pool reduction of China soils based upon the data of all the soil types identified in the 2nd national soil survey conducted during 1979-1982. The area of cultivated soils of China amounted to 138  10 ha while the uncultivated soils occupied 740  10 ha in 1980. Topsoil SOC density ranged from 0.77 to 1489 t
1469684|N limitation to primary production and other ecosystem processes is widespread. To understand the causes and distribution of N limitation, we must understand the controls of biological N fixation. The physiology of this process is reasonably well characterized, but our understanding of ecological controls is sparse, except in a few cultivated ecosystems. We review information on the ecological controls of N fixation in free-living cyanobacteria, vascular plant symbioses, and heterotrophic bacteria, with a view toward developing improved conceptual and simulation models of ecological controls of biological N fixation. A model (Howarth et al. 1999) of cyanobacterial fixation in lakes (where N fixation generally increases substantially when N:P ratios are low) versus estuaries (where planktonic N fixation is rare regardless of N:P ratios) concludes that an interaction of trace-element limitation and zooplankton grazing could constrain cyanobacteria in estuaries and so sustain N limitation. Similarly, a model of symbiotic N fixation on land (Vitousek & Field 1999) suggests that shade intolerance, P limitation, and grazing on N-rich plant tissues could suppress symbiotic N fixers in late-successional forest ecosystems. This congruence of results raises the question -- why do late-successional tropical forests often contain many potentially N-fixing canopy legumes, while N fixers are absent from most late-successional temperate and boreal forests? We suggest that relatively high N availability in lowland tropical forests permits legumes to maintain an N-demanding lifestyle (McKey 1994) without always being required to pay the costs of fixing N. Overall, both the few simulation models and the more-numerous conceptual models of ecological controls of biological N fixation suggest that there are substantial common features across N-fixing organisms and ecosystems. Despite the many groups of organisms capable of fixing N, and the very different ecosystems in which the process is important, we suggest that these common controls provide a foundation for the development of regional and global models that incorporate ecological controls of biological N fixation.
1469381|Relatively high deposition of nitrogen (N) in the northeastern United States has caused concern because sites could become N saturated. In the past, mass-balance studies have been used to monitor the N status of sites and to investigate the impact of increased N deposition. Typically, these efforts have focused on dissolved inorganic forms of N (DIN = NH<sub>4</sub>-N+NO<sub>3</sub>-N) and have largely ignored dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) due to difficulties in its analysis. Recent advances in the measurement of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) have facilitated measurement of DON as the residual of TDN - DIN. We calculated DON and DIN budgets using data on precipitation and streamwater chemistry collected from 9 forested watersheds at 4 sites in New England. TDN in precipitation was composed primarily of DIN. Net retention of TDN ranged from 62 to 89% (4.7 to 10 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) of annual inputs. DON made up the majority of TDN in stream exports, suggesting that inclusion of DON is critical to assessing N dynamics even in areas with large anthropogenic inputs of DIN. Despite the dominance of DON in streamwater, precipitation inputs of DON were approximately equal to outputs. DON concentrations in streamwater did not appear significantly influenced by seasonal biological controls, but did increase with discharge on some watersheds. Streamwater NO<sub>3</sub>-N was the only fraction of N that exhibited a seasonal pattern, with concentrations increasing during the winter months and peaking during snowmelt runoff. Concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub>-N varied considerably among watersheds and are related to DOC:DON ratios in streamwater. Annual DIN exports were negatively correlated with streamwater DOC:DON ratios, indicating that these ratios might be a useful index of N status of upland forests.
1468632|We have developed a model to simulate the dynamics of C, N, P, and S in cultivated and uncultivated grassland soils. The model uses a monthly time step and can simulate the dynamics of soil organic matter over long time periods (100 to 10,000 years). It was used to simulate the impact of cultivation (100 years) on soil organic matter dynamics, nutrient mineralization, and plant production and to simulate soil formation during a 10,000 year run. The model was validated by comparing the simulated impact of cultivation on soil organic matter C, N, P, and S dynamics with observed data from sites in the northern Great Plains. The model correctly predicted that N and P are the primary limiting nutrients for plant production and simulated the response of the system to inorganic N, P, and S fertilizer. Simulation results indicate that controlling the C:P and C:S ratios of soil organic matter fractions as functions of the labile P and S levels respectively, allows the model to correctly simulate the observed changes in C:P and C:S ratios in the soil and to simulate the impact of varying the labile P and S levels on soil P and S net mineralization rates.
40343747|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) concentrations were quantified in urban and rural watersheds located in central Texas, USA between 2007 and 2008. The proportion of urban land use ranged from 6 to 100% in our 12 study watersheds which included nine watersheds without waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and three watersheds sampled downstream of a WWTP. Annual mean DOC concentrations ranged 20.4-52.5 mg L. Annual mean DON concentrations ranged 0.6-1.9 mg L. Only the rural watersheds without a WWTP had significantly lower DOC concentrations compared to those watersheds with a WWTP but all the streams except two had significantly reduced DON compared to those with a WWTP. Analysis of the nine watersheds without a WWTP indicated that 68% of the variability in mean annual DOC concentration was explained by urban open areas such as golf courses, sports fields and neighborhood parks under turf grass. There was no relationship between annual mean DON concentration and any land use. Urban open area also explained a significant amount of the variance in stream sodium and stream sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Ninetyfour percent of the variance in annual mean DOC concentration was explained by SAR. Irrigation of urban turf grass with domestic tap water high in sodium (> 181 mg Na L) may be inducing sodic soil conditions in watershed soils in this region resulting in elevated mean annual DOC concentrations in our streams.
20055317|The aim of this study is to infer past changes in total organic carbon (TOC) content of lake water during the Holocene in eight boreal forest, tree-limit and alpine lakes using a new technique -- near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

1469822|A vast number of lakes developed in the abandoned opencast lignite mines of Lusatia (East Germany) contain acidic waters (<pH 3) with high concentrations of dissolved iron and sulfate. The elimination of iron and sulfate by microbially mediated reduction processes produces alkalinity, whereas the reoxidation of reduced sulfur compounds consumes alkalinity. In order to determine the influence of environmental factors with the prospect of biological remediation strategies, these processes were investigated in sediments of two acidic and one pH-neutral mining lake. Slightly acidic sediment underlying permanently anoxic waters showed a higher accumulation rate of reduced inorganic sulfur than the pH-neutral sediment (60 v.s. 45 mmol S m<sup>-2</sup> a<sup>-</sup>). Potential Fe(III) reduction measured by the accumulation of Fe(II) during anoxic incubation yielded similar rates in both types of sediments, however, the responses towards the supplementation of Fe(III) and organic carbon were different. Sulfate reduction rates estimated with <sup>35</sup>S-radiotracer were much lower in the slightly acidic sediment than in the pH-neutral sediment (156 v.s. 738 mmol SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> m<sup>-2</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>). However, sulfate reduction rates were increased by the addition of organic carbon. Severe limitation of sulfate-reducing bacteria under acidic conditions was also reflected by low most probable numbers (MPN). High MPN of acidophilic iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in acidic sediments indicated a high reoxidation potential. The results show that potentials for reductive processes are present in acidic sediments and that these are determined mainly by the availability of oxidants and organic matter.

41490544|Soil microbes regulate the transfer of carbon (C) from ecosystems to the atmosphere and in doing so influence feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and global climate change. Fire is one element of global change that may influence soil microbial communities and, in turn, their contribution to the C dynamics of ecosystems. In order to improve our understanding of how fire influences belowground communities, we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 published microbial responses to fire. We hypothesized that microbial biomass as a whole, and fungal biomass specifically, would be altered following fires. Across all studies, fire reduced microbial abundance by an average of 33.2% and fungal abundance by an average of 47.6%. However, microbial responses to fire differed significantly among biomes and fire types. For example, microbial biomass declined following fires in boreal and temperate forests but not following grasslands fires. In addition, wildfires lead to a greater reduction in microbial biomass than prescribed burns. These differences are likely attributable to differences in fire severity among biomes and fire types. Changes in microbial abundance were significantly correlated with changes in soil CO emissions. Altogether, these results suggest that fires may significantly decrease microbial abundance, with corresponding consequences for soil CO emissions.
1469802|Based on microstructure measurements of temperature and horizontal current velocity the physical structure in the water column of Lake Kinneret was characterized as a five layer system consisting of a surface mixed layer, lower epilimnion, metalimnion, upper hypolimnion and benthic boundary layer. Using oxygen and hydrogen sulfide as natural chemical tracers, the time scale of chemical change was identified in relation to advection, mixing and biological processes. Rapid changes due to advection that took place on an hourly time scale were removed by referring the data back to the temperature of the water. Biological activity dominated the hydrochemical changes observed in the meta-and upper hypolimnion. These were expressed by DO depletion rates of 2.0 and 0.4 g m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Vertical and horizontal mixing were shown to occur on a seasonal time scale. Once the chemical stratification process was completed the slow mixing through the benthic boundary layer became the limiting factor for subsequent reactions in the water column.

40343597|The catabolic diversity of wetland microbial communities may be a sensitive indicator of nutrient loading or changes in environmental conditions. The objectives of this study were to assess the response of periphyton and microbial communities in water conservation area-2a (WCA-2a) of the Everglades to additions of C-substrates and inorganic nutrients. Carbon dioxide and CH production rates were measured using 14 days incubation for periphyton, which typifies oligotrophic areas, and detritus, which is prevalent at P-impacted areas of WCA-2a. The wetland was characterized by decreasing P levels from peripheral to interior, oligotrophic areas. Microbial biomass and N mineralization rates were higher for oligotrophic periphyton than detritus. Methane production rates were also higher for unamended periphyton (80 mg CH-Ckg d) than detritus (22 mg CH-C kg d), even though the organic matter content was higher for detritus (80%) than periphyton (69%). Carbon dioxide production for unamended periphyton (222 mg CO-C kg d) was significantly greater than unamended detritus (84 mg CO-C kg d). The response of the heterotrophic microbial community to added C-substrates was related to the nutrient status of the wetland, as substrate-induced respiration (SIR) was higher for detritus than periphyton. Amides and polysaccharides stimulated SIR more than other C-substrates, and methanogenesis was greater contributor to SIR for periphyton than detritus. Inorganic P addition stimulated CO and CH production for periphyton but not detritus, indicating a P limitation in the interior areas of WCA-2a. Continued nutrient loading into oligotrophic areas of WCA-2a or enhanced internal nutrient cycling may stimulate organic matter decomposition and further contribute to undesirable changes to the Everglades ecosystem caused by nutrient enrichment.
1469458|We examined changes in the biogeochemistry of trace metals following a commercial whole-tree harvest (WTH) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. Within 6 months after completion of the WTH, maximum streamwater concentrations of Ni, Cd, Ba, Sr, Mn, Zn and Fe increased two- to nine-fold. Streamwater concentration of Cu remained unchanged after harvest. Streamwater pH decreased from 5.2 to 4.5 after the harvest, and correlated strongly with trace metal concentrations except for Fe. The decrease in pH apparently resulted from increased nitrogen mineralization and nitrification following harvest. All streamwater metal concentrations (except Mn and Fe) in the disturbed watershed increased prior to the decrease in streamwater pH, suggesting that the loss of readily exchangeable metals, not increased mineral dissolution, was responsible for the initial increase in streamwater trace metal concentrations. In contrast, streamwater Mn concentrations did not increase until streamwater pH dropped to 4.5, due in part to increased mineral dissolution. Although pH related strongly to trace metal concentrations in the harvested watershed, it did not account for much of the variation in metal concentrations in the reference (W6) watershed. Annual flux of trace metals increased two- to eight-fold following WTH. Annual losses of Mn and Sr were 14% and 12% respectively of the forest floor pool for each element, and less than 10% of forest floor pools for all other elements. Except for Cd and Cu, annual trace metal losses in streamwater exceeded annual inputs in bulk precipitation.
4151495|Siderophores in soil solution of coniferous forest soils have been chemically identified for the first time. We have identified the siderophores ferrichrome and ferricrocin in soil solution of the upper organic layer by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Mass Spectrometry (MS). The soil solutions were sampled from mor layers of podzolic soils from the south and the north of Sweden and from a mor layer overlying granitic rock and intensively colonised by ectomycorrhizal hyphae. Ferrichrome was found in nanomolar concentrations in all soil solutions investigated and ferricrocin only in the soil solution from the mor layer covering a rock and in the soil solution from the north of Sweden. The findings are discussed in relation to the possible role of fungal hyphae and siderophores in weathering minerals in podzolic soils under coniferous forests. Citric and oxalic acid are able to dissolve minerals via complexation of cations from the mineral. Siderophores should be, kinetically and thermo-dynamically, even more efficient complexing agents for trivalent cations than oxalic and citric acid. The present study provides direct evidence for the presence of siderophores in soil solution.
1469819| Samples of background air were collected in the lower troposphere of the Northern (high Arctic, northern Ontario, Vancouver and Houston) and Southern (Baring Head, New Zealand) Hemispheres over the period July 1999 until March 2001. These samples were analysed for the stable carbon isotope ratios of 1,1,1-trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC113) and CH<sub>3</sub>Cl using a gas chromatography-continuous flow on-line combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry combination. For CH<sub>3</sub>Cl the global average of the stable carbon isotope ratio is -36.2  0.3 (error of mean). The average is based on 78 data points, standard deviation for all measurements is 2.3, and the 90% confidence interval is -35.8 to -36.6. However, the number of data points from the Southern Hemisphere is rather limited and thus this observation is not necessarily representative for the entire Southern Hemisphere. A simple isotopic budget of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl shows the most important parameters needing to be defined are the kinetic isotope effect of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl destruction by OH radicals and the source composition of CH<sub>3</sub>Cl emitted by the oceans and biomass burning of C-4 plants. Present budgets of atmospheric CH<sub>3</sub>Cl show a significant deficit in the source strength. We estimate that the average stable carbon isotope ratio of the additional CH<sub>3</sub>Cl emissions required to balance the budget is -41.9  7.8. The average CFC113 isotopic composition based on 38 measurements is -23.3  1.6 (error of mean),  = 9.6 with no significant difference between the hemispheres. 
1469320|A bioenergetics-based model was used to investigate the effects of temperature, growth and dietary exposure on methylmercury dynamics in walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from two lakes sampled in northwestern Ontario. Orange Lake was smaller, warmer, had slower fish growth and higher mercury concentrations in yearling yellow perch and walleye (three fold difference in 40 cm walleye) than Trout Lake. The model was applied to test the hypothesis that higher water temperatures in Orange Lake increased metabolic needs, food consumption and mercury uptake in fish. The effects of different growths rates in the lakes were also considered. Temperature/metabolic effects and growth effects on internal methylmercury dynamics in walleye and perch were predicted to occur but be of secondary importance. Different dietary exposure to methylmercury was likely the dominant source of variation in fish mercury concentrations between the two lakes.
41410547|We investigated NO and CH fluxes from soils of Quercus ilex, Quercus pyrenaica and Pinus sylvestris stands located in the surrounding area of Madrid (Spain). The fluxes were measured for 18 months from both mature stands and post fire stands using the static chamber technique. Simultaneously with gas fluxes, soil temperature, soil water content, soil C and soil N were measured in the stands. Nitrous oxide fluxes ranged from  11.43 to 8.34 g NO-N m h in Q. ilex, -7.74 to 13.52 g NO-N m h in Q. pyrenaica and -28.17 to 21.89 g NO-N m h in P. sylvestris. Fluxes of CH ranged from -8.12 to 4.11 g CH- C m h in Q.ilex, -7.74 to 3.0 g CH -C m h in Q. pyrenaica and  24.46 to 6.07 g CH-C m h in P. sylvestris. Seasonal differences were detected; NO fluxes being higher in wet months whereas NO fluxes declined in dry months. Net consumption of NO was related to low N availability, high soil C contents, high soil temperatures and low moisture content. Fire decreased NO fluxes in spring. NO emissions were closely correlated with previous day's rainfall and soil moisture. Our ecosystems generally were a sink for methane in the dry season and a source of CH during wet months. The available water in the soil influenced the observed seasonal trend. The burned sites showed higher CH oxidation rates in Q. ilex, and lower rates in P. sylvestris. Overall, the data suggest that fire alters both NO and CH fluxes. However, the magnitude of such variation depends on the site, soil characteristics and seasonal climatic conditions.
20519822|The alteration of the nitrogen (N) cycle by human activities is widespread and has often resulted in increased flows of nitrogen to the marine environment. In this paper we have attempted to know the changes of N fluxes in Cuba by quantifying the N inputs to the landscape from (1) fertilizer applications, (2) atmospheric deposition, (3) biological nitrogen fixation and (4) net import of food and feeds. N-inputs to the country progressively increased until the end of the 20th century, reaching a peak during the 80s when low cost fertilizer imported from the former Soviet Union led to heavy rates of application. This rapid growth represented more than a 5-fold increase with respect to pristine values; higher than the two-fold global increase of anthropogenic N reported by Vitousek et al. (1997 Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle: sources and consequences. Ecol. Appl. 7:737-750). Inorganic fertilizer was the largest single source of reactive N, followed by atmospheric deposition, biological fixation, and net imports of foods and feedstocks. Nitrogen inputs peaked in 1987 and data expressed on an area basis show that N flux to the Cuban landscape, in the 80s, was one of the highest reported in the literature. During the 90s, there was a dramatic drop in nitrogen inputs mainly associated to a decrease in the use of inorganic fertilizer. Other factors reducing nutrient inflows to Cuba, during the same period, were imports of foodstuff and livestock feeds, a decrease of nitrogen oxide emissions, and a decrease in the sugar cane crop area. Using an empirical relationship (Howarth et al. 1996 Regional nitrogen budgets and riverine N & O fluxes for the drainages to the North Atlantic Ocean: Natural and human influences. Biogeochemistry 35:75-139) we present a very preliminary estimate of N-inputs to coastal waters and discuss the consequences of these changes on the coastal zone.
1468827| Spatial variations in nitrogen availability were studied in a desert community codominated by Larrea tridentata (DC.) Cov. and Prosopis glandulosa Torr. Measurements of natural  <sup>15</sup>N values in tissues suggested that Prosopis obtains approximately half of its nitrogen through direct symbiotic fixation. Soils were collected under 1) Prosopis shrubs, 2) Larrea shrubs  2 m from Prosopis (LP), and 3) Larrea  2 m from other Larrea but > 5 m from the nearest Prosopis (LL). Prosopis soils showed significantly higher rates of nitrogen mineralization than LL soils in both A and B horizons. Rates of mineralization in LP soils were significantly higher than rates in LL soils only in the B horizon and were not significantly different from rates in Prosopis soils. Leaf nitrogen concentrations were significantly higher in LP shrubs (2.06%) than in LL shrubs (1.78%), although  <sup>15</sup>N values did not differ between the two shrub types. Nitrogen concentrations in Perezia nana Gray, a perennial herb, were greater in plants under Prosopis shrubs (2.09%) than under LP shrubs (1.93%) or LL shrubs (1.67%). Despite apparent differences in nitrogen availability, biomass of Larrea and density of Perezia did not differ significantly among these sites. 
1469879|Both terrestrial and marine forces drive underground fluid flows in the coastal zone. Hydraulic gradients on land result in groundwater seepage near shore and may contribute to flows further out on the shelf from confined aquifers. Marine processes such as tidal pumping and current-induced pressure gradients may induce interfacial fluid flow anywhere on the shelf where permeable sediments are present. The terrestrial and oceanic forces overlap spatially so measured fluid advection through coastal sediments may be a result of composite forcing. We thus define "submarine groundwater discharge" (SGD) as any and all flow of water on continental margins from the seabed to the coastal ocean, regardless of fluid composition or driving force. SGD is typically characterized by low specific flow rates that make detection and quantification difficult. However, because such flows occur over very large areas, the total flux is significant. Discharging fluids, whether derived from land or composed of re-circulated seawater, will react with sediment components. These reactions may increase substantially the concentrations of nutrients, carbon, and metals in the fluids. These fluids are thus a source of biogeochemically important constituents to the coastal ocean. Terrestrially-derived fluids represent a pathway for new material fluxes to the coastal zone. This may result in diffuse pollution in areas where contaminated groundwaters occur. This paper presents an historical context of SGD studies, defines the process in a form that is consistent with our current understanding of the driving forces as well as our assessment techniques, and reviews the estimated global fluxes and biogeochemical implications. We conclude that to fully characterize marine geochemical budgets, one must give due consideration to SGD. New methodologies, technologies, and modeling approaches are required to discriminate among the various forces that drive SGD and to evaluate these fluxes more precisely.
1468718|Patterns and rates of wetland methane emissions and their sensitivity to potential climate change are critical components of the global methane cycle. In this study, we use empirical simulation models to investigate these processes in floodplain swamps of the Ogeechee River in Georgia, U.S.A. We developed statistical models that relate methane emissions to monthly climate and river flow based on field observations of methane emissions from this system made during 1987-1989. Models were then applied to observed climate and hydrograph for 1937-1989 and to simulated altered climates. Altered climates were generated from the present-day climate by changing monthly temperatures by a constant amount and/or changing monthly precipitation by a constant proportion, thus altering long-term averages and preserving year-to-year variation. Under the present-day climate regime, simulated methane emissions were variable between years and responded very strongly to changes in river discharge. The long-term average was 27 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, with no significant linear trend over the model period. In the altered climate simulations, methane emissions were very sensitive to changes in precipitation amounts, with a 20% decrease in rainfall resulting in 30-43% declines in methane emissions. Predicted effects of temperature changes on methane emissions were less consistent, and were strongly dependent on assumptions made about the response of evapotranspiration to elevated temperatures. In general, hydrologic impacts of changes in evapotranspiration rates (such as may occur in response to temperature shifts) were more important than direct temperature effects on methane production.
1469131|Based on field measurements in two agricultural ecosystems, soil respiration and long-term response of soil organic carbon content (SOC) was modelled. The model predicts the influence of temperature increase as well as the effects of land-use over a period of thirty years in a northern German glacial moraine landscape. One of the fields carried a maize monoculture treated with cattle slurry in addition to mineral fertilizer ("maize monoculture"), the other was managed by crop rotation and recieved organic manure ("crop rotation"). The soils of both fields were classified as cambic Arenosols. The soil respiration was measured in the fields by means of the open dynamic inverted-box method and an infrared gas analyser. The mean annual soil respiration rates were 268 (maize monoculture) and 287 mg CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> (crop rotation). Factors controlling soil respiration were soil temperature, soil moisture, root respiration and carbon input into the soil. Q<sub>10</sub>-values of soil respiration were generally higher in winter than in summer. This trend is interpreted as an adaptive response of the soil microbial communities. In the model a novel mathematical approach with variable Q<sub>10</sub>-values as a result of temperature and moisture adjustment is proposed. With the calibrated model soil respiration and SOC were calculated for both fields and simulations over a period of thirty years were established. Simulations were based on (1) local climatic data, 1961 until 1990, and (2) a regional climate scenario for northern Germany with an average temperature increase of 2.1 K. Over the thirty years period with present climate conditions, the SOC pool under "crop rotation" was nearly stable due to the higher carbon inputs, whereas about 16 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> were lost under "maize monoculture". Under global warming the mean annual soil respiration for both fields increased and SOC decreased by ca. 10 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> under "crop rotation" and by more than 20 t C ha<sup>-1</sup> under "maize monoculture". It was shown that overestimation of carbon losses in long-term prognoses can be avoided by including a Q<sub>10</sub>-adjustment in soil respiration models.
1468657|Winter fluxes of methane were investigated in northern Minnesota during 1988-89 and 1989-90. Two bogs and a fen emitted methane throughout the snow-covered season (November through March). Fluxes decreased to a low level of 3-16 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in late March, reflecting decreasing peat temperatures and (in 1989-90) increasing depth of frost in the peat. Winter fluxes calculated by integration for an open poor fen, an open bog, a forested bog hollow, and a hummock site in the forested bog averaged 49, 12, 13, and 5 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in 1989-90 (the year most measurements were made). These comprised 11%, 4%, 15%, and 21% of total annual flux.
1468670|Elemental concentrations of above- and belowground tissues were determined in an Abies amabilis stand in the Cascade Mountains, Washington, USA. These data were used to calculate the pools and circulation of trace elements and micronutrients on a stand level. For all elements except Al, a greater proportion (from 62 to 87%) was distributed in above- rather than belowground tissues. This contrasted sharply with the biocirculation of elements where 97% of the Al and Fe, 88% of the Cu and 67-84% of the Ca, P, and Mg of total detrital cycling was from the belowground components. Aboveground tissues, however, contributed 69% of the Zn, 65% of the K and 68% of the Mn found in annual detritus production. The proportion of total element pool circulated annually was the highest for Al (82%) and Fe (32%) followed by 13% and less for the remaining elements. Copper, Fe and Al were accumulated in root tissues, while Mn and Zn accumulated in foliage. We hypothesize that roots are an effective mechanism for avoiding Al toxicity in these subalpine ecosystems. The large root biomasses of these stands allow for high Al levels to be taken up and immobilized in roots; this is observed in the significantly higher Al accumulations in below- than aboveground tissues. The high root turnover in these stands is hypothesized to be a result of root senescence occurring in response to high Al accumulation. Furthermore, Al inputs into detritus production occur by soil horizon so that roots with high Al concentrations located in the Bhs horizon turnover and are retained within that horizon. These roots also decompose very slowly (99% decay = 456 years) due to the high Al and low Ca, Mn and Mg present in these tissues and therefore have very little impact on short-term elemental cycling.
1468697| A popular sequential extraction procedure (Tessier et al. 1979) designed to extract metals partitioned in various sediment phases, was evaluated for its selectivity. Amorphous FeOOH, FeS, and FeS<sub>2</sub> were added separately to natural lake sediments and sequentially extracted. The selectivity of the sequential procedure for the added solid phases was evaluated by determining the difference in the mass of Fe extracted from treated and control sediments. In the experiments where sulfide minerals were added, total S was measured in the residual solids in order to confirm selectivity of the method. Concentrations of total carbon remaining in the solid phase after each extraction step were also measured to determine the selectivity of the sequential procedure for carbon. The procedure was moderately selective for Fe added as FeOOH; a mean of 77  12% (p < 0.05) of the Fe added was extracted in the step designed to reduce Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides. In experiments where FeS was added, a mean of 69  11% (p < 0.05) of the Fe added as FeS was extracted in the fraction designed to oxidize sulfides and organic matter. Approximately 25% of the Fe added as FeS may have been extracted prematurely. Although less precise, total S analyses confirmed that much of the FeS was extracted in the oxidation step, yielding 104  87% (p < 0.05) of the S added as FeS. The procedure was highly selective for FeS<sub>2</sub>; 92  14% (p < 0.05) of the Fe added as pyrite was extracted in the sulfide extraction step. Extraction of 80  54% (p < 0.05) of S added as pyrite confirmed that FeS<sub>2</sub> were selectively extracted in the sulfide extraction step. Carbon in the sediments was also selectively extracted in the oxidation step (77  2.4% of total C; p < 0.05). The applications and limitations of sequential extraction procedures as limnological research tools are discussed in light of our results. 
20055186|Over two-thirds of terrestrial carbon is stored belowground and a significant amount of atmospheric CO is respired by roots and microbes in soils. For this analysis, soil respiration (Rs) data were assembled from 31 AmeriFlux and CarboEurope sites representing deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf, grasslands, mixed deciduous/evergreen and woodland/savanna ecosystem types. Lowest to highest rates of soil respiration averaged over the growing season were grassland and woodland/savanna &lt deciduous broadleaf forests &lt evergreen needleleaf, mixed deciduous/evergreen forests with growing season soil respiration significantly different between forested and non-forested biomes (p &lt 0.001). Timing of peak respiration rates during the growing season varied from March/April in grasslands to July-September for all other biomes. Biomes with overall strongest relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature were from the deciduous and mixed forests (R  0.65). Maximum soil respiration was weakly related to maximum fine root biomass (R = 0.28) and positively related to the previous years' annual litterfall (R = 0.46). Published rates of annual soil respiration were linearly related to LAI and fine root carbon (R = 0.48, 0.47), as well as net primary production (NPP) (R = 0.44). At 10 sites, maximum growing season Rs was weakly correlated with annual GPP estimated from eddy covariance towersites (R = 0.29; p &lt 0.05), and annual soil respiration and total growing season Rs were not correlated with annual GPP (p &gt 0.1). Yet, previous studies indicate correlations on shorter time scales within site (e.g., weekly, monthly). Estimates of annual GPP from the Biome-BGC model were strongly correlated with observed annual estimates of soil respiration for six sites (R = 0.84; p &lt 0.01). Correlations from observations of Rs with NPP, LAI, fine root biomass and litterfall relate above and belowground inputs to labile pools that are available for decomposition. Our results suggest that simple empirical relationships with temperature and/or moisture that may be robust at individual sites may not be adequate to characterize soil CO effluxes across space and time, agreeing with other multi-site studies. Information is needed on the timing and phenological controls of substrate availability (e.g., fine roots, LAI) and inputs (e.g., root turnover, litterfall) to improve our ability to accurately quantify the relationships between soil CO effluxes and carbon substrate storage.
1469804|Simulated acid rain at pH 3.3, 4.3 and 5.3 has been applied by overhead spraying to reconstructed soil profiles and young Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) trees in pots to assess the effect of rainfall acidity on the fate and recycling efficiency of Mn from <sup>54</sup>Mn-labelled Sitka spruce litter. The concentration of <sup>54</sup>Mn in throughfall was significantly increased by acidification of the rain, but <sup>54</sup>Mn activity in drainage water remained low and was not significantly affected. The fact that only < 1.5% of <sup>54</sup>Mn was lost in drainage water suggests that forest ecosystems efficiently retain Mn, at least in the short term. The bulk of <sup>54</sup>Mn (approximately 60 to 70%) was retained in the litter layer. Compared with rain at pH 4.3, rain at pH 3.3 acidified L/F and H/A horizon soils. The amount of <sup>54</sup>Mn found in the different soil horizons was only influenced significantly by rainfall acidity in the E horizon soil, however, where <sup>54</sup>Mn activity was increased by the most acid treatment. The activity of <sup>54</sup>Mn in Sitka spruce needles did not differ significantly with treatments.
20456480|Over the years, viruses have been shown to be mortality agents for a wide range of phytoplankton species, including species within the genus Phaeocystis (Prymnesiophyceae). With its polymorphic life cycle, its worldwide distribution, and the capacity of several of the Phaeocystis species to form dense blooms, this genus is a key player for our understanding of biogeochemical cycling of elements. This paper provides an overview of what is know to date about the ecological role of viruses in regulating Phaeocystis population dynamics. It explores which variables affect the algal host--virus interactions, and examines the impact of virally induced cell lysis of Phaeocystis on the function and structure of the pelagic food web as well as on the flow of organic carbon and nutrients.
1468615|Iron monosulfides are important intermediates in pyrite formation, and are operationally defined as sulfides soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid. A number of variations are currently employed in their isolation and quantification. In this study, the active distillation of acid volatile sulfide from sediment samples was studied to determine the effects of stannous chloride and heat. The addition of SnCl<sub>2</sub> caused recovery of sulfide to increase by 20% during distillations performed at room temperature. If distillations with SnCl<sub>2</sub> were then heated and boiled, recovery increased by up to 100%. Tests with 98% pure pyrite and elemental sulfur showed that these compounds were reduced to sulfide in solutions of 15% and 20% SnCl<sub>2</sub> in boiling 6N HCl, and that these reactions were grain size dependent. The compounds were not significantly reduced by solutions of SnCl<sub>2</sub> at room temperature, or by boiling 6N HCl not containing SnCl<sub>2</sub>.
24715353|Forest soils represent a significant pool for carbon sequestration and storage, but the factors controlling soil carbon cycling are not well constrained. We compared soil carbon dynamics at five broadleaf forests in the Eastern US that vary in climate, soil type, and soil ecology: two sites at the University of Michigan Biological Station (MI-Coarse, sandy; MI-Fine, loamy); Bartlett Experimental Forest (NH-BF); Harvard Forest (MA-HF); and Baskett Wildlife Recreation and Education Area (MO-OZ). We quantified soil carbon stocks and measured bulk soil radiocarbon to at least 60 cm depth. We determined surface (015 cm) soil carbon distribution and turnover times in free light (unprotected), occluded light (intra-aggregate), and dense (mineral-associated) soil fractions. Total soil carbon stocks ranged from 55  4 to 229  42 Mg C ha and were lowest at MI-Coarse and MO-OZ and highest at MI-Fine and NH-BF. Differences in climate only partly explained differences in soil organic matter C and mean turnover times, which were 75260 year for free-light fractions, 70625 year for occluded-light fractions, and 90480 year for dense fractions. Turnover times were shortest at the warmest site, but longest at the northeastern sites (NH-BF and MA-HF), rather than the coldest sites (MI-Coarse and MI-Fine). Soil texture, mineralogy, drainage, and macrofaunal activity may be at least as important as climate in determining soil carbon dynamics in temperate broadleaf forests.
1468552| The Apure River is a major white-water tributary of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. The Apure is rich in solutes; its contribution to dissolved inorganic solids in the Orinoco (24%) is proportionately much greater than its contribution to discharge (6%). About 40% of the calcium and bicarbonate at the mouth of the Orinoco originate in the Apure drainage. The relationship between discharge and the concentrations of major solutes in the Apure was characterized with a two-compartment hyperbolic mixing model. Previous applications of the two-compartment model have been based on separate determinations of the model parameter , which is a constant describing watershed hydrology, for each solute from data on concentrations. The use of a weighted mean  for all solutes is proposed as a means of assessing the importance of processes other than mixing. The model, when used on the Apure data, shows that a strong dilution effect prevails for sodium, calcium, magnesium, sulfate, and bicarbonate, and that a strong purging effect (increase of concentration with increasing discharge) is characteristic of soluble silicon. Biological immobilization of soluble silicon by diatoms during the season of low discharge is sufficiently large to account for the positive relationship between discharge and the concentration of soluble silicon. Specific transport rates of solutes from the basin are generally higher than global averages. In contrast, specific transport of chloride is low. Atmospheric sources control chloride transport in the Apure watershed; the low transport rates of chloride are probably explained by the great distance between the Apure watershed and the oceanic sources of atmospheric chloride. 
40980892|We used established long-term experimental P-amended plots in freshwater marshes of northern Belize to determine the impact of P input on nitrogen (N) fixation. Marshes with different conductivities and sulfate concentrations were selected to elucidate the effect of salinity and the contribution of sulfur reducing bacteria to the overall N fixation. Rates of N fixation in sediment, roots, and cyanobacterial mats was measured in laboratory incubation experiments (acetylene reduction assay calibrated by N reduction assay) with and without the addition of sodium molybdate (sulfur reducing bacteria inhibitor). P has increased macrophyte primary production significantly, which led to the rapid elimination of cyanobacterial mats and the elimination of autotrophic N fixation. P addition enhanced heterotrophic N fixation in both the sediments and rhizosphere due primarily to increased C supply to the sediment. When expressed on a dry weight basis, root associated N fixation was higher than sediment N fixation, but the contribution of the root associated fixation to the total N fixation was small when expressed per square meter. Sulfur reducing bacteria were an important component of N fixation, contributing from 20 to 53% to the overall N fixation. A simple N budget was created to determine if N demands are met following P addition. The heterotrophic N fixation substituted in part for autotrophic cyanobacterial N fixation when P limitation was alleviated.
40800614|The temporal variation in the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of paniculate organic matter (POM) in the Rhone River was investigated on a monthly basis during a 2-year period (20042005). In spite of high month-to-month variation, interannually consistent seasonal trends appeared, with significantly lower C (<28.2) in spring than in the other seasons. In contrast, N did not exhibit significant temporal variation. In spring and summer, high chlorophyll a and b concentrations were associated with low C/N values (< 8) and a high percentage of organic carbon (% C) and organic nitrogen (% N), testifying to high development of autochthonous riverine phytoplankton (mainly diatoms and chlorophytes). In fall and winter, higher C (>27.2% o) and C/N (>8) values, and lower %C, %N, and chlorophylls concentrations indicated the predominance of allochthonous terrestrial detritus material in the river POM. The lower C values recorded in spring-summer, when the phytoplankton biomass was high, were related to the lower carbon isotopic signatures of freshwater diatoms and chlorophytes compared to those of terrestrial plants. Overall, Rhone River POM was mainly composed of terrestrially derived material (90%), with autochthonous phytoplankton representing only 10% as a mean, in spite of a higher mean contribution of phytoplankton (27%) to river POM in summer.
40980880|Key recent developments in litter decomposition research are reviewed. Long-term inter-site experiments indicate that temperature and moisture influence early rates of litter decomposition primarily by determining the plants present, suggesting that climate change effects will be small unless they alter the plant forms present. Thresholds may exist at which single factors control decay rate. Litter decomposes faster where the litter type naturally occurs. Elevated CO concentrations have little effect on litter decomposition rates. Plant tissues are not decay-resistant; it is microbial and biochemical transformations of materials into novel recalcitrant compounds rather than selective preservation of recalcitrant compounds that creates stable organic matter. Altering single characteristics of litter will not substantially alter decomposition rates. Nitrogen addition frequently leads to greater stabilization into humus through a combination of chemical reactions and enzyme inhibition. To sequester more in soil, we need to consider not how to slow decomposition, but rather how to divert more litter into humus through microbial and chemical reactions rather than allowing it to decompose. The optimal strategy is to have litter transformed into humic substances and then chemically or physically protected in mineral soil. Adding N through fertilization and N-fixing plants is a feasible means of stimulating humification.
1468549|Sediment porewaters in the near-shore region (within 1 m of the shoreline) of an acidic lake (Dart's Lake) were monitored during the summer of 1983 to investigate whether spatial variations in porewater acid/base chemistry were significant in this region of the lake. Previous investigations of Dart's Lake porewaters have indicated that within deeper waters (> 2 m depth), sediment porewaters are elevated in alkalinity relative to overlying lake water. Within the near-shore region, porewaters both considerably more and less acidic than the lake water were observed. Both reduction of strong acid anions (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>,NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and the mobilization of base cations were significant mechanisms of alkalinity production in porewaters exhibiting reducing conditions. In sediments reflecting oxic conditions, porewaters were generally more acidic than the lakewater. Measurement of groundwater seepage into the lake at the near-shore sites indicated that oxic sites exhibited elevated inputs of groundwater when compared to sites where reducing conditions existed. The acidic porewaters associated with high groundwater flows suggests that groundwater inputs to the lake may be a source of acidity (not alkalinity) on a whole-lake basis.
1469344|Geostatistical analyses show that the distribution of soil N, P and K is strongly associated with the presence of shrubs in desert habitats. Shrubs concentrate the biogeochemical cycle of these elements in 'islands of fertility' that are localized beneath their canopies, while adjacent barren, intershrub spaces are comparatively devoid of biotic activity. Both physical and biological processes are involved in the formation of shrub islands. Losses of semiarid grassland in favor of invading shrubs initiate these changes in the distribution of soil nutrients, which may promote the further invasion and persistence of shrubs and cause potential feedbacks between desertification and the Earth's climate system.
41490489|Human activities that modify land cover can alter the structure and biogeochemistry of small streams but these effects are poorly known over large regions of the humid tropics where rates of forest clearing are high. We examined how conversion of Amazon lowland tropical forest to cattle pasture influenced the physical and chemical structure, organic matter stocks and N cycling of small streams. We combined a regional ground survey of small streams with an intensive study of nutrient cycling using 15 N additions in three representative streams: a second-order forest stream, a second-order pasture stream and a third-order pasture stream. These three streams were within several km of each other and on similar soils. Replacement of forest with pasture decreased stream habitat complexity by changing streams from run and pool channels with forest leaf detritus (50% cover) to grass-filled (63% cover) channel with runs of slow-moving water. In the survey, pasture streams consistently had lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nitrate (NO) compared with similar-sized forest streams. Stable isotope additions revealed that second-order pasture stream had a shorter NH uptake length, higher uptake rates into organic matter components and a shorter NH residence time than the second-order forest stream or the third-order pasture stream. Nitrification was significant in the forest stream (19% of the added NH) but not in the secondorder pasture (0%) or third-order (6%) pasture stream. The forest stream retained 7% of added 15 N in organic matter compartments and exported 53% (NH = 34%; NO = 19%).). In contrast, the second-order pasture stream retained 75% of added N, predominantly in grasses (69%) and exported only 4% as NH. The fate of tracer N in the third-order pasture stream more closely resembled that in the forest stream, with 5% of added N retained and 26% exported (NH = 9%; NO = 6%). These findings indicate that the widespread infilling by grass in small streams in areas deforested for pasture greatly increases the retention of inorganic N in the first-and second-order streams, which make up roughly three-fourths of total stream channel length in Amazon basin watersheds. The importance of this phenomenon and its effect on N transport to larger rivers across the larger areas of the Amazon Basin will depend on better evaluation of both the extent and the scale at which stream infilling by grass occurs, but our analysis suggests the phenomenon is widespread.
1469227|Five large rivers that discharge on the western North Atlantic continental shelf carry about 45% of the nitrogen (N) and 70% of the phosphorus (P) that others estimate to be the total flux of these elements from the entire North Atlantic watershed, including North, Central and South America, Europe, and Northwest Africa. We estimate that 61 10<sup>9</sup> moles y<sup>-1</sup> of N and 20 10<sup>9</sup> moles y<sup>-1</sup> of P from the large rivers are buried with sediments in their deltas, and that an equal amount of N and P from the large rivers is lost to the shelf through burial of river sediments that are deposited directly on the continental slope. The effective transport of active N and P from land to the shelf through the very large rivers is thus reduced to 292 10<sup>9</sup> moles y<sup>-1</sup> of N and 13 10<sup>9</sup> moles y<sup>-1</sup> of P. The remaining riverine fluxes from land must pass through estuaries. An analysis of annual total N and total P budgets for various estuaries around the North Atlantic revealed that the net fractional transport of these nutrients through estuaries to the continental shelf is inversely correlated with the log mean residence time of water in the system. This is consistent with numerous observations of nutrient retention and loss in temperate lakes. Denitrification is the major process responsible for removing N in most estuaries, and the fraction of total N input that is denitrified appears to be directly proportional to the log mean water residence time. In general, we estimate that estuarine processes retain and remove 30-65% of the total N and 10-55% of the total P that would otherwise pass into the coastal ocean. The resulting transport through estuaries to the shelf amounts to 172-335 10<sup>9</sup> moles y<sup>-1</sup> of N and 11-9 10<sup>9</sup> moles y<sup>-1</sup> of P. These values are similar to the effective contribution from the large rivers that discharge directly on the shelf. For the North Atlantic shelf as a whole, N fluxes from major rivers and estuaries exceed atmospheric deposition by a factor of 3.5-4.7, but this varies widely among regions of the shelf. For example, on the U.S. Atlantic shelf and on the northwest European shelf, atmospheric deposition of N may exceed estuarine exports. Denitrification in shelf sediments exceeds the combined N input from land and atmosphere by a factor of 1.4-2.2. This deficit must be met by a flux of N from the deeper ocean. Burial of organic matter fixed on the shelf removes only a small fraction of the total N and P input (2-12% of N from land and atmosphere; 1-17% of P), but it may be a significant loss for P in the North Sea and some other regions. The removal of N and P in fisheries landings is very small. The gross exchange of N and P between the shelf and the open ocean is much larger than inputs from land and, for the North Atlantic shelf as a whole, it may be much larger than the N and P removed through denitrification, burial, and fisheries. Overall, the North Atlantic continental shelf appears to remove some 700-950 10<sup>9</sup> moles of N each year from the deep ocean and to transport somewhere between 18 and 30 10<sup>9</sup> moles of P to the open sea. If the N and P associated with riverine sediments deposited on the continental slope are included in the total balance, the net flux of N to the shelf is reduced by 60 10<sup>9</sup> moles y<sup>-1</sup> and the P flux to the ocean is increased by 20 10<sup>9</sup> moles y<sup>-1</sup>. These conclusions are quite tentative, however, because of large uncertainties in our estimates of some important terms in the shelf mass balance.
1469935|The down-slope movement of water and nutrients should link plant and soil processes along hill slopes. This linkage ought to be particularly strong in Arctic ecosystems where permafrost confines flowing water near the surface. We examined whether these hill-slope processes are important in assessments of the responses of Arctic tundra to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> and climate using the Marine Biological Laboratory-General Ecosystem Model. Because higher rates of water flow decrease the distance over which nutrients must diffuse to the roots, down-slope vegetation is more productive under current conditions. In response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and a warmer, wetter climate, the relative increase in carbon stored in vegetation and soils was higher uphill, but the absolute increase was higher downhill. Very little of the increase in carbon anywhere on the hill slope resulted from an increase in total ecosystem nitrogen. Instead, the increases were associated with increases in vegetation C:N ratio (woodiness) and with the redistribution of nitrogen from soils (low C:N) to vegetation (high C:N). Because these changes are fueled by nitrogen already in place, the down-slope movement of nitrogen does not appear to be a major determinant of the responses of Arctic tundra to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> and climate.
23359710|The enzyme product of the dddD gene, found in several different marine bacteria, acts on dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), liberating dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and generating 3-OH-propionate as the initially detected C3 product. In many bacteria, dddD is near genes whose sequence suggests that they encode a DMSP transporter. These are of two very different types, in the BCCT (betaine-carnitine-choline transporter) family or resembling members of the ABC super-family that import betaines. Even within these two families, the amino acid sequences of these putative transporters are not particularly similar to each other. Genes for the predicted DMSP transporters of Halomonas and Marinomonas (both BCCT type) and of Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD (ABC-type) were each cloned and introduced into an Escherichia coli mutant (MKH13) that is defective in betaine uptake, and so fails to catabolise DMSP even when a cloned dddD gene was present, due to the failure of the substrate to be imported. DMSP-dependent DMS production (Ddd + phenotype) was restored by introducing any of these cloned transporters into MKH13 containing dddD. Other marine bacteria use a range of enzymes, called DddL, DddP, DddQ, DddW and DddY, to cleave DMSP, but the various ddd genes that encode them are usually unlinked to any that are predicted to encode betaine transporters. We identified one gene in Sulfitobacter sp. EE-36 and two in Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM, which, when cloned and introduced into E. coli MKH13, overcame its osmotic sensitivity when it was grown with DMSP or other exogenous betaines. These genes all encoded BCCT transporters, but were unlinked to any known genes involved in DMSP catabolism in these two strains of -proteobacteria.
1469156|Fires in the tallgrass prairie are frequent and significantly alter nutrient cycling processes. We evaluated the short-term changes in plant production and microbial activity due to fire and the long-term consequences of annual burning on soil organic matter (SOM), plant production, and nutrient cycling using a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling studies. In the short-term, fire in the tallgrass prairie enhances microbial activity, increases both above- and belowground plant production, and increases nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). However, repeated annual burning results in greater inputs of lower quality plant residues causing a significant reduction in soil organic N, lower microbial biomass, lower N availability, and higher C:N ratios in SOM. Changes in amount and quality of belowground inputs increased N immobilization and resulted in no net increases in N availability with burning. This response occurred rapidly (e.g., within two years) and persisted during 50 years of annual burning. Plant production at a long-term burned site was not adversely affected due to shifts in plant NUE and carbon allocation. Modeling results indicate that the tallgrass ecosystem responds to the combined changes in plant resource allocation and NUE. No single factor dominates the impact of fire on tallgrass plant production.
41490558|Knowledge of import, export, and transport of nitrogen (N) in headwater catchments is essential for understanding ecosystem function and water quality in mountain ecosystems, especially as these ecosystems experience increased anthropogenic N deposition. In this study, we link spatially explicit soil and stream data at the landscape scale to investigate import, export and transport of N in a 0.89 km site at the alpine-subalpine ecotone in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, U.S.A. For two of the major N inputs to our site, N deposition in the snowpack and N fixation, a complementary relationship was found across the study site, with greater abundance of N-fixing plants in areas with less snow and substantial snow inputs in areas with low N fixer abundance. During the initial phases of snowmelt, mixing model end members for oxygen isotopes in nitrate (NO) indicated that a substantial quantity of NO is transported downhill into the forested subalpine without being assimilated by soil microbes. After this initial pulse, much less NO entered the stream and most but not all of it was microbial in origin. Rising N in stream NO indicated greater influence of fractionating processes such as denitrification later in the season. NO from both atmospheric and microbial sources was not exported from our site because it was consumed within the first several hundred meters of the stream; ultimately, N exports were in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and paniculate N (PN). The results of this study suggest that the highest elevation dry alpine meadows rely more heavily on N fixation as an N source and experience less of the effects of anthropogenic N deposition than mid and lower elevation areas that have more snow. Our data also suggest that mid-elevation krummholz, moist meadows, and talus slopes are exporting N as NO shortly after the onset of snowmelt, but that this NO is rapidly consumed as the stream flows through the subalpine forest. This consumption by assimilation and/or denitrification currently provides a buffer against increased inorganic N availability downstream.

1469193|Nutrient dynamics of large grassland ecosystems possessing abundant migratory grazers are poorly understood. We examined N cycling on the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park, home for large herds of free-roaming elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison). Plant and soil N, net N mineralization, and the deposition of ungulate fecal-N were measured at five sites, a ridgetop, mid-slope bench, steep slope, valley-bottom bench, and riparian area, within a watershed from May, 1991 to April, 1992. Results indicated similarities between biogeochemical properties of Yellowstone grassland and other grassland ecosystems: (1) landscape position and soil water affected nutrient dynamics, (2) annual mineralization was positively related to soil N content, and (3) the proportion of soil N mineralized during the year was negatively related to soil C/N. Grazers were a particularly important component of the N budget of this grassland. Estimated rates of N flow from ungulates to the soil ranged from 8.1 to 45.6 kg/ha/yr at the sites (average = 27.0 kg/ha/yr), approximately 4.5 times the amount of N in senescent plants. Rates of nitrogen mineralization for Yellowstone northern range grassland were higher than those measured in other temperate grassland ecosystems, possibly due to grazers promoting N cycling in Yellowstone.
20055176|Organically bound species have been identified as prominent and mobile forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in soils. Since a large portion of sulphur (S) in soil is bonded to carbon (C) also dissolved organic S likely is a significant constituent in soil water. To investigate the role of dissolved organic forms in leaching and cycling of S in forest soils, we examined concentrations, fluxes, and chemical composition of organic S in forest floor leachates and in soil solutions of Rendzic Leptosols under 90-year-old European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Haplic Arenosols under 160-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) for 27 months. These soils are low in adsorbed $\text{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ and receive little atmospheric S depositions at present. The chemical composition of organic S was estimated by fractionation with XAD-8 and wet-chemical characterisation (HI reduction) of binding forms. Although not as prominent as the organic forms of other nutrient elements, organic S proved to be an important contributor to S dissolved in forest floor leachates and in mineral soil solutions. Dissolved organic matter contained on average 29% of total S in forest floor leachates at the pine site and 34% at the beech site. The largest portion of organic S occurred in the subsoil solutions under beech in summer and autumn (up to 53%). Mean concentrations of organic S peaked (up to 1.1 mg $\text{l}^{-1}$) in summer after rainstorms that followed dry periods. Fluxes with forest floor leachates and at 90 cm soil depth were largest in autumn because of huge amounts of rainfall. Organic S contributed significantly to the fluxes of S in the subsoils under beech comprising on average 39% of total dissolved S at 90 cm depth. Organic S produced in the forest floor layers was mainly in the hydrophilic fraction of dissolved organic matter (62  6% at the pine site, 85  4% at the beech site). The major binding form of organic S in the hydrophobic fraction was C-bonded S while in the hydrophilic fraction ester sulphate S, possibly associated with carbohydrates, was more prominent. Since the hydrophobic fraction increased in summer and autumn, C-bonded S was of greater importance during that time of the year than in winter and spring. With depth, concentrations and composition of organic S (and also of C) hardly changed at the pine site because of little retention of dissolved organic matter, presumably because of the small sorption capability of that soil. At the beech where organic C showed a marked decrease with depth, only a slight decrease in organic S, exclusively from the hydrophobic fraction, was found indicating that organic S was mobile compared with organic C. This was probably due to the concentration of S in the hydrophilic fraction of dissolved organic matter. Because of being concentrated in the mobile hydrophilic fraction, ester sulphate S was more mobile in the soil under beech than C-bonded S.
40343598|The aim of this study was to analyze C and N dynamics, as well as, soil bacterial community structure within soil micro-and macro-aggregates in a tropical deciduous forest in Mxico. We measured, for three landscape positions and three seasons of the year: total, microbial and available forms of C and N; potential C and N mineralization; and soil bacterial communities by using t-RFLPs. The highest total C concentrations were found in the north-slopes and in the dry season (DS) samples. In general, microaggregates had higher concentrations than macroaggregates of available C and N forms, and microbial C. Similarly, micro-aggregates had the highest potential C mineralization and net N mineralization. We detected 149 different OTUs (operational taxonomic units) from which 50% was shared by the two aggregate size fractions, 25% was exclusive to micro-aggregates and the 25% left was found only in macro-aggregates. Top-hills were richer in OTUs than north and south-slopes. The Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis indicated clear differences in community composition between the two aggregate size-fractions in relation to the presence of OTUs. These results suggest that the main difference between micro-and macro-aggregates is due to the community structure within each soil fraction and this difference could affect soil nutrients dynamics.
1469173| Field measures of tree and shrub dimensions were used with established biomass equations in a stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design to estimate above-ground oven-dry woody biomass and carbon storage of the eastern deciduous forest of North America. Biomass averaged 8.1  1.4 (95% C.I.) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and totaled 18.1  3.1 (95% C.I.) gigatons. Carbon storage averaged 3.6  0.6 (95% C.I.) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and totaled 8.1  1.4 (95% C.I.) gigatons. These values are lower than previous estimates commonly used in the analysis of the global carbon budget which range from 17.1 to 23.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for biomass and 7.7 to 10.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for carbon storage. These new estimates for the deciduous forest, together with earlier work in the boreal forest begin to reveal a pattern of overestimation of global carbon storage by vegetation in analyses of the global carbon budget. We discuss reasons for the differences between the new and earlier estimates, as well as implications for our understanding of the global carbon cycle. 
1468607|Big Moose L. has become significantly more acidic since the 1950s, based on paleolimnological analyses of sediment cores. Reconstruction of past lakewater pH using diatom assemblage data indicates that from prior to 1800 to ca. 1950, lakewater pH was about 5.8. After the mid-1950s, the inferred pH decreased steadily and relatively quickly to about 4.6. Alkalinity reconstructions indicate a decrease of about 30  eq 1<sup>-1</sup> during the same period. There was a major shift in diatom assemblage composition, including a nearly total loss of euplanktonic taxa. Chrysophyte scale assemblages and chironomid (midge larvae) remains also changed in a pattern indicating decreasing lakewater pH starting in the 1950s. Accumulation rates of total Ca, exchangeable and oxide Al, and other metals suggest recent lake-watershed acidification. Cores were dated using <sup>210</sup>Pb, pollen, and charcoal. Indicators of watershed change (deposition rates of Ti, Si, Al) do not suggest any major erosional events resulting from fires or logging. Accumulation rates of materials associated with combustion of fossil fuels (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, coal and oil soot particles, some trace metals, and sulfur) are low until the late 1800s-early 1900s and increase relatively rapidly until the 1920s-1930s. Peak rates occurred between the late 1940s and about 1970, when rates declined. The recent decrease in pH of Big Moose L. cannot be accounted for by natural acidification or processes associated with watershed disturbance. The magnitude, rate and timing of the recent pH and alkalinity decreases, and their relationship to indicators of coal and oil combustion, indicate that the most reasonable explanation for the recent acidification is increased atmospheric deposition of strong acids derived from combustion of fossil fuels.
1468757|Transformations of organic and inorganic S in two forested Spodosols from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire and the Huntington Forest in the Adirondack Mts. of New York were investigated using laboratory <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> incorporation experiments. Sulfur transformations were modeled as a set of three reversible, first-order reactions in which soluble SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is converted to adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, ester sulfate and carbon-bonded S. Reaction rate contants for <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption/desorption and immobilization reactions involving ester sulfate and carbon-bonded S were determined using a fifth order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integration routine combined with least squares fitting. Model simulations were able to account for over 93% of the variation in the distribution of <sup>35</sup>S in S fractions. A hypothetical application of immobilization rate constants to field situations at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest suggests that large quantities of S cycle through organic forms in Northern Hardwood Forest Ecosystems.
1469617|We studied the distribution of dissolved O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O in a coastal swamp system in Thailand with the goal to characterize the dynamics of these gases within the system. The gas concentrations varied spatially and seasonally in both surface and ground waters. The entire system was a strong source for CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, and a possible sink for atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O. Seasonal variation in precipitation primarily regulated the redox conditions in the system. However, distributions of CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O in the river that received swamp waters were not always in agreement with redox conditions indicated by dissolved O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Sulfate production through pyrite oxidation occurred in the swamp with thin peat layer under aerobic conditions and was reflected by elevated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> in the river water. When SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> was high, CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations decreased, whereas the N<sub>2</sub>O concentration increased. The excess SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the river water was thus identified as a potential indicator for gas dynamics in this coastal swamp system.
1469211|Diurnal variation in the rate of methane emission and its relation to water table depth and macro climate was studied in several plant communities within an acid, Sphagnum dominated, mixed mire in Northern Sweden. Provided that diurnal variation in solar radiation and air temperature occurred, methane fluxes differed during day and night. Diurnal patterns in methane emission rates were found to differ among mire plant communities. In relatively dry plant communities (ridges, minerotrophic lawn), the average nighttime emission rates were 2-3 times higher than the daytime rates during the two periods with high diurnal variation in solar radiation and air temperature. Methane emission was significantly (p < 0.05) related to solar radiation and soil temperature at depths of 5 and 10 cm at all sampling points in the dry plant communities. In the wetter plant communities, no significant difference between daytime and nighttime average methane emission rates were found even though methane emissions were significantly related with radiation and soil temperature at approximately 70% of the sampling points. The increased emission rate for methane at night in the comparatively dry plant communities was probably caused by an inhibition of methane oxidation, owing to the lower nighttime temperatures or to a delay in the supply of root-exuded substrate for the anaerobic bacteria, or by both. The pattern observed in the wet plant communities indicated that methane production were positively related either to soil temperature or light-regulated root exudation.
20519875|Microbial bioreduction of radionuclides has been the subject of much recent interest, in particular as a method for the in situ bioremediation of uranium contaminated sites. However, there have been very few studies investigating the microbially mediated redox transformations of plutonium. The redox chemistry of Pu is complicated, but the dominant environmental oxidation state is insoluble Pu(IV). However, microbial reduction of Pu(IV) to more soluble Pu(III) may enhance migration of Pu in the environment. In this study we investigated the effect of two model metal-reducing bacteria, Geobacter sulfurreducens and Shewanella oneidensis, on the redox speciation of Pu. Our results show that in all cases, the presence of bacterial cells enhanced removal of Pu from solution. UV/Visible spectra of cells and precipitates formed (dissolved in 1 M HCl), showed that the sorbed and precipitated Pu was mainly Pu(IV), but Pu(III) was also present. The results suggest that the mechanism of interaction between Pu(IV) and the two microorganisms is initial sorption to the cell surface, followed by slow reduction. Although both bacteria could reduce Pu(IV) to Pu(III), there was no increase in the solution concentrations of Pu. This suggests that the potential reduction of sorbed Pu(IV) in sediments that have been stimulated to bioremediate U(VI) may not result in problematic mobilization of Pu(III).
1468593|An integrated analysis of a terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem, the North Branch of the Moose River in the Adirondack region of New York, was conducted. This basin contains a large number of interconnected surface waters that exhibit marked gradients in pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). As a result, the basin has been the focus of research activity, including the Regional Integrated Lake-Watershed Acidification Study (RILWAS). The objective of the current analysis was to use the North Branch of the Moose River as a case study to: 1. Evaluate processes regulating the acid-base chemistry of surface waters. 2. To assess the effects of surface water acidification on fish populations. The observations of this study were consistent with the model of surface water acidification developed during the Integrated Lake-Watershed Acidification Study (ILWAS). The processes depicted in the original ILWAS simulation model were adequate to describe the acid-base chemistry of surface waters in the North Branch of the Moose River. However, the reduction of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in lake sediments, a process not represented in the original model, proved to be a significant source of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) for some of these waters. As a result, reduction processes were added to the model. Analysis of in-situ bioassay and survey data indicate that acid-sensitive fish species have disappeared from the more acidic areas of the basin over the last half century. Paleoecological analyses indicate that pH has decreased from the high 5's to about 5 in Big Moose Lake during this period. ILWAS model simulations indicate that the pH of Big Moose Lake would increase by at least 0.1 to 0.5 pH units (depending on the season) in response to a 50% reduction in total atmospheric S deposition. Considerable variability in processes regulating acid/base chemistry was evident in the North Branch of the Moose River. Therefore, regional assessments of past or possible future effects of acidic deposition require widespread application of ILWAS theory within the Adirondack region and other potentially acid-sensitive areas.
41490423|Knowledge of the fate of deposited N in the possibly N-limited, highly biodiverse north Andean forests is important because of the possible effects of N inputs on plant performance and species composition. We analyzed concentrations and fluxes of NO  - N, NH  -N and dissolved organic N (DON) in rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, mineral soil solutions (0.15-0.30 m depths) and stream water in a montane forest in Ecuador during four consecutive quarters and used the natural N abundance in NO  during the passage of rain water through the ecosystem and bulk N values in soil to detect N transformations. Depletion of N in NO  and increased NO -N fluxes during the passage through the canopy and the organic layer indicated nitrification in these compartments. During leaching from the organic layer to mineral soil and stream, NO concentrations progressively decreased and were enriched in N but did not reach the N values of solid phase organic matter (N = 5.6-6.7%). This suggested a combination of nitrification and denitrification in mineral soil. In the wettest quarter, the N value of NO   in litter leachate was smaller (N = -1.58%) than in the other quarters (N = -9.38  SE 0.46%) probably because of reduced mineralization and associated fractionation against N. Nitrogen isotope fractionation of NO  between litter leachate and stream water was smaller in the wettest period than in the other periods probably because of a higher rate of denitrification and continuous dilution by isotopically lighter NO -N from throughfall and nitrification in the organic layer during the wettest period. The stable N isotope composition of NO  gave valuable indications of N transformations during the passage of water through the forest ecosystem from rainfall to the stream.
24715354|This study evaluated the effects of tree species and sites on soil carbohydrates, litterfall, and litter chemistry in 2-, 4- and 10-year-old improved fallows at three sites in eastern Zambia. Between April 2002 and August 2003, litter was collected in 2-year-old tree fallows at Kalichero, Kalunga and Msekera for chemical analyses. Soil samples collected at 030 cm from all experiments were analysed for total soil organic carbon (SOC), but only those from 4- and 10-year-old fallows were analysed for carbohydrates. Soil arabinose- and mannose-C stocks, and carbohydrate-C percentages of SOC (7.720.6 %) significantly (P < 0.05) differed across tree species in 10-year-old coppicing fallows at Msekera. Converting M + F to improved fallows resulted in a decline in monosaccharide-C, carbohydrate-C stocks and carbohydrate-C percentage of SOC. There were significant (P < 0.05) variations in litterfall (0.72.3 t ha year) and litter C contents (0.31.1 t ha year) across 2-year-old coppicing tree fallows at Msekera. Litter production and C contents were significantly greater on sandy soils at Kalunga than on fine-textured soils at Msekera. Litter chemical contents (C, N, AUR and polyphenols) and ratios (C:N, P:N, AUR:N, and (AUR + P):N) for litter in fallows differed significantly (P < 0.05) across species and sites. In this study, the role of litter in carbon cycling in improved fallows depended on tree species and site conditions.
1469325| An overview of a comprehensive study of the behavior and fate of mercury in the estuarine Patuxent River is presented. Total Hg (Hg<sub>T</sub>) and methylmercury (MeHg) exhibited weakly non-conservative behavior in the estuary. Total Hg concentrations ranged from 6 ng L<sup>-1</sup> in the upper reaches of the sub-urbanized tidal freshwater river to <latex>$<0.5\ \text{ng L}^{-1}$</latex> in the mesohaline lower estuary. Filterable (0.2 m) Hg<sub>T</sub> ranged from 0.2 to 1.5 ng L<sup>-1</sup>. On average, MeHg accounted for <5% of unfiltered Hg<sub>T</sub> and <2% of filterable Hg<sub>T</sub>. Dissolved gaseous Hg (DGHg) concentrations were highest (up to 150 pg L<sup>-1</sup>) in the summer in the mesohaline section, but were not well correlated with primary production or chlorophyll a, demonstrating the complex nature of Hg<sup>0</sup> formation and cycling in an estuarine environment. Organic matter content appeared to control the Hg<sub>T</sub> content of sediments, while MeHg in sediments was positively correlated with Hg<sub>T</sub> and organic matter, and negatively correlated with sulfide. MeHg in sediments was low (0.1 to 0.5% of Hg<sub>T</sub>). Preliminary findings suggest that net MeHg production within sediments exceeds net accumulation. Although Hg<sub>T</sub> in pore waters increased with increasing sulfide, bulk MeHg concentrations decreased. The concentration of MeHg in sediments was not related to the concentration of Hg<sub>T</sub> in pore waters. These observations support the hypothesis that sulfide affects the speciation and therefore bioavailability of dissolved and/or solid-phase Hg for methylation. Comparison with other ecosystems, and the negative correlation between pore water sulfide and sediment MeHg, suggest that sulfide limits production and accumulation of MeHg in this system. 
41410595|Despite long-term enhanced nitrogen (N) inputs, forests can retain considerable amounts of N. While rates of N inputs via throughfall and N leaching are increased in coniferous stands relative to deciduous stands at comparable sites, N leaching below coniferous stands is disproportionally enhanced relative to the N input. A better understanding of factors affecting N retention is needed to assess the impact of changing N deposition on N cycling and N loss of forests. Therefore, gross N transformation pathways were quantified in undisturbed well-drained sandy soils of adjacent equal-aged deciduous (pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.)) and coniferous (Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)) planted forest stands located in a region with high N deposition (north Belgium). In situ inorganic N labelling of the mineral topsoil (0-10 cm) combined with numerical data analysis demonstrated that (i) all gross N transformations differed significantly (p < 0.05) between the two forest soils, (ii) gross N mineralization in the pine soil was less than half the rate in the oak soil, (iii) meaningful N immobilization was only observed for ammonium, (iv) nitrate production via oxidation of organic N occurred three times faster in the pine soil while ammonium oxidation was similar in both soils, and (v) dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium was detected in both soils but was higher in the oak soil. We conclude that the higher gross nitrification (including oxidation of organic N) in the pine soil compared to the oak soil, combined with negligible nitrate immobilization, is in line with the observed higher nitrate leaching under the pine forest.
20519803|During 1999-2001 the chemical composition and fluxes were measured in rainfall, throughfall, soil solution and stream water in a remote forested site in the Italian Alps. The analysis of temporal patterns revealed the differential behaviour of nitrogen and sulphur and suggested that different mechanisms controlled their flux. No important changes in sulphate concentration and fluxes emerged as the solution passed through the various components of the forest ecosystem, and temporal variations of SO in the soil solution and stream were likely driven by the physical process of dilution. The availability of nitrate and ammonia, by contrast, was drastically reduced as throughfall water entered the soil and passed through the mineral layers, irrespective of season. The calculated hydrochemical budget based on throughfall and soil solution N fluxes revealed that 80% N retention in the forest soil, corresponding to 12 kg ha yr, despite a relatively high N deposition loading (15 kg ha yr). Most of the leached nitrogen (90%) was in the organic form. Indicators of the N status of this ecosystem, such as C/N ratio in solid and solution phase of the soil and N foliage content as well as land use history were examined. Despite the strong N retention in the forested part of the catchment, the stream water N-NO levels were consistently above 10 g l suggesting that the Val Masino catchment as a whole was less efficient in processing atmospheric N inputs. This contrasting N behaviour illustrates the role of landscape features, such as the soil cover and vegetation type, that is characteristic of an alpine catchment.
25652629|Uptake of nitrogen (N) via root-mycorrhizal associations accounts for a significant portion of total N supply to many vascular plants. Using stable isotope ratios (N) and the mass balance among N pools of plants, fungal tissues, and soils, a number of efforts have been made in recent years to quantify the flux of N from mycorrhizal fungi to host plants. Current estimates of this flux for arctic tundra ecosystems rely on the untested assumption that the N of labile organic N taken up by the fungi is approximately the same as the N of bulk soil. We report here hydrolysable amino acids are more depleted in N relative to hydrolysable ammonium and amino sugars in arctic tundra soils near Toolik Lake, Alaska, USA. We demonstrate, using a case study, that recognizing the depletion in N for hydrolysable amino acids (N = -5.6 on average) would alter recent estimates of N flux between mycorrhizal fungi and host plants in an arctic tundra ecosystem.
1469046| We determined the effects of nutrient amendments on plant growth in three tropical montane rainforest sites representing a sequence of soil ages (<30, 200, and  2000 y). Factorial fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus, and all other essential nutrients (combined) was applied to the two younger sites; only nitrogen was applied to the oldest one. Nitrogen supply represented the most important limitation to plant growth in the two younger sites; additions of nitrogen caused significant increases in tree diameter increment, height growth, litterfall, and most other growth-related parameters. In contrast, nitrogen additions had no significant effect on plant growth in the oldest site. Phosphorus additions increased extractable soil phosphorus and plant tissue phosphorus, but did not increase plant growth at the young sites. The results are consistent with Walker & Syers' (1976) model for the control of nutrient limitation during soil development. 
24715198|The influence of biogeochemical processes on nitrogen and organic matter transformation and transport was investigated for two urban streams receiving groundwater discharge during the dry summer baseflow period. A multiple lines of evidence approach involving catchment-, and stream reach-scale investigations were undertaken to describe the factors that influence pore water biogeochemical processes. At the catchment-scale gaining stream reaches were identified from water table mapping and groundwater discharge estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.8 m m d from baseflow analysis. Sediment temperature profiles also suggested that the high groundwater discharge limited stream water infiltration into the sediments. At the stream reach-scale, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations were higher in stream water than in groundwater. However, DOC and DON concentrations were greatest in sediment pore water. This suggests that biodegradation of sediment organic matter contributes dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the streams along with that delivered with groundwater flow. Pore water ammonium (NH) was closely associated with areas of high pore water DOM concentrations and evidence of sulfate (SO) reduction (low concentration and SO:Cl ratio). This indicates that anoxic DOM mineralization was occurring associated with SO reduction. However the distribution of anoxic mineralization was limited to the center of the streambed, and was not constrained by the distribution of sediment organic matter which was higher along the banks. Lower sediment temperatures measured along the banks compared to the center suggests, at least qualitatively, that groundwater discharge is higher along the banks. Based on this evidence anoxic mineralization is influenced by groundwater residence time, and is only measurable along the center of the stream where groundwater flux rates are lower. This study therefore shows that the distribution of biogeochemical processes in stream sediments, such as anoxic mineralization, is strongly influenced by both the biogeochemical conditions and pore water residence time.
20055248|The total solvent extracts (TSE) of mineral and organic horizons of selected soils and overlying vegetation were analyzed using gas chromatography--mass spectrometry (GC--MS) to determine the composition of solvent-extractable ('free') lipids in soils and to study the degradation and possible preservation of vascular plant-derived molecular markers (biomarkers) in soils. Major compound classes in the TSE of soils and vegetation included a homologous series of aliphatic lipids (alkanoic acids, alkanols, alkanes), steroids, and terpenoids. Characteristic patterns of aliphatic and cyclic biomarkers derived from the overlying, native vegetation were recognized in the associated soil samples indicating the preservation of lipids from the external waxes of vascular plants in the soil organic matter (SOM). The observed biomarker patterns in the grassland soils (Brown Chernozems) were similar to the compounds identified in their major source vegetation, Western Wheatgrass. A similar composition of biomarkers was observed in Aspen leaves and the soil horizons of the forest--grassland transition soil (Dark Gray Chernozem). The Lodgepole Pine needles yielded a characteristic pattern of diterpenoidsd that was also detected in leaf litter and the O horizon of the associated forest soil (Brunisol). The results demonstrate that solvent extractable biomarkers derived from vascular plants maintain their characteristic pattern of aliphatic and cyclic lipids despite ongoing degradation processes and are thus valuable molecular markers for the determination of the sources of SOM. Furthermore, the abundance of aliphatic wax lipids in plant material and soils decreased at higher rates than the steroids and terpenoids indicating the preferential degradation of aliphatic over cyclic biomarkers. Most of the plant-derived steroids and terpenoids identified in the soils were unaltered, preserved biomolecules as observed in the source vegetation, but minor amounts of their degradation products were also present. Oxidation products of plant sterols are reported here for the first time in soils. The detected alteration products of steroids and diterpenoids are consistent with the oxidative degradation of free cyclic biomarkers in decomposing plant material and soils.
1469473|We measured DOM fluxes from the O horizon of Hawaiian soils that varied in nutrient availability and mineral content to examine what regulates the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) from the surface layer of tropical soils. We examined DOM fluxes in a laboratory study from N, P and N+P fertilized and unfertilized sites on soils that ranged in age from 300 to 4 million years old. The fluxes of DOC and DON were generally related to the% C and% N content of the soils across the sites. In general, CO<sub>2</sub> and DOC fluxes were not correlated suggesting that physical desorption, dissolution and sorption reactions primarily control DOM release from these surface horizons. The one exception to this pattern was at the oldest site where there was a significant relationship between DOC and CO<sub>2</sub> flux. The oldest site also contained the lowest mineral and allophane content of the three sites and the DOC-respiration correlation indicates a relationship between microbial activity and DOC flux at this site. N Fertilization increased DON fluxes by 50% and decreased DOC:DON ratios in the youngest, most N poor site. In the older, more N rich sites, N fertilization neither increased DON fluxes nor decreased DOM C:N ratios. Similarly, short term changes in N availability in laboratory-based soil N and P fertilization experiments did not affect the DOM C:N ratios of leachate. DOM C:N ratios were similar to soil organic matter C:N ratios, and changes in DOM C:N ratios with fertilization appeared to have been mediated through long term effects on SOM C:N ratios rather than through changes in microbial demand for C and N. There was no relationship between DON and inorganic N flux during these incubations suggesting that the organic and inorganic components of N flux from soils are regulated by different factors and that DON fluxes are not coupled to immediate microbial demand for N. In contrast to the behavior of DON, the net flux of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and DOM C:P ratios responded to both long-term P fertilization and natural variation in reactive P availability. There was lower DOP flux and higher DOM C:P ratios from soils characterized by low P availability and high DOP flux and narrow DOM C:P ratios in sites with high P availability. DOP fluxes were also closely correlated with dissolved inorganic P fluxes. P Fertilization increased DOP fluxes by 73% in the youngest site, 31% in the P rich intermediate age site and 444% in the old, P poor site indicating that DOP fluxes closely track P availability in soils.
20456455|Termites and soil calcium carbonate are major factors in the global carbon cycle: termites by their role in decomposition of organic matter and methane production, and soil calcium carbonate by its storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide. In arid and semiarid soils, these two factors potentially come together by means of biomineralization of calcium carbonate by termites. In this study, we evaluated this possibility by testing two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 states that termites biomineralize calcium carbonate internally and use it as a cementing agent for building aboveground galleries. Hypothesis 2 states that termites transport calcium carbonate particles from subsoil horizons to aboveground termite galleries where the carbonate detritus becomes part of the gallery construction. These hypotheses were tested by using (1) field documentation that determined if carbonate-containing galleries only occurred on soils containing calcic horizons, (2) C/C ratios, (3) X-ray diffraction, (4) petrographic thin sections, (5) scanning electron microscopy, and (6) X-ray mapping. Four study sites were evaluated: a C-grassland site with no calcic horizons in the underlying soil, a C-grassland site with calcic horizons, a C-shrubland site with no calcic horizons, and a C-shrubland site with calcic horizons. The results revealed that carbonate is not ubiquitously present in termite galleries. It only occurs in galleries if subsoil carbonate exists within a depth of 100 cm. C/C ratios of carbonate in termite galleries typically matched C/C ratios of subsoil carbonate. X-ray diffraction revealed that the carbonate mineralogy is calcite in all galleries, in all soils, and in the termites themselves. Thin sections, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray mapping revealed that carbonate exists in the termite gut along with other soil particles and plant opal. Each test argued against the biomineralization hypothesis and for the upward-transport hypothesis. We conclude, therefore, that the gallery carbonate originated from upward transport and that this CaCO plays a less active role in short-term carbon sequestration than it would have otherwise played if it had been biomineralized directly by the termites.
40800591|Many ecologists and biogeochemists explore the interaction of the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles by addressing N: P ratios. While N: P ratios are recognized as broadly important to the composition and functioning of lotie ecosystems, the fundamental controls on stream water N: P ratio variation remains poorly understood. Low N: P ratio (less than 16) streams appear more likely in arid climates than in mesic climates, suggesting possible hydrologie or landscape controls. We explored the importance of watershed hydrology to the variation of total  to total P (TN: TP) ratios in stream water, and whether such variation is characteristically different across watershed classes based on mean annual precipitation and median observed TN: TP ratio. Nonparametric scatter plot analysis was applied to normalized TN: TP ratios and associated discharge (Q) measurements from 57 minimally-impacted watersheds from the contiguous United States. At the seasonal scale, TN: TP ratios showed a negative relationship with Q in semiarid climates and a positive relationship with Q in humid climates. Over storm event scales, TN: TP ratios decline with increasing Q across all watershed classes. The results broadly indicate hydrology is an important driver of TN: TP ratio variation over multiple time scales. We hypothesize that the broad differences across watershed classes are driven by variation in the nature of connectivity (frequency and magnitude of connections) of the landscape to streams. A strong physical control of N: P ratios in stream water is in stark contrast to the biological control of N: P ratios in the oceans, suggesting that application of stoichiometric theory developed using marine systems to lotie systems requires a broader consideration of controlling factors.
40343615|The effect of land use on the biogeochemistry of small tropical rivers and their estuaries was studied using the Kallada River and Ashtamudi estuary located in the State of Kerala, India, as a model system. Water, suspended matter and sediments collected during the monsoon and intermonsoon periods in 2002 and 2003 were analyzed for dissolved nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate) and for phytoplankton abundance and composition, amino acid contents and stable carbon (C)) and nitrogen (N) isotope ratios. Seasonal and spatial variations of dissolved nutrients and suspended matter along the course of the river point to distinct differences in the C and N sources that are controlled by hydrology, geology and land use. Unusually low concentrations of dissolved silicate and suspended matter suggest low erosion rates of the Precambrian basement rocks and the firm lateritic soils in non-agricultural areas. Most dissolved nutrients and suspended particulate organic matter originated from fertilized agricultural soils. The biogeochemistry of sedimentary organic matter indicates that most of the Kallada River load is deposited in the upper Ashtamudi estuary, while the middle and lower parts have a stronger marine influence. The spatio-temporal variation of dissolved and particulate river fluxes clearly indicates an effect of land use and land cover on the biogeochemistry of the Kallada River. While the phosphate yield was high (6 x 10 mol km year or 185 kg km year), the N yield was relatively low (10 x 10 mol km year or 141 kg km year), which is unlike the situation in many other densely populated regions of tropical Asia.
20456449|Fire profoundly modifies the terrestrial C cycle of about 40% of the Earth's land surface. The immediate effect of fire is that of a net loss of C as CO gas and soot particles to the atmosphere. Nevertheless, a proportion of the ecosystem biomass is converted into charcoal, which contains highly recalcitrant molecular structures that contribute to long-term C storage. The present study aimed to assess simultaneously losses to the atmosphere and charcoal production rates of C and N compounds as a result of prescription fire in a Florida scrub-oak ecosystem. Pre-fire and post-fire charred and unburned organic matter stocks were determined for vegetation leaves and stems, litter and soil in 20 sub-plots installed in a 30-ha area that was subjected to prescribed fire. Concentrations of C and N were determined, and fluxes among pools and to the atmosphere were derived from these measurements. Soil C and N stocks were unchanged by the fire. Post-fire standing dead biomass contained 30% and 12% of pre-fire vegetation C and N stocks, respectively. In litter, post-fire stocks contained 64% and 83% of pre-fire C and N stocks, respectively. Most of the difference in relative losses between vegetation and litter could be attributed to substantial litter fall of charred and unburned leaves during the fire event. Indeed, an estimated 21% of pre-fire vegetation leaf C was found in the post-fire litter, while the remaining 79% was lost to the atmosphere. About 3/4 of the fire-induced leaf litter fall was in the form of unburned tissue and the remainder was charcoal, which amounted to 5% of pre-fire leaf C stocks. Charcoal production ranged between 4% and 6% of the fire-affected biomass, i.e. the sum of charcoal production and atmospheric losses. This value is below the range of literature values for the transformation of plant tissue into stable soil organic matter through humification processes, which suggests that fire generates a smaller quantity of stable organic C than humification processes over decades and potentially centuries.
1468752|Concentrations of the principal inorganic and organic solutes in the soil root-zone were measured in six contrasting lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) forest ecosystems for five years (1979-1983). Consistent temporal changes in the principal inorganic solutes (Ca, Mg, K, Na, SO<sub>4</sub>, Cl) were observed in all the forest stands and years of study: high concentrations at the initiation of snowmelt in the spring were followed by rapid declines to rather constant values in the mid to late stages of snowmelt. Except for K, concentrations of these solutes differed significantly between sites and between years. Sulfate was the principal mobile anion in the root-zone soil solutions, but contributions of bicarbonate and organic anions also were important. The pH of root-zone solutions was relatively high (6.0), did not change significantly as snowmelt proceeded, and was significantly lower in high-clay soils. No consistent trends in bicarbonate alkalinity were observed and soil atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were only about 10 to 20 times above atmospheric levels, peaking at the end of the snowmelt interval. Concurrent changes in the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, non-volatile acid-neutralizing capacity, and total Al and Fe indicated that these soil-forming metals were transported vertically in the soil as organic complexes. Precipitation of these complexes was more rapid and more complete in the soils with high clay content than in the coarser soils. Moreover, organic anions comprised up to 30% of the total anionic charge in the coarse-textured soils but less than 10% in the fine soils. Little seasonal or spatial variation of inorganic N and P concentrations was observed in root-zone solutions, probably as a result of high biotic demand for these limiting nutrients. Flux of N and P in these ecosystems was predominately via organic forms so that losses of these nutrients was strongly linked to the mobility of dissolved organic carbon. However, a two-fold increase in the organic N:P and C:P ratios was observed during passage of melt water from the forest floor to mineral soil, evidence of more rapid mineralization of organic P.
23359760|In Northern Alaska (AK), large variation in biogeochemical cycling exists among landscapes underlain by different aged geologic substrates deposited throughout the Pleistocene. Younger, less weathered landscapes have higher pH (6.5 vs. 4.5), ten-fold higher exchangeable cation concentrations, and slower rates of microbial activity than older, more weathered landscapes. To tease apart the effects of polyvalent cations vs. pH on microbial activity and organic matter solubility and stabilization, we conducted a soil incubation experiment. We collected soils near Toolik Lake, Alaska from replicated sites along a chronosequence of landscape ages ranging from 11,000 to 4.8 million years since glaciation and manipulated soil pH and calcium (Ca, the dominant polyvalent cation across all landscape ages) using a factorial experimental design. As expected, microbial respiration was inhibited by high Ca concentrations at both pH 6.5 and 4.5. In contrast, soils with circumneutral pH (but similar Ca concentrations) exhibited higher rates of microbial respiration than soils with acidic pH, opposite of in situ patterns. Manipulated soils with acidic (4.5) pH (but similar Ca concentrations) exhibited higher cumulative dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in leachates than soils with circumneutral (6.5) pH, similar to in situ patterns of leaching among landscape ages, but there was no consistent effect of pH on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in leachates across landscape ages. Increasing Ca concentration inhibited cumulative DOC in leachates at circumneutral pH as expected, but had no effect on DOC or DON in leachates at acidic pH. Our results indicate that both polyvalent cation concentration and pH likely influence microbial activity in tundra soils, suggesting that heterogeneity in geochemical factors associated with landscape age should be considered in models of tundra biogeochemistry.
4151474|The usual method of restoring cut-over bogs is to rewet the peat surface, but this often leads to the remaining peat layers being deeply inundated. For Sphagnum-dominated vegetation to develop at deeply inundated locations, it is important for floating rafts of buoyant residual peat to develop. In this study, the chemical and physical characteristics of buoyant and inundated peat collected from rewetted cut-over bog were compared. In general, buoyant peat was poorly humified; high methane (CH4) production rates (
1468814|The River Seine, below Paris, receives the effluents from a large sewage treatment plant, increasing the ammonium concentration up to 6 mgN.l<sup>-</sup> in late summer. Careful measurement of ammonium, nitrate and organic nitrogen during the downriver travel of the water masses over 100 km below the outfall, along with direct determination of nitrification and benthic fluxes, allowed to establish a budget of nitrogen transport and transformations in this reach of the river. Nitrification is shown to start after a distinct period of several days required for the growth of a significant nitrifying bacterial population. Denitrification is active in the upper layer of bottom sediments but absent from the water column. Comparison of our data with those published for the period 1973-1976 shows that the nitrate load carried by the river has increased not only because of higher runoff of agricultural nitrate in the upstream part of the watershed, but also as a result of the severe reduction in the rate of denitrification processes, owing to the restoration of better oxygen conditions.
20519865|The main objective of this study was to assess organic matter (OM) and methylmercury (MeHg) sources for freshwater littoral macroinvertebrate primary consumers. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (C, N) of sources (epiphytes, macrophytes, suspended particulate matter _SPM) and of macroinvertebrate consumers were measured in a fluvial lake with extensive macrophyte beds (emergent and submerged). To determine the relative contribution of each OM source to macroinvertebrate diets we used the IsoSource model that examines all possible combinations of solutions for each source. Total and MeHg concentrations of consumers were also measured. Results show that epiphytes and macrophytes are dominant in the diet of macroinvertebrates, especially in early summer (July). In mid-summer (August), SPM constitutes a non-negligible OM source to the primary consumers. Hg concentrations were higher in epiphytes than in the other OM sources. The proportion of epiphytes in macroinvertebrate diet was positively correlated with the percentage of MeHg in their tissues. There was no relationship between SPM assimilation and Hg concentration in macroinvertebrate consumers. These results suggest that epiphytes and macrophytes constitute the main pathway of Hg bioaccumulation in littoral food webs.
1468940|Mass and nitrogen (N) dynamics of leaf litter measured in Alaskan tussock tundra differed greatly from measurements of these processes made in temperate ecosystems. Nearly all litter mass and N loss occurred during the winter when soils were mostly frozen. Litter lost mass during the first summer, but during the subsequent two summers when biological activity was presumably higher than it is during winter, litter mass remained constant and litter immobilized N. By contrast, litter lost significant mass and N over both winters of measurement. Mass loss and N dynamics were unaffected by microsite variation in soil temperature and moisture. Whether wintertime mass and N loss resulted from biological activity during winter or from physical processes (e.g., fragmentation or leaching) associated with freeze-thaw is unknown, but has implications for how future climate warming will alter carbon (C) and N cycling in tundra. We hypothesize that spring runoff over permafrost as soils melt results in significant losses of C and N from litter, consistent with the observed influx of terrestrial organic matter to tundra lakes and streams after snow melt and the strong N limitation of terrestrial primary production.
41490515|The OSPAR Eutrophication Strategy requires assessment of eutrophication to be based on the ecological consequences of nutrient enrichment and not just on nutrient enrichment alone, i.e. finding reliable evidence for accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life caused by anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, leading to undesirable disturbance. Fully flushed marine waters of England and Wales (salinity > 30) were assessed against OSPAR's harmonised criteria of nutrient concentration and ratios, chlorophyll concentrations, phytoplankton indicator species, macrophytes, dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, incidence of fish kills and changes in the zoobenthos, using region specific thresholds. None of the thirteen assessment areas, including six nutrient enriched areas, exhibited evidence for undesirable disturbance. This paper details the methods and the overall outcome of the assessment. It presents evidence that undesirable disturbance caused by nutrient enrichment was not detected in English and Welsh marine waters assessed under the OSPAR procedure. The main reasons for the lack of eutrophication problems, such as the underwater light climate limiting the accelerated growth of algae, which might otherwise result from nutrient enrichment, are discussed.
41410608|Organic phosphorus (P) is an important component of boreal forest humus soils, and its concentration has been found to be closely related to the concentration of iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al). We used solution and solid state P NMR spectroscopy on humus soils to characterize organic P along two groundwater recharge and discharge gradients in Fennoscandian boreal forest, which are also P sorption gradients due to differences in aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe) concentration in the humus. The composition of organic P changed sharply along the gradients. Phosphate diesters and their degradation products, as well as polyphosphates, were proportionally more abundant in low Al and Fe sites, whereas phosphate monoesters such as myo-, scyllo- and unknown inositol phosphates dominated in high Al and Fe soils. The concentration of inositol phosphates, but not that of diesters, was positively related to Al and Fe concentration in the humus soil. Overall, in high Al and Fe sites the composition of organic P seemed to be closely associated with stabilization processes, whereas in low Al and Fe sites it more closely reflected inputs of organic P, given the dominance of diesters which are generally assumed to constitute the bulk of organic P inputs to the soil. These gradients encompass the broad variation in soil properties detected in the wider Fennoscandian boreal forest landscape, as such our findings provide insight into the factors controlling P biogeochemistry in the region but should be of relevance to boreal forests elsewhere.
23359752|Soil nitrogen (N) is an important component in maintaining ecosystem stability, and the introduction of non-native plants can alter N cycling by changing litter quality and quantity, nutrient uptake patterns, and soil food webs. Our goal was to determine the effects of Bromus tectorum (C 3 ) invasion on soil microbial N cycling in adjacent non-invaded and invaded C 3 and C 4 native arid grasslands. We monitored resin-extractable N, plant and soil  13 C and  15 N, gross rates of inorganic N mineralization and consumption, and the quantity and isotopic composition of microbial phospholipid biomarkers. In invaded C 3 communities, labile soil organic N and gross and net rates of soil N transformations increased, indicating an increase in overall microbial N cycling. In invaded C 4 communities labile soil N stayed constant, but gross N flux rates increased. The  13 C of phospholipid biomarkers in invaded C 4 communities showed that some portion of the soil bacterial population preferentially decomposed invader C 3 -derived litter over that from the native C 4 species. Invasion in C 4 grasslands also significantly decreased the proportion of fungal to bacterial phospholipid biomarkers. Different processes are occurring in response to B. tectorum invasion in each of these two native grasslands that: 1) alter the size of soil N pools, and/or 2) the activity of the microbial community. Both processes provide mechanisms for altering long-term N dynamics in these ecosystems and highlight how multiple mechanisms can lead to similar effects on ecosystem function, which may be important for the construction of future biogeochemical process models.
24715138|The degree to which microbial communities adjust their decomposition of soil carbon over time in response to long-term increases in temperature is one of the key uncertainties in our modeling of the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to warming. To better understand changes in temperature sensitivity of soil microbial communities to long-term increases in soil temperature, we incubated 27 soils for one year with both short-term and long-term manipulations of temperature. In response to increasing temperature short-term from 20 to 30 C, respiration rates increased more than threefold on average across soils. Yet, in response to long-term increases in temperature, respiration rates increased approximately half as much as they did to short-term increases in temperature. Short-term Q of recalcitrant C correlated positively with long-term Q measured between 10 and 20 C, yet there was no relationship between short-term Q and long-term Q between 20 and 30 C. In all, under laboratory conditions, it is clear that there is reduction in the temperature sensitivity of decomposition to long-term increases in temperature that disassociate short- and long-term responses of microbial decomposition to temperature. Determining the fate of soil organic matter to increased temperature will not only require further research on the controls and mechanisms of these patterns, but also require models to incorporate responses to both short-term and long-term increases in temperature.
41490516|There are several approaches for assessing nutrient enrichment impacts in marine waters including the OSPAR* Comprehensive Procedure, the TRIX* ranking process, the WFD, ASSETS* and EPA NCA*. They differ in definitions and application, but all use key indicators for evaluating eutrophication status. Data from two estuaries in the United Kingdom (UK) were used to test the hypothesis that these five methods would result in the same outcome. The intent is to provide managers with information for selecting an appropriate method, insight about how each method works, how results from different methods compare and a basis for improvement of methods. Results from all approaches indicate that both estuaries required management intervention, but detailed results differed. Methods using more than one biological indicator show that secondary biological impacts were minimal, with the exception of moderate macroalgal problems in the Medway. Comparison of final results was difficult due to differences in: timeframes of data analysis (seasonal versus annual), characteristics included in indicator metrics (concentration, spatial coverage, frequency of occurrence), and methods for combining indicators to determine eutrophication status. This comparison suggests that use of annual data, inclusion frequency of occurrence, spatial coverage and, secondary biological indicators in the index, and a multi-category rating scale results in a more representative assessment.
1469826| To determine if changes in microbial community composition and metabolic capacity alter decomposition patterns of young and old soil carbon pools, we incubated soils under conditions of varying temperature, N-availability, and water content. We used a soil from a pineapple plantation (CAM;  <sup>13</sup>C litter = -14.1) that had previously been under tropical forest (C3;  <sup>13</sup>C soil carbon = -26.5). Forest derived carbon represented 'old' carbon and plantation inputs represented 'new' carbon. In order to differentiate utilization of young (< 14 years) and old (> 14 years) soil carbon, we measured the  <sup>13</sup>C of respired CO<sub>2</sub> and microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) during a 103 day laboratory incubation. We determined community composition (PLFA and bacterial intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) analysis) in addition to carbon degrading and nutrient releasing enzyme activities. We observed that greater quantities of older carbon were respired at higher temperatures (20 and 35 C) compared to the lower temperature (5 C). This effect could be explained by changes in microbial community composition and accompanying changes in enzyme activities that affect C degradation. Nitrogen addition stimulated the utilization of older soil carbon, possibly due to greater peroxidase activity, but microbial community composition was unaffected by this treatment. Increasing soil moisture had no effect on the utilization of older SOM, but enzyme activity typically declined. Increased oxidative enzyme activities in response to elevated temperature and nitrogen additions point to a plausible mechanism for alterations in C resource utilization patterns. 
1469795|We measured CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from rice paddies managed by farmer's practices in Changsha, Hunan Province, China, from 1995 to 1997. During the winter season, rice fields were left fallow under either drained (C-Fallow) or flooded conditions (C-Flood), and planted with either Chinese milk vetch (C-GM) or oil-seed rape (C-Rape). The organic manure produced in the winter (weeds, Chinese milk vetch, or oil-seed rape straw) was incorporated in situ before the early-rice transplanting. Both early-rice and late-rice straws were removed and the soil was not amended with any exogenous organic manure. For 1996 to 1997, the average seasonal CH<sub>4</sub> emission for the double rice cropping period was the highest from the plot that was flooded in the winter (103.5 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>) and lowest from the plot planted and incorporated with Chinese milk vetch (32.6 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>). Precipitation in the winter not only affected growth of green manure, which was incorporated in situ, but might also affect CH<sub>4</sub> emissions during the subsequent rice growing period. Therefore, a simple relationship could not be found between the incorporated amount of green manure and CH<sub>4</sub> emission. In the plots incorporated with vetch and oil-seed rape straw CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were significantly less during the subsequent late-rice period than during the early-rice period. This phenomenon might be attributed to a 'priming effect' of green manure, which exhausted soil labile organic matter. Based on the CH<sub>4</sub> flux measurements, the total CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from rice fields in Hunan Province during the rice growing season were estimated as 1.56 Tg CH<sub>4</sub> in 1996 and 1.06 Tg CH<sub>4</sub> in 1997. Large variation of precipitation in the winter would be an important factor controlling the annual variation of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from the treatments.
20055312|Nitrous oxide (NO) is a potent greenhouse gas with a high contribution from agricultural soils and emissions that depend on soil type, climate, crops and management practices. The NO emissions therefore need to be included as an integral part of environmental assessments of agricultural production systems. An algorithm for NO production and emission from agricultural soils was developed and included in the FASSET whole-farm model. The model simulated carbon and nitrogen (N) turnover on a daily basis. Both nitrification and denitrification was included in the model as sources for NO production, and the NO emissions depended on soil microbial and physical conditions. The model was tested on experimental data of NO emissions from grasslands in UK, Finland and Denmark, differing in climatic conditions, soil properties and management. The model simulated the general time course of NO emissions and captured the observed effects of fertiliser and manure management on emissions. Scenario analyses for grazed and cut grasslands were conducted to evaluate the effects of soil texture, climatic conditions, grassland management and N fertilisation on NO emissions. The soils varied from coarse sand to sandy loam and the climatic variation was taken to represent the climatic variation within Denmark. N fertiliser rates were varied from 0 to 500 kg N
1469967|Mechanisms underlying catchment export of nitrogen (N) during seasonal transitions (i.e., winter to spring and summer to autumn) were investigated in high-elevation catchments of the Sierra Nevada using stable isotopes of nitrate and water, intensive monitoring of stream chemistry and detailed catchment N-budgets. We had four objectives: (1) determine the relative contribution of snowpack and soil nitrate to the spring nitrate pulse, (2) look for evidence of biotic control of N losses at the catchment scale, (3) examine dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) export patterns to gain a better understanding of the biological and hydrological controls on DON loss, and (4) examine the relationship between soil physico-chemical conditions and N export. At the Emerald Lake watershed, nitrogen budgets and isotopic analyses of the spring nitrate pulse indicate that 50 to 70% of the total nitrate exported during snowmelt (ca. April to July) is derived from catchment soils and talus; the remainder is snowpack nitrate. The spring nitrate pulse occurred several weeks after the start of snowmelt and was different from export patterns of less biologically labile compounds such as silica and DON suggesting that: (1) nitrate is produced and released from soils only after intense flushing has occurred and (2) a microbial N-sink is operating in catchment soils during the early stages of snowmelt. DON concentrations varied less than 20-30% during snowmelt, indicating that soil processes tightly controlled DON losses.
24716799|Silicon (Si) is a key element in global biogeochemical cycling and recent research has shown that changes in the biological component of the Si cycle may lead to more rapid variations in the landocean Si transfer than previously thought. The objective of this paper is to better understand the controls on temporal Si dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, by studying Si fluxes from a small forested catchment in central Belgium. An intensive monitoring program (20082010) of dissolved and amorphous silica (DSi and ASi) concentrations and load patterns show that DSi concentrations are significantly lower during winterspring periods than during summerautumn periods. In contrast to what was found in other studies, seasonal dynamics in Meerdaal forest are not controlled by variations in biological uptake or temperature, but mainly by the more important supply of pore-water to the groundwater table in winterspring periods. Analysis of seasonal and event fluctuations in stream water DSi concentrations showed that final stream water is a mixture of old, DSi rich water pushed out of the soil, and new, DSi poor water delivered by quick flow. The mixing of old and new water finally resulted in streamwater DSi concentrations responding only moderately to variations in discharge (near-chemostatic behaviour). We estimated the total DSi export from the system to be ca. 65.1  10 mol km year. Because Si delivery is biologically regulated through an important Si cycle in the vegetation-soil continuum, an anthropogenic (e.g. agricultural expansion) or climatic disturbance of terrestrial ecosystems may alter both water residence times through shifts in hydrological regimes and the DSi chemical equilibrium concentration in soils. In turn, these perturbations will potentially alter long-term DSi and ASi inputs to aquatic systems.
24715346|Road salt deicers, especially NaCl and CaCl, are increasingly applied to paved areas throughout the world. The goal of this study is to investigate the influence of high concentrations of these salts on wetland biogeochemistry. Sediment cores were collected in fall and spring from a freshwater wetland fringing an urban kettle lake (Asylum Lake, Kalamazoo, MI, USA), and incubated for 100 days in deionized water (control) or with treatments of 1 or 5 g/L CaCl2HO or 5 g/L NaCl to simulate addition of road salt deciers. At monthly intervals, cores were sliced into three depths (05, 510, 1015 cm) and pore waters extracted for analysis of pH, total alkalinity and dissolved Mn(II), Fe(II), ${{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{O}}_{4}^{-3}}$, NH, HS, SO, Na, K, Mg, and Ca. Changes in solid phase geochemistry were assessed by measuring the percent organic matter and the distribution of Fe and Mn among four operationally defined sediment fractions (exchangeable, carbonate, reducible, oxidizable) in the control and treatment cores. Addition of NaCl, and especially CaCl, stimulated significant growth of microbial mats at the core sedimentwater interface and led to decreased pH and increased concentrations of Mn(II), Fe(II) and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) in the sediment pore waters. This study demonstrates that the influx of road salt deciers is likely to have a significant impact on biogeochemical cycling in wetland sediments.
1468858|Release of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil of a peatland (fen) in The Netherlands was measured by means of an in situ incubation technique. Three sampling stations were chosen along a gradient in the plant productivity and water chemistry of the fen. The station with the highest biomass production was located near the ditch that supplied the fen with water in amounts matching water losses through evaporation and downward percolation to the groundwater. Water chemistry at this station strongly resembled that of the ditch water. The two stations remote from the ditch had much lower plant biomass, and significantly lower pH, conductivity, and calcium and bicarbonate concentrations. The vegetation at these two stations was characterized by a thick Sphagnum carpet. The release of inorganic N and P was much faster at the two stations remote from the ditch than at that located near the ditch. The differences in mineralization rate are probably due to the differences in water chemistry; phosphates are more soluble at low than at high pH. The fast N mineralization at stations with a thick Sphagnum carpet may be related to the chemical composition of Sphagnum litter. The difference in productivity is not explained by the N and P mineralization rates. Direct supply of N and P from the ditch are probably the main cause of the high productivity at the station bordering the ditch.

40343613|Glacier surfaces are known to harbour abundant and active microbial communities. Phosphorus has been shown to be deficient in glacial environments, and thus is one of the limits on microbial growth and activity. We quantified the phosphorus pool in cryoconite debris and the concentration of dissolved phosphorus in supraglacial water on Werenskioldbreen, a Svalbard glacier. The mean total P content of the cryoconite debris was ~ 2.2 mg g , which is significantly more than would be expected in rock debris from local sources. 57% of this P was present in the fraction defined as organic P. It may account for the P in excess of the rock debris, and could be explained by allochthonous input of organic matter. The concentration of total dissolved P in supraglacial water was very low (5.2-8.5 g 1), which was probably caused by efficient flushing and re-adsorption onto mineral surfaces. Dissolved organic P (DOP) was a very important component of the dissolved phosphorus pool on Werenskioldbreen, as concentrations of DOP typically exceeded those of dissolved inorganic P (or SRP) by more than four times in all the glacial water types. It is very difficult to assess whether P was limiting in this environment solely on the basis of the N: P ratios in the debris or biomass. There may be some degree of biological control over the C: N: P ratios in the debris, but the phosphorus cycling in the supraglacial environment on this glacier seems to be mainly controlled by physical and geochemical processes.
41410588|Inland freshwaters transform and retain up to half of the carbon that enters from the terrestrial environment and have recently been recognized as important components of regional and global carbon budgets. However, the importance of small streams to these carbon budgets is not well understood due to the lack of globally-distributed data, especially from streams draining agricultural landscapes. We quantified organic carbon pools and heterotrophic metabolism seasonally in 6 low-order streams draining rowcrop fields in northwestern Indiana, USA, and used these data to examine patterns in organic carbon spiraling lengths (S OC ; km), downstream velocities (V OC ; m/d), and turnover rates (K OC ; day). There were seasonal differences in S OC , with the longest spiraling lengths in winter (range: 7.7-54.4 km) and the shortest in early and late summer (range: 0.2-9.0 km). This seasonal pattern in S OC was primarily driven by differences in discharge, suggesting that hydrology tightly controls the fate of organic carbon in these streams. K OC did not differ seasonally, and variability (range: 0.0007-0.0193 day) was controlled by differences in stream water soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations. Compared to previous studies conducted primarily in forested streams, agricultural streams tended to be less retentive of organic carbon. These systems function predominantly as conduits transporting organic carbon to downstream ecosystems, except during low, stable-flow periods (i.e., late summer) when agricultural streams can be as retentive of organic carbon as forested headwaters. High organic carbon retention in the late summer has implications for coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling (i.e., denitrification), which may play an important role in removing nitrate from stream water during periods of low flow.
41490526|Accurately predicting the effects of global change on net carbon (C) exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere requires a more complete understanding of how nutrient availability regulates both plant growth and heterotrophic soil respiration. Models of soil development suggest that the nature of nutrient limitation changes over the course of ecosystem development, transitioning from nitrogen (N) limitation in 'young' sites to phosphorus (P) limitation in 'old' sites. However, previous research has focused primarily on plant responses to added nutrients, and the applicability of nutrient limitation-soil development models to belowground processes has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we assessed the effects of nutrients on soil C cycling in three different forests that occupy a 4 million year substrate age chronosequence where tree growth is N limited at the youngest site, co-limited by N and P at the intermediate-aged site, and P limited at the oldest site. Our goal was to use short-term laboratory soil C manipulations (using C-labeled substrates) and longer-term intact soil core incubations to compare belowground responses to fertilization with above-ground patterns. When nutrients were applied with labile C (sucrose), patterns of microbial nutrient limitation were similar to plant patterns: microbial activity was limited more by N than by P in the young site, and P was more limiting than N in the old site. However, in the absence of C additions, increased respiration of native soil organic matter only occurred with simultaneous additions of N and P. Taken together, these data suggest that altered nutrient inputs into ecosystems could have dissimilar effects on C cycling above- and belowground, that nutrients may differentially affect of the fate of different soil C pools, and that future changes to the net C balance of terrestrial ecosystems will be partially regulated by soil nutrient status.
1469308|The upland boreal forest at the Experimental Lakes Area (northwestern Ontario, Canada) is characterized by treed soil islands interspersed within lichen and moss-covered bedrock outcrops. N mineralization was 2.5-fold and net nitrification was 13-fold higher on an areal basis over bedrock surfaces because of high mineralization rates under lichen and moss patches. The higher average soil temperature in lichen and moss patches could not account for the difference in mineralization rates. Lichens did not provide a significant additional source of N because they did not fix atmospheric N. A refractory conifer litter with a high C:N probably favours the immobilization of N in forest islands. Buried bag and in situ core incubations yielded similar net N mineralization rates but core incubations underestimated net nitrification rates. Both methods did not adequately measure dissolved organic N (DON) production rates because soil disturbance caused high initial DON concentrations. The higher export of mineral N from bedrock surfaces is probably a combination of the lower retention of N in precipitation and leaching of mineralized N from lichen and moss patches.
20456482|We report data of a naturally occurring radionuclide, Th, an in situ tracer, to investigate vertical export of biogenic matter during a vernal bloom of Phaeocystis pouchetii in the fjords of northern Norway. To optimise sampling of different stages of the bloom, three fjords with increasing oceanic influence (Balsfjord, Malangen fjord and Ullsfjord, respectively) were investigated in April 1997. Contrasting situations were encountered between the three fjords: the proliferation of P. pouchetii in Ullsfjord surface waters coincided with a drastic reduction of particulate Th fluxes in traps, although particulate organic carbon (POC) and dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) were exported and Th was available in surface waters. When large colonies make up a significant fraction of the vertical flux, as observed in Ullsfjord in April 1997, there may be a large and rapic change in the POC/Th ratio, further complicating the use of Th as a tracer for POC export. The results suggest that the proliferation of Phaeocystis pouchetii during vernal bloom could temporary increase OC/Th ratio of particles and delay the particulate export of Th, and probably of other particle-reactive species, from surface waters.
20456506|The need to understand how forest management practices affect soil CO exchange with the atmosphere (soil respiration) has increased with the recognition of a likely feedback effect of climate warming on soil respiration rates. Previous research addressing the mechanisms driving soil respiration has yielded inconsistent and/or conflicting results. This study looked to alternative above-ground forest characteristics to help explain spatial variability in soil respiration in a 30-year-old Sierra Nevada pine plantation. Fire hazard mitigation is one of the predominant management goals in these and other western US forests. Therefore, this analysis examined how fuels treatments, including shredding of understory vegetation (mastication), prescribed fire, and a combination thereof, affected soil respiration and its relationship to environmental factors and post-fire tree injuries. Multiple regression models indicated that mastication had no significant impact on soil respiration, but the roles of soil temperature and forest floor depth (O horizons) in the models increased after the treatment. Burning reduced soil respiration by 14%, and increased its sensitivity to tree proximity and the exposure of bare mineral soil. Scorch height in burned stands was negatively correlated with soil respiration. Models incorporating only tree injury or tree proximity parameters explained between 63% and 91% of the variability in burned plantations. This work suggests that measures of above-ground forest features can increase understanding of management impacts on soil respiration, and the mechanisms by which these impacts occur. These results are especially applicable in Mediterranean climates, where moisture stress reduces the effectiveness of soil microclimate in explaining soil respiration.
1469755| Powdered and pelletized wollastonite (CaSiO<sub>3</sub>) was applied to an 11.8 ha forested watershed at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in northern New Hampshire, U.S.A. during October of 1999. The dissolution of wollastonite was studied using watershed solute mass balances, and a <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr isotopic tracer. The wollastonite (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr = 0.70554) that was deposited directly into the stream channel began to dissolve immediately, resulting in marked increases in stream water Ca concentrations and decreases in the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios from pre-application values of 0.872 mg/L and 0.72032 to values of  2.6 mg/L and 0.71818 respectively. After one calendar year, 401 kg of the initial 631 kg of wollastonite applied to the stream channel was exported as stream dissolved load, and 230 kg remained within the stream channel as residual CaSiO<sub>3</sub> and/or adsorbed on streambed exchange sites. Using previously established values for streambed Ca exchange capacity at the HBEF, the dissolution rate for wollastonite was found to be consistent with dissolution rates measured in laboratory experiments. Initially, Ca was released from the mineral lattice faster than Si, resulting in the development of a Ca-depleted leached layer on mineral grains. The degree of preferential Ca release decreased with time and reached stoichiometric proportions after  6 months. Using Sr as a proxy for Ca, the Ca from wollastonite dissolution can be accurately tracked as it is transported through the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems of this watershed. 
41490552|By constructing nitrogen (N) budgets from 1880 to 2002 for watersheds that have undergone urbanization, intensive agricultural specialization or experienced minimal change, we document an uneven timeline of increase in anthropogenic N inputs. N loading to the watersheds of the Lake Michigan Basin grew six-fold from 1880 to 2002, peaking in 1987. Human activities influenced N inputs as early as 1880, and the magnitude and timing of increase differed markedly across regions in accord with population growth, land use, and type of agriculture. The greatest increase occurred from 1950 to 1980, corresponding with rapidly accelerating use of artificial fertilizers, but increases in atmospheric deposition and shifting patterns in crop and livestock production also affected trends. Net anthropogenic N inputs have changed little since about 1980, showing a modest decline due to a leveling out of fertilizer use and greater export of animal feed and products. Using a model that predicts riverine N export from watershed N loadings and river discharge, we found that river TN fluxes from all tributaries increased approximately threefold from 1900 to 2000 but have stabilized or declined over the past two decades, consistent with national surveys that show near-constant or declining riverine TN concentrations. For the LMB, the past two decades has been a period of relative stasis in N inputs to its terrestrial systems and N export from watersheds. This retrospective analysis also points to the challenge of forecasting future trends in N budget terms, which can both increase and decline in response to policy and societal transitions.
1468642| Production, turnover and nutrient dynamics of floating leaves of Nymphaea alba L. and Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm. were studied in four aquatic systems in The Netherlands, differing strongly in water quality. Production was 108-447 g AFDW.m<sup>-2</sup> for N. lutea and 319-348 g AFDW.m<sup>-2</sup> for N. alba. Turnover ranged from 3.6 to 4.4 without much difference between the sites and the species. During senescence 60-70% of the N and P from the leaves was resorbed by both of the plant species. The nutrient flow from the floating leaves into the detritus food chain differed considerably between the species and sites studied, mainly because of the differences in production. The data suggest that production is strongly influenced by the environment, whereas turnover and nutrient resorption during senescence seem to be plant characteristics. There was little difference in dynamics of the chlorophyll- concentration in the leaves of the two species, irrespective of the growing site. Floating leaves of both species lost about 70% of their area due to fragmentation in the alkaline waters, whereas in the acid water very little fragmentation was observed. 
1469151|Sequential sampling of precipitation under mature spruce trees and time-series analysis of the data were performed in order to assess, in natural conditions, the relative importance of different factors that could influence the leaching and uptake of inorganic ions in the canopy. Eleven rain events were analyzed in order to estimate how external factors, rain intensity, H<sup>+</sup>, and ionic concentration of the incident rain influence the ionic throughfall concentrations and the net throughfall fluxes. The results led to the conclusion that leaching or uptake mostly occur by diffusion. The influence of the open rain acidity was not conclusive; however, it was shown that the tested external factors only controlled a few percent of the variation of the data. By contrast, the autocorrelation of the data always explained a large portion of the variance. It could result from the gradual changes in the course time of internal factors related to the exchange system including waxes, cuticles, apoplast and xylem sap. These constituents were known to control the exchange at the canopy surface and to be sensitive to the plant physiology and environmental conditions.
24716795|Accurate quantification of total nitrogen and acidifying deposition is a major source of uncertainty in determining the exceedance of critical loads in forest ecosystems. Monitoring of atmospheric deposition is frequently based on throughfall measurements in combination with the canopy budget model to calculate ion-exchange fluxes between the forest canopy and incident rainfall water. Various approaches for each step in the canopy budget model have been reported and compared, but combinations of different approaches were not yet assessed. Therefore, the present study quantified the range of estimated dry deposition and total deposition resulting from all possible combinations of canopy budget model approaches for three typical case studies: (i) total nitrogen and potentially acidifying deposition onto a forest canopy, (ii) the ratio of these deposition variables between adjacent coniferous and deciduous stands and (iii) the parameters of a deposition time trend analysis. The time step, type of precipitation data and tracer ion used in the model had a significant effect on the findings in the three case studies. In addition, including or excluding canopy leaching of weak acids and canopy uptake of nitrogen during the leafless season largely affected the results, while including or excluding canopy uptake of nitrate generally showed no effect. In general, the use of wet-only precipitation data can be recommended, along with sodium as a tracer ion and the inclusion of weak acids. We conclude that further research should focus on the assumptions of inertness of the tracer ion and the equal deposition efficiency of base cations and the tracer ion and on the quantification of weak acids in rainfall and throughfall water. Since local or tree-species specific effects might influence the results obtained in this study, a similar analysis is recommended for other tree species and regions when using the canopy budget model.
24715135|Encroachment of nitrogen-fixing trees and shrubs into grasslands and savannas is a well-documented land cover change that occurs worldwide. In the Rio Grande Plains region of southern Texas, previous studies have shown woody encroachment by leguminous Prosopis glandulosa (mesquite) trees increases soil C and N, decreases microbial biomass N relative to soil N, and accelerates N mineralization and nitrification. We examined responses of the dominant organic N components in soil (amino acids and amino sugars) and two soil-bound protein-N acquiring enzymes (arylamidase and -N-acetylglucosaminidase) along a grassland-to-woodland successional chronosequence to determine changes to soil N chemistry and extractability. The proportion of total N held within amino compounds was significantly lower in the woodlands (47 %) relative to the grassland soils (62 %), This increase in non-hydrolysable N was accompanied by increases in plant cell wall derived amino acids (e.g. hydroxyproline, serine) and losses of microbial amino sugars, indicating the woodland organic N pool was altered in composition and potentially in quality, either because it was more structurally protected or difficult to degrade due to polymerization/condensation reactions. Soil carbon-normalized activities of both soil-bound N-acquiring enzymes were significantly higher in woodland soils, consistent with changes in the biochemical composition of organic N. Although soil total N increases following woody encroachment, this additional organic N appears to be less extractable by chemical hydrolysis and thus potentially in more refractory forms, which may limit microbial N accessibility, slow the cycling of soil organic carbon, and contribute to observed soil C and N accrual in these systems.
1469261|The effects of watershed liming on the exchange complex of a forest soil were investigated at Woods Lake, in the west-central Adirondack Park, New York. Attempts to neutralize lake acidity via direct application of calcite during the 1980's were short-lived due to a short hydraulic retention time. The Experimental Watershed Liming Study (EWLS) was initiated to investigate watershed base addition as a potentially more long-term strategy for mitigation of lake acidity. In this paper we discuss the changes in the exchangeable soil complex which occurred in response to the calcite addition and attempt a mass balance for calcite applied to the watershed. An extensive sampling program was initiated for the watershed study. Soil samples were collected from pits prior to and in the two years following treatment to evaluate changes in soil chemistry. Calcite addition significantly altered the exchange complex in the organic horizon. Increases in pH caused deprotonation of soil organic matter and increases in cation exchange capacity, providing additional exchange sites for the retention of added calcium. Exchangeable acidity decreased to very low values, allowing the base saturation of upper organic horizons to increase to nearly 100 percent. Post-treatment sampling found that approximately 48 percent of the calcite remained undissolved in the soil's Oe horizon two years later. Dissolution of the calcite was affected by field moisture conditions, with greater dissolution in wetter areas of the watershed. Mass balances calculated for calcium applied to the watershed suggest that only 4 percent of the calcium was removed through the lake outlet. Approximately 96 percent of the calcium applied remained within the watershed; as undissolved calcite, on soil exchange sites or stored in the vegetation, groundwater or surface waters of the watershed.
1469110|The chemical relationships among particulate and colloidal organic material and dissolved fulvic acid were examined in an alpine and subalpine lake and two streams in Loch Vale Watershed, Rocky Mountain National Park. The alpine lake, Sky Pond, had the lowest dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (0.37 mgC/L), the highest particulate carbon (POC) (0.13 mgC/L), and high algal biomass. The watershed of Sky Pond is primarily talus slope, and DOC and POC may be autochthonous. Both Andrews Creek and Icy Brook gain DOC as they flow through wet sedge meadows. The subalpine lake, The Loch, receives additional organic material from the surrounding forest and had a higher DOC (0.66 mgC/L). Elemental analysis, stable carbon isotopic compositon, and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR characterization showed that: 1) particulate material had relatively high inorganic contents and was heterogeneous in compositon, 2) colloidal material was primarily carbohydrate material with a low inorganic content at all sites; and 3) dissolved fulvic acid varied in compositon among sites. The low concentration and carbohydrate-rich character of the colloidal material suggests that this fraction is labile to microbial degradation and may be turning over more rapidly than particulate fractions or dissolved fulvic acid. Fulvic acid from Andrews Creek had the lowest N content and aromaticity, whereas Sky Pond fulvic acid had a higher N content and lower aromaticity than fulvic acid from The Loch. The UV-visible spectra of the fulvic acids demonstrate that variation in characteristics with sources of organic carbon can explain to some extent the observed nonlinear relationship between UV-B extinction coefficients and DOC concentrations in lakes.
1468839|Soil surface CO<sub>2</sub> flux was measured in hollow and hummock microhabitats in a peatland in north central Minnesota from June to October in 1991. We used a closed infrared gas exchange system to measure soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux. The rates of CO<sub>2</sub> evolution from hummocks (9.8 3.5 g m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, [mean SE]) were consistently higher than those from hollows (5.4 2.9 g m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) (the hummock values included the contribution of moss dark respiration, which may account for 10-20% of the total measured flux). The soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux was strongly temperature-dependent (Q<sub>10</sub> 3.7) and appeared to be linearly related to changes in water table depth. An empirical multiplicative model, using peat temperature and water table depth as independent variables, explained about 81% of the variance in the CO<sub>2</sub> flux data. Using the empirical model with measurements of peat temperature and estimates of hollow/hummock microtopographic distribution (relative to water table elevation), daily rates of "site-averaged" CO<sub>2</sub> evolution were calculated. For the six-month period (May-October), the total soil CO<sub>2</sub> released from this ecosystem was estimated to be about 1340 g CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>.
40343569|Vascular plants and associated microbial communities affect the nutrient resources of terrestrial ecosystems by impacting chemical weathering that transfers elements from primary minerals to other ecosystem pools, and chemical denudation that transports weathered elements out of the system in solution. We performed a year-long replicated flowthrough column growth experiment to isolate the effects of vascular plants, ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi and associated bacteria on chemical weathering and chemical denudation. The study focused on, Ca K and Mg, for which the sole sources were biotite and anorthite mixed into silica sand. Concentrations of the cations were measured in input and output solutions, and three times during the year in plant biomass and on exchangeable cation sites of the growth medium. Weathering and denudation fluxes were estimated by mass balance, and mineral surface changes, biofilm and microbial attachments to surfaces were investigated with scanning electron microscopy. Both bacteria and fungi increased weathering fluxes compared to abiotic controls. Without a host plant denudation rates were as large as weathering rates i.e. the weathering to denudation ratio was about one. Based on whole year fluxes, ectomycorrhizal seedlings produced the greatest weathering to denudation ratios (1.5). Non-ectomycorrhizal seedlings also showed a high ratio of 1.3. Both ectomycorrhizal hyphal networks and root hairs of non-ectomycorrhizal trees, embedded in biofilm (microorganisms surrounded by extracellular polymers), transferred nutrients to the host while drainage losses were minimized. These results suggest that biofilms localize both weathering and plant nutrient uptake, isolating the root-hypha-mineral interface from bulk soil solution.
1469045|The effects of three S deposition scenarios -- 50% reduction, no change, and 100% increase -- on the cycles of N, P, S, K, Ca, and Mg in a mixed deciduous forest at Coweeta, North Carolina, were simulated using the Nutrient Cycling model (NuCM). The purpose of this exercise was to compare NuCM's output to observed soil and streamwater chemical changes and to explore NuCM's response to varying S deposition scenarios. Ecosystem S content and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> leaching were controlled almost entirely by soil SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption in the simulations, which was in turn governed by the nature of the Langmuir isotherm set in the model. Both the simulations and the 20-year trends in streamwater SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration suggest that the ecosystem is slowly becoming S saturated. The streamwater data suggest S saturation is occurring at a slower rate than indicated by the simulations, perhaps because of underestimation of organic S retention in the model. Both the simulations and field data indicated substantial declines in exchangeable bases in A and BA soil horizons, primarily due to vegetation uptake. The correspondence of model output with field data in this case was a result of after-the-fact calibration (i.e. setting weathering rates to very low values) rather than prediction, however. Model output suggests that soil exchangeable cation pools change rapidly, undergoing annual cycles and multi-decade fluctuations. Varying S deposition had very little effect upon simulated vegetation growth nutrient uptake, or N cycling. Varying S deposition strongly affected simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and P leaching but caused little change in soil exchangeable pools of Ca<sup>2+</sup> K<sup>+</sup>, or P because soil exchangeable pools were large relative to fluxes. Soil exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup> pools were reduced by high rates of S deposition but remained well above levels sufficient for tree growth. Although the total soil pools of exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> were only slightly affected by S deposition, there was a redistribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> from upper to lower horizons with increasing S deposition, causing increased base saturation in the deepest (BC) horizon. The 100% increased S deposition scenario caused increasing peaks in simulated Al<sup>3+</sup> concentrations in A horizons after 25 years as a result of large seasonal pulses of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and lowered base saturation. Simulated soil solution Al<sup>3+</sup> concentrations remained well below toxicity thresholds for selected tree species at the site.
4151486|High elevation alpine and subalpine Rocky Mountain lakes in Colorado and south- eastern Wyoming were examined to determine regional variability in water chemistry and their sensitivity to atmospheric deposition. Acid neutralizing capacity, pH, conductivity and concentrations of major anions and cations were compared. Regional differences in water chemistry are evident. The south-eastern most lakes have significantly higher pH, conductivity, ANC, and sums of acid and base concentrations than lakes in the other regions of the state. In contrast the north- western most lakes are significantly more dilute than those from other regions. Despite these two regional differences, most regions are similar in having a wide range of variability in potential sensitivity of their lakes to acidification and nitrogen export. Many wilderness areas in western and eastern regions contains lakes that are extremely sensitive and other lakes not susceptible to deposition. Overall, 70% of the Colorado lakes are sensitive to acidification and 15% are extremely sensitive to acidification. All of the regions had lakes that are classified as susceptible or sensitive to acidification, with 12 of the 17 areas having all of their sampled lakes susceptible or sensitive. Generally
24716793|Altitude encompasses broad environmental gradients that influence the isotopic composition of lake water. We selected 55 lakes in the Eastern Alps along an altitudinal gradient [2142,532 m above sea level (a.s.l.)] to model the isotopic signal of surface water dependent on intrinsic (lake geomorphometry) and extrinsic (air temperature, precipitation) factors. Ordinary and generalised least squared regression were used for statistical analysis. The isotope signal of lake water was lower in spring than in summer and decreased with altitude (0.21 O /100 m; 1.5 H /100 m). This pattern largely depended on temperature and a pseudo-latitude effect. The isotopic signal in monthly precipitation (12 stations; altitudinal gradient 902,730 m a.s.l.) generally showed the expected pattern of less enriched values with altitude; however, unusual values were related to weather anomalies. The local meteoric water line was similar to the global meteoric water line as shown by overlapping confidence intervals. By discriminating different elevational bands, we could show that high elevation lakes (>1,500 m a.s.l.) experience different patterns of evaporation with respect to low elevation lakes (<1,500 m a.s.l.). Our study showed that lakes have a unique isotopic fingerprint along an altitudinal gradient, potentially useful for tracing ecological processes and for paleoclimatic studies.
20055215|Restored forested wetlands reduce N loads in surface discharge through plant uptake and denitrification. While removal of reactive N reduces impact on receiving waters, it is unclear whether enhanced denitrification also enhances emissions of the 'greenhouse' gas NO, thus compromising the water-quality benefits of restoration. This study compares denitrification rates and NO:N emission ratios from Sharkey clay soil in a mature bottomland forest to those from an adjacent cultivated site in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Potential denitrification of forested soil was 2.4 times of cultivated soil. Using intact soil cores, denitrification rates of forested soil were 5.2, 6.6 and 2.0 times those of cultivated soil at 70, 85 and 100% water-filled pore space (WFPS), respectively. When NO was added, NO emissions from forested soil were 2.2 times those of cultivated soil at 70% WFPS. At 85 and 100% WFPS, NO emissions were not significantly different despite much greater denitrification rates in the forested soil because NO:N emission ratios declined more rapidly in forested soil as WFPS increased. These findings suggest that restoration of forested wetlands to reduce NO in surface discharge will not contribute significantly to the atmospheric burden of NO.
40343566|Substantial transformations of biogeochemical phosphorus (P) fractions can occur within a few hundreds of years under humid and tropical conditions; however, slower changes are expected under dry and temperate climate. The objective of this study was to infer P transformations over time by comparing suspended sediments in the Danube River to floodplain soils developed from such sediments over different time periods in the continental climate of Central Europe. We analyzed suspended sediments from 20 flood events between 1990 and 2006, and floodplain soils from seven sites along a chronosequence covering about 500 yrs. The studied flood sediments had similar characteristics over the 16-yr observation period. Total phosphorus (TP) averaged 732 mg kg, and biogeochemical fractionation yielded important primary mineral contributions (apatite phosphorus, AP, ~80% of TP). The TP concentrations of the floodplain soils were in the range of the Danube sediments and showed little variation along the chronosequence. However, the distribution of P among biogeochemical fractions changed considerably in less than 500 yrs of soil development. The youngest soils (<20 yrs) were dominated by AP, as was observed for the Danube sediments. In less than 250 yrs of pedogenesis, AP markedly decreased and organic phosphorus (OP) increased, and in less than 500 yrs, OP reached AP levels. This shows that while P biogeochemistry in very young floodplain soils is strongly related to the river sediments, significant transformations can occur in less than 250 yrs of soil development in the dry and temperate climate of Central Europe.
24715204|Salinity changes resulting from storm surge, tides, precipitation, and stormwater run-off are common in coastal wetlands. Soil microbial communities respond quickly to salinity changes, altering the rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and associated biogeochemical processes. This study quantified the impact of salinity-altering pulses on SOC loss, defined as microbial respiration (CO flux) at high and low tide, CH flux, and dissolved OC (DOC) release, in 3 intertidal wetlands (Jacksonville, FL, USA). Intact soil cores from a freshwater tidal, brackish, and salt marsh were exposed to simulated tides and 3 salinity pulsing events during a 53-day laboratory experiment. Soil and water physio-chemical properties, nutrient release, and microbial indicators were measured. Microbial respiration was the dominate pathway of SOC loss (>97 %). Soil hydraulic conductivity was greater in brackish and salt marshes and was critical to overall soil respiration. High tide CO flux was greatest in the freshwater marsh (58 % of SOC loss) and positively correlated with DOC concentration; low tide CO flux was greatest in brackish and salt marshes (62 and 70 % of SOC loss, respectively) and correlated with NH and microbial biomass. The freshwater marsh was sensitive to brackish pulses, causing a 112 % increase in respiration, presumably from accelerated sulfate reduction and N-cycling. SOC loss increased in the salt marsh pulsed with freshwater, suggesting freshwater run-off may reduce a salt marsh's ability to keep-pace with sea level rise. Increased inundation from storm surges could accelerate SOC loss in freshwater marshes, while decreasing SOC loss in brackish and salt marshes.
1469038|The effect of soil microbial processes on production and/or consumption of atmospheric trace gases was studied in four different soils which were preincubated in the presence of elevated concentrations of CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or CO, to simulate the growth of the resident populations of methanotrophic, nitrifying, or carboxydotrophic bacteria, respectively. Oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub>, both at atmospheric (1.8 ppmv) and at elevated (3500 ppmv) CH<sub>4</sub> mixing ratios, was stimulated after preincubation with CH<sub>4</sub>, but not with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or CO, indicating that CH<sub>4</sub> was oxidized by methanotrophic, but not by nitrifying or carboxydotrophic bacteria. However, the oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> was partially inhibited by addition of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and CO. Analogously, oxidation of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was partially inhibited by addition of CH<sub>4</sub>. Oxidation of CO at elevated mixing ratios (2300 ppmv) was stimulated after preincubation with CO, indicating oxidation by carboxydotrophs, but was also stimulated at a small extent after preincubation with CH<sub>4</sub>, suggesting the involvement of methanotrophs. At atmospheric CO mixing ratios (0.13 ppmv), on the other hand, oxidation of CO was stimulated after preincubation with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, indicating that the activity was due to nitrifiers. NO uptake was stimulated in soils preincubated with CH<sub>4</sub>, indicating the involvement of methanotrophs. However, production of N<sub>2</sub>O was only stimulated, if CH<sub>4</sub> was added as a substrate. The results indicate that especially the methanotrophic and nitrifying populations in soil not only oxidize their specific substrates, but are also involved in the metabolism of other compounds.
1469141|The mass balance for total nitrogen (N) was studied over a four-year period in 16 shallow mainly eutrophic 1st order Danish lakes. Water was sampled in the main inlet of each lake 18-26 times annually, and from the outlets and the lake 19 times annually. Water was also sampled from minor inlets, although less frequently. N input and output were calculated using daily data on discharge (Q), the latter being obtained either from the Q/H relationship based on automatic recordings of water level (H) for the main in- and outlet, or by means of Q/Q relationships for the minor inlets. Annual mean N retention in the lakes ranged from 47 to 234 mg N m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>, and was particularly high in lakes with high N loading. Annual percentage retention (N<sub>ret-y%</sub>) ranged from 11 to 72%. Non-linear regression analysis revealed that hydraulic retention time and mean depth accounted for 75% of the variation in annual mean N<sub>ret-y%</sub> and, in combination with inlet N concentration, accounted for 84% of the variation in the in-lake N concentration. N<sub>ret%</sub> varied according to season, being higher in the second and third quarter than in the first and fourth quarter (median 18-19%). A simple model was developed for predicting monthly nitrogen retention (N<sub>ret-m)</sub> on the basis of external N loading, the lake water pool of nitrogen N<sub>pool</sub>, hydraulic loading and lake water temperature. Calibration of only two parameters on data from the randomly selected 8 out of 16 lakes rendered the model capable of accurately simulating seasonal dynamics of the in-lake N concentration and N<sub>ret-m</sub> in all 16 lakes. We conclude that with regard to shallow, eutrophic lakes with a relatively low hydraulic retention time, it is now possible to determine not only annual mean nitrogen retention, but also the seasonal variation in N<sub>ret-m</sub>. Prediction of seasonal variation in N loading of downstream N-limited coastal areas is thereby rendered much more reliable.
20055236|Here we report the results of a comprehensive biogeochemical monitoring of Rostherne Mere in 1998, including changes in dissolved oxygen, organic carbon and nitrogen, nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, Al, Na, S, K, Mg, Ca, Si, Fe, Mn, orthophosphate, particulate N & P, suspended solids, temperature, pH, chlorophyll-a and zooplankton. The results demonstrated the major influence of primary producers on the overall geochemical cycling of N, P and Si, and suggested that the significance of zooplankton might have been previously underestimated. For major anions and cations, however, the influence of biota on lake water concentrations appeared to be negligible, reflecting the fact that these chemicals were present far in excess of plankton requirements. Thus changes in concentrations of Ca, K, Na, Mg and S were rather limited and must have reflected changes in hydrological and meteorological parameters. K, however, demonstrated a transitional pattern, reflecting some influence of biological uptake. During the stratification period, the slow processes of bacterial decomposition in the hypolimnion gradually released chemicals contained in the materials accumulated in the bottom layer, remarkably increasing the concentrations of dissolved compounds of those elements present in amounts comparable with the pool stored in the sedimenting detritus (e.g. orthophosphate P, ammonia N, Si and DOC). The decomposition also resulted in a drop in the redox potential, followed by partial denitrification and chemical release from the sediments. The hypolimnion of the Mere was confirmed to remain at the stage of Mn release, characterised by accumulation of DOC, orthophosphates, ammonia and initial stages of denitrification. High levels of P released from the sediments during the stratification period suggest that the lake's recovery after sewage diversion might be further delayed.
1468631|The present level of understanding of P controls on organic matter accumulation and cycling in a pedological context owes much to soil sequence studies, and the hypotheses that emerged from them to explain the variation of P compounds with soil type and development. It is now widely accepted that nutrient transformations in soil are closely linked through a more dynamic biological cycle in which microorganisms have a central role. Concepts developed to account for the effects of P on N cycling, and for interpreting inter-relationships of C, N, P and S in both a pedological and biological context have yet to be tested adequately across different ecosystems. These concepts are discussed, in relation to some recent supporting evidence.
20519874|To evaluate the impact of human behavior (with regard food consumption, waste disposal and farming method) on nitrogen flow, a field investigation was conducted in six typical ecosystems in China. A number of parameters for regional nitrogen balance models were identified during the investigation. The results show that the average percapita daily protein intake is 107 g. While there is an insignificant difference in total protein intake among the different ecosystems, protein intake from all food groups, except for eggs, is significantly different (P  0.05). Differences in diet, along with those in socio-economic conditions, reflect differences in the characteristics of the ecosystems. Regarding percapita annual potential nitrogen loading from human excrement, a considerable difference exists between the urban rich and the rural poor. In urban areas, approximately 1.02 kg N is returned to farmlands and 5.49 kg N is directly discharged into rivers. In rural regions, on the other hand, approximately 4.33 kg N is returned to farmlands and 1.60 kg N is directly discharged into rivers. Furthermore, urea and mixed fertilizers constitute the most common chemical fertilizers in the study area. Fertilizer diversification is practiced in a range of agricultural lands, paddy-fields and irrigated plains. In the oasis and paddy-field agricultural systems, many of the agricultural by-products (e.g., straw) are burned or mixed with base-fertilizers and plowed into the soil. In irrigated agricultural systems, over 70% of agricultural by-products are recycled as livestock feed. In most instances, livestock excrement is directly reduced in the pasturelands or reused in the fields as manure. Occasionally, as in the case of large-scale breeding, excrements are usually abandoned.
1468959| The origin and temporal variation in composition of sedimented particulate organic matter (POM) in the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic) was studied over the year with special reference to the composition and sedimentation of macroaggregates in summer of 1991 using sediment traps. Suspended and sedimented POM, comprising a minor part of the largely inorganic total particulate matter, was prevalently of marine origin and composed mostly of humic substances followed by carbohydrates and proteins. Seasonal variations of particulate proteins and carbohydrates were correlated with variations of phytoplankton biomass. 'New' production, occurring in late spring as a consequence of massive riverine inputs of N, Si and P nutrients in the surface layer of the Gulf, produced high particulate carbohydrate and protein concentrations. Subsequent depletion of introduced nutrients caused the decrease of particulate protein concentration but not that of particulate carbohydrate. The prolonged plankton biosynthesis of carbohydrates successively produced marine snow and later macroaggregates. The macroaggregates were characterized by  <sup>13</sup>C value of -19.9 and their carbohydrates were mostly composed of glucose followed in decreasing order by mannose, fructose, galactose, arabinose, ribose, xylose and fucose, suggesting a prevalent origin from phytoplankton structural heteropolysaccharides. Sedimentation of particulate organic constituents in the summertime, characterized by the massive presence of macroaggregates in the surface layer above the pycnocline, was the highest at a depth of 10 m at the end of this phenomenon, about six weeks after its first appearance. Sedimented macroaggregates were clearly traced by a characteristic  <sup>13</sup>C signal and higher carbohydrate concentrations. The monosaccharide composition was influenced by selective degradation in the water column. Sedimented POM in the bottom layer was, on the other hand, more affected by sediment resuspension. The mean yearly decrease of particulate protein-C and carbohydrate-C by 40-50% in the water column between the depths of 10 and 20 m indicates the preferential utilization of these constituents by microorganisms. The decrease of particulate humic-C is probably more the result of the export of particulate matter from the Gulf. This study also indicates that the macroaggregate formation has little impact on the annual C and N budget in such coastal areas. 
1469775|The mean depth of Sr and water uptake in mixed Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands was investigated, using natural variations of <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr and <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O in soils in relation to depth. Three spruce-pine pairs were studied on a podzol and a peat site in Northern Sweden. Tree leaf and wood, as well as soils, soil solutions and roots below each tree were analysed for Sr and Ca concentrations and <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio. The <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O ratio was also determined in xylem sap and soil solutions in relation to depth. Soil solution <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O decreased in relation to depth. Comparing with xylem sap <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O data indicated a deeper uptake of soil water by pine than spruce on the podzol site and a superficial uptake by both species on the peat. The <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio of bioavailable Sr generally increased in soils in relation to depth. Contrastingly, the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio in spruce wood was generally higher than in pine wood suggesting a deeper uptake of Sr by spruce. But the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio and concentrations of bioavailable Sr were systematically higher below spruce than below pine. In order to explain these unexpected results, we built a simple flux model to investigate the possible effects of interspecific variations in Sr cycling, soil mineral weathering and depth of Sr uptake on soil and tree <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio. At the study sites, spruce cycled in litterfall up to 12 times more strontium than pine. The use of the model showed that this difference in Sr cycling could alone explain higher isotopic signatures of trees and topsoils below spruce. Besides, high isotopic signatures of roots in the A/E horizons below spruce led us to hypothesise a species-specific weathering process. Finally, the comparison between the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratios in wood and root or soil solutions below each species suggested that the average depth of Sr and water uptake were close, but irregular variations of the Sr isotopic ratio with depth reduce the accuracy of the results. Tree species strongly influence Sr isotopic ratios in boreal forest soils through differences in Sr cycling, and possibly through specific mineral weathering.
1469281|Methane emission from rice grown in flooded soil was measured in pot experiments using headspaces with different gas composition. The emission rates varied with the atmospheric composition. Based on the kinetic theory of gases the binary diffusion coefficients for methane in various gases were calculated. The ratios of the measured emissions under a certain atmosphere relative to that in air were similar to the ratios of the binary diffusion coefficients showing that plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> transport is driven by diffusion. Small deviations from the theoretical ratios of emissions support the hypothesis that mass flow of gas to the submerged parts of the rice plant may depress the upward diffusive CH<sub>4</sub> flux. The results in combination with data from the literature suggest that the rate limiting step in plant-mediated methane transport is diffusion of CH<sub>4</sub> across the root/shoot junction.
20055307|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is an important fraction in carbon (C) and nutrient budgets for aquatic ecosystems and can have broad effects on food webs and nutrient cycling. To look at the role land use cover and climate might play in DOM transport from the boreal region, the export of total organic carbon (TOC), total organic nitrogen (TON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) was estimated for Finnish main rivers and their sub-catchments, altogether 86 catchments, situated between latitudes 60 N and 69 N and covering 297,322 km, 88% of the total area of Finland. On an average, 94% of the TOC, 90% of the total nitrogen (TN) and 40% of the total phosphorus (TP) in Finnish rivers was in a dissolved form. The majority of the DOM export from Finnish catchments consists of organic C. The TOC export increased with increasing peatland proportion (r = 0.39, p = 0.003), while TON export increased with the increasing percentage of agricultural land (r = 0.60, p &lt 0.001). Although upstream lakes covered only on average 9% of the catchment area, they were the most important predictor for TOC, TON and DOP export (r = -0.83, r = -0.82 and r = -0.61, respectively). The higher the upstream lake percentage, the lower the export indicating organic matter retention in lakes.
1469642|The widespread occurrence of N limitation to net primary production (NPP) and other ecosystem processes, despite the ubiquitous occurrence of N-fixing symbioses, remains a significant puzzle in terrestrial ecology. We describe a simple simulation model for an ecosystem containing a generic nonfixer and a symbiotic N fixer, based on: (1) a higher cost for N acquisition by N fixers than nonfixers; (2) growth of fixers and fixation of N only when low N availability limits the growth of nonfixers, and other resources are available; and (3) losses of fixed N from the system only when the quantity of available N exceeds plant and microbial demands. Despite the disadvantages faced by the N fixer under these conditions, N fixation and loss adjust N availability close to the availability of other resources, and biomass and NPP in this simple model can be substantially but only transiently N limited. We then modify the model by adding: (1) losses of N in forms other than excess available N (e.g., dissolved organic N, trace gases produced by nitrification); and (2) constraints to the growth and activity of N fixers imposed by differential effects of shading, P limitation, and grazing. The combination of these processes is sufficient to describe an open system, with input from both precipitation and N fixation, that is nevertheless strongly N-limited at equilibrium. This model is useful for exploring causes and consequences of constraints to N fixation, and hence of N limitation, and we believe it will also be useful for evaluating how N fixation and limitation interact with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and other components of global enviromental change.
20055304|The dissolved CO concentration of stream waters is an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and an important pathway for release of CO to the atmosphere. This study uses data from the UK's largest groundwater monitoring network to estimate the importance of groundwater in contributing excess dissolved CO to the atmosphere. The study shows that: (i) the arithmetic mean concentration of excess dissolved CO in the groundwater was 4.99 mg C/l with a standard deviation of 2.53 (ii) for the groundwater composition of excess dissolved CO analysis shows no statistical difference between years but does show a significant intra-annual effect and a significant difference between aquifers (iii) A weighted average of the estimate the areal export of excess dissolved CO from the groundwater of the catchment is between 1.4 and 2.9 t C/km/year. (iv) the flux of excess dissolved CO at the catchment outlet over the period between 1975 and 2002 averages 1.79 kt C/year. If this were replicated across the UK then the flux of CO from rivers would be 0.65 Mt C/year.
1469704|Soil weathering can be an important mechanism to neutralize acidity in forest soils. Tree species may differ in their effect on or response to soil weathering. We used soil mineral data and the natural strontium isotope ratio <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr as a tracer to identify the effect of tree species on the Ca weathering rate. The tree species studied were sugar maple (Acer saccharum), hemlock (Tsuga Canadensis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), red maple (Acer rubrum), white ash (Fraxinus Americana) and red oak (Quercus rubra) growing in a forest in northwestern Connecticut, USA. Three replicated sites dominated by one of the six tree species were selected. At sugar maple and hemlock sites the dominant mineral concentrations were determined at three soil depths. At each site soil, soil water and stem wood of the dominant tree species were sampled and analyzed for the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio, total Sr and Ca content. Atmospheric deposition was collected and analyzed for the same constituents. Optical analysis showed that biotite and plagioclase concentrations were lower in the soil beneath hemlock than beneath sugar maple and suggested species effects on mineral weathering in the upper 10 cm of the mineral soil. These results could not be confirmed with data obtained by the Sr isotope study. Within the sensitivity of the Sr isotope method, we could not detect tree species effects on Ca weathering and calculated Ca weathering rates were low at all sites (< 60 mg m<sup>-2</sup>yr<sup>-1</sup>). We found a positive correlation between Ca weathering and the total Ca concentration in the surface soil. These results indicate that the absolute differences in Ca weathering rate between tree species in these acidic surface soils are small and are more controlled by the soil parent material (plagioclase content) than by tree species.
24715096|Mobile sources are the single largest source of nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere in the US. It is likely that a portion of mobile-source emissions are deposited adjacent to roads and thus not measured by traditional monitoring networks, which were designed to measure long-term and regional trends in deposition well away from emission sources. To estimate the magnitude of near-source nitrogen deposition, we measured concentrations of both dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and total dissolved nitrogen (inorganic + organic) (TDN) in throughfall (i.e., the nitrogen that comes through the forest canopy) along transects perpendicular to two moderately trafficked roads on Cape Cod in Falmouth MA, coupled with measurements of both DIN and TDN in bulk precipitation made in adjacent open fields at the same transect distances. We used the TDN throughfall data to estimate total nitrogen deposition, including dry gaseous nitrogen deposition in addition to wet deposition and dry particle deposition. There was no difference in TDN in the bulk collectors along the transects at either site; however TDN in the throughfall collectors was always higher closest to the road and decreased with distance. These patterns were driven primarily by differences in the inorganic N and not the organic N. Annual throughfall deposition was 8.7 (0.4) and 6.8 (0.5) TDN kg N ha year at sites 10 and 150 m away from the road respectively. We also characterized throughfall away from a non-road edge (power line right-of-way) to test whether the increased deposition observed near road edges was due to deposition near emission sources or due to a physical, edge effect causing higher deposition. The increased deposition we observed near roads was due to increases in inorganic N especially NH. This increased deposition was not the result of an edge effect; rather it is due to near source deposition of mobile source emissions. We scaled these results to the entire watershed and estimate that by not taking into account the effects of increased gaseous N deposition from mobile sources we are underestimating the amount of N deposition to the watershed by 1325 %.
40343589|The change of current pools of soil C in Norway spruce ecosystems in Sweden were studied using a process-based model (CoupModel). Simulations were conducted for four sites representing different regions covering most of the forested area in Sweden and representing annual mean temperatures from 0.7C to 7.1C. The development of both tree layer and field layer (understory) was simulated during a 100-year period using data on standing stock volumes from the Swedish Forest Inventory to calibrate tree growth using different assumptions regarding N supply to the plants. The model successfully described the general patterns of forest stand dynamics along the Swedish climatic transect, with decreasing tree growth rates and increasing field layer biomass from south to north. However, the current tree growth pattern for the northern parts of Sweden could not be explained without organic N uptake and/or enhanced mineralisation rates compared to the southern parts. Depending on the assumption made regarding N supply to the tree, different soil C sequestration rates were obtained. The approach to supply trees with both mineralised N and organic N, keeping the soil C:N ratio constant during the simulation period was found to be the most realistic alternative. With this approach the soils in the northern region of Sweden lost 5 g C m year, the soils in the central region lost 2 g C m year, and the soils in the two southern regions sequestered 9 and 23 g C m year, respectively. In addition to climatic effects, the feedback between C and N turnover plays an important role that needs to be more clearly understood to improve estimates of C sequestration in boreal forest ecosystems.
20055280|The projected increase in global mean temperature could accelerate the turnover of soil organic matter (SOM). Enhanced soil CO emissions could feedback on the climate system, depending on the balance between the sensitivity to temperature of net carbon fixation by vegetation and SOM decomposition. Most of the SOM is stabilised by several physico-chemical mechanisms within the soil architecture, but the response of this quantitatively important fraction to increasing temperature is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to relate the temperature sensitivity of decomposition of physical and chemical soil fractions (size fractions, hydrolysis residues), and of bulk soil, to their quality and turnover time. Soil samples were taken from arable and grassland soils from the Swiss Central Plateau, and CO production was measured under strictly controlled conditions at 5, 15, 25, and 35 C by using sequential incubation. Physico-chemical properties of the samples were characterised by measuring elemental composition, surface area,
20055206|To investigate the potential role of microbial community composition in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, we transplanted soil cores between a grassland and a conifer ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada California and measured soil process rates (N-mineralization, nitrous oxide and carbondioxide flux, nitrification potential), soil water and temperature, and microbial community parameters (PLFA and substrate utilization profiles) over a 2 year period. Our goal was to assess whether microbial community composition could be related to soil process rates independent of soil temperature and water content. We performed multiple regression analyses using microbial community parameters and soil water and temperature as X-variables and soil process rates and inorganic N concentrations as Y-variables. We found that field soil temperature had the strongest relationship with CO production and soil NH concentration, while microbial community characteristics correlated with NO production, nitrification potential, gross N-mineralization, and soil NO concentration, independent of environmentalcontrollers. We observed a relationship between specific components of the microbial community (as determined by PLFA) and soil processes,particularly processes tightly linked to microbial phylogeny (e.g. nitrification). The most apparent change in microbial community composition in response to the 2 year transplant was a change in relative abundance of fungi (there was only one significant change in PLFA biomarkers for bacteria during 2 years). The relationship between microbial community composition and soil processes suggests that prediction of ecosystem response to environmental change may be improved by recognizing and accounting for changes in microbial community composition and physiological ecology.
41490497|Extensive interfluvial wetlands occur in the upper Negro River basin (Brazil) and contain a mosaic of vegetation dominated by emergent grasses and sedges with patches of shrubs and palms. To characterize the release of carbon dioxide and methane from these habitats, diffusive and ebullitive emissions and transport through plant aerenchyma were measured monthly during 2005 in permanently and seasonally flooded areas. CO emissions averaged 2193 mg C m day. Methane was consumed in unflooded environments and emitted in flooded environments with average values of 4.8 and 60 mg C m day, respectively. Bubbles were emitted primarily during falling water periods when hydrostatic pressure at the sediment-water interface declined. CO and CH emissions increased when dissolved O decreased and vegetation was more abundant. Total area and seasonally varying flooded areas for two wetlands, located north and south of the Negro River, were determined through analysis of synthetic aperture radar and optical remotely sensed data. The combined areas of these two wetlands (3000 km) emitted 1147 Gg C year as CO and 31 Gg C year as CH. If these rates are extrapolated to the area occupied by hydromorphic soils in the upper Negro basin, 63 Tg C year of CO and 1.7 Tg C year as CH are estimated as the regional evasion to the atmosphere.
1468534| This paper presents data obtained between 1983 and 1989 on concentration of heavy metals in sediments of five Cuban bays having different physical and geographical characteristics and differing degrees of anthropogenic activities. Data are normalized with respect to Al, Fe, and organic content and processed through statistical techniques of multivariate analysis. The degree of heavy metal pollution among the harbors decreases in the following order: Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Cienfuegos  Matanzas, Crdenas. 
23359736|Rapid immobilization of inorganic nitrogen (N) in soil contributes to ecosystem N accumulation, even in old-growth and chronically-fertilized forests once thought to have poor N retention capacity. In old-growth conifer and hardwood stands in Pennsylvania, we tested the hypotheses that biotic and abiotic N immobilization are regulated by N form and forest type. We added 15 NH 4 + , 15 NO 2 - , and 15 NO 3 - to sterile (-irradiated) and live organic-horizon soil and define N immobilization as the mass of added 15 N remaining in soil following extractions conducted 15 min, 24 h, and 21 days later. Immobilization of NO 2 - (1925% of added N) occurred in sterile soils within 15 min and was little changed thereafter. Tracer NO 3 - immobilization was not observed, although soils had been pretreated (refrigerated) so as to quantify the lower limit of immobilization potential. Immobilization of NH 4 + (27%) occurred in live conifer soils by 21 days but not in other treatments. In 21-day incubations, tracer N immobilization was greater in NO 3 - -poor and humic-rich soils. Immobilization was greater in sterile than in live soil, perhaps owing to artifacts of sterilization. Conifer stands exhibited more massive O-horizons, so NO 2 - immobilization per unit area was greater in conifer (1.46 mg N m -2 ) than hardwood (0.43 mg N m -2 ) stands, possibly accounting for lower N leaching from conifer forests. Areal immobilization rates appear to be fast enough to retain all N transformed to NO 2 - , so NO 2 - production may be a limiting step in soil N retention in old-growth ecosystems.
25652605|Despite increasing recognition that free amino acids can be an important source of N for plant uptake, we have a poor understanding of environmental variation in the availability of amino-acid N in soils outside of arctic, alpine and boreal regions. I investigated patterns of amino-acid availability along a temperate forest fertility gradient ranging from low mineral N availability, oak-dominated forests to high mineral N availability, maple-basswood forests (5 sites). I measured standing pools of free amino acids, soluble peptides, ammonium and nitrate, rates of amino acid production (native proteolysis activity) and rates of consumption of a N-labeled leucine tracer. Standing pools of amino acid N decreased consistently along the fertility gradient from the low fertility black oak/white oak system to the high fertility sugar maple/basswood system, with a 25-fold difference in pool sizes between the poorest and richest sites. Standing pools of soluble peptides varied little among sites, instead, the relationship between free amino acids and peptides changed markedly across the gradient. At low fertility sites free amino acids were positively correlated with soluble peptides, whereas free amino acid pools were universally low at high fertility sites, regardless of peptide pools. Assays for native proteolysis activity indicated that amino acid production did not vary significantly among sites. Recovery of leucine tracer in inorganic (NH and NO) pools and in residual soil organic matter both increased with increasing soil fertility; however, total consumption of the added amino-acid tracer did not vary among sites. Results from this study demonstrate that free amino acids can make an important contribution to potentially plant-available N pools in temperate forest soils, particularly at low fertility sites.
1468740|Recent measurements have made it possible to revise and improve the phosphorus budget of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, including partitioning P uptake by vegetation from the forest floor and mineral soil and estimating net P mineralization in the forest floor. Both living biomass and forest floor are accumlating P (at rates of 1.3 and 0.16 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> respectively) in this 70-yr old northern hardwood forest. About 61% of the P taken up by the vegetation each year comes from the forest floor (5.9 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of a total 9.6 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), even though the P content of this pool is just 5% of that in mineral soil. The turnover rate of P in the forest floor is 7% yr<sup>-1</sup>, while that of the mineral soil is 0.3% yr<sup>-1</sup>. Recycling of P in the forest floor is very efficient; of the 5.6 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> net mineralization in the forest floor, only 0.3 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> leaches into the mineral soil; the rest is taken up by plants. This tight recycling of P is important because P is less readily available in the mineral soil than in the forest floor.
41490543|As the earth system changes in response to human activities, a critical objective is to predict how biogeochemical process rates (e.g. nitrification, decomposition) and ecosystem function (e.g. net ecosystem productivity) will change under future conditions. A particular challenge is that the microbial communities that drive many of these processes are capable of adapting to environmental change in ways that alter ecosystem functioning. Despite evidence that microbes can adapt to temperature, precipitation regimes, and redox fluctuations, microbial communities are typically not optimally adapted to their local environment. For example, temperature optima for growth and enzyme activity are often greater than in situ temperatures in their environment. Here we discuss fundamental constraints on microbial adaptation and suggest specific environments where microbial adaptation to climate change (or lack thereof) is most likely to alter ecosystem functioning. Our framework is based on two principal assumptions. First, there are fundamental ecological trade-offs in microbial community traits that occur across environmental gradients (in time and space). These trade-offs result in shifting of microbial function (e.g. ability to take up resources at low temperature) in response to adaptation of another trait (e.g. limiting maintenance respiration at high temperature). Second, the mechanism and level of microbial community adaptation to changing environmental parameters is a function of the potential rate of change in community composition relative to the rate of environmental change. Together, this framework provides a basis for developing testable predictions about how the rate and degree of microbial adaptation to climate change will alter biogeochemical processes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across the planet.
20519827|Savannas are the most common vegetation type in the tropics and subtropics, ranging in physiognomy from grasslands with scattered woody plants to woodlands with heterogeneous grass cover. Productivity and organic matter turnover in savannas are controlled by interactions between water and nutrient availability, and this basic environmental structure is modified by fire frequency and land management practices. We compared temperate and tropical savannas in order to understand the strength of nitrogen (N) limitation of productivity. American tropical and temperate savannas are N limited systems, and the N cycle differs according to the woody plant density, fire frequency, land use change, N deposition and N fixation. Grazing and conversion to pasture have been the predominant land-use changes in most savannas. In the Cerrado and the Llanos tropical savannas, intensified use of fire for pasture management is leading to decreased woody plant density. Oppositely, in the Chaco and North American temperate savannas, fire suppression and grazing are leading to increases in woody density. In addition, the higher soil P availability in the Gran Chaco and the higher N deposition in North American savannas may be contributing to increases of N cycling and net productivity rates. Some aspects of the N budget for savannas of the American continent are still unclear and require further analysis to determine rates of N fixation, and to understand how spatial and temporal soil heterogeneity control N fluxes through soil solution and into streams.
40980885|Soil organic matter (SOM) increases with time as landscape is restored. Studying SOM development along restored forest chronosequences would be useful in clarifying some of the uncertainties in quantifying C turnover rates with respect to forest clearance and ensuing restoration. The development of soil organic matter in the mineral soils was studied at four depths in a 16-year-old restored jarrah forest chronosequence. The size-separated SOM fractionation along with C isotopic shift was utilised to resolve the soil C temporal and spatial changes with developing vegetation. The restored forest chronosequence revealed several important insights into how soil C is developing with age. Litter accumulation outpaced the native forest levels in 12 years after restoration. The surface soils, in general, showed increase in total C with age, but this trend was not clearly observed at lower depths. C accumulation was observed with increasing restoration age in all three SOM size-fractions in the surface 0-2 cm depth. These biodiverse forests show a trend towards accumulating C in recalcitrant stable forms, but only in the surface 0-2 cm mineral soil. A significant reverse trend was observed for the moderately labile SOM fraction for lower depths with increasing restoration age. Correlating the soil C with total C concentration revealed the re-establishment of the isotopically depleted labile to enriched refractory C continuum with soil depth for the older restored sites. This implied that from a pedogenic perspective, the restored soils are developing towards the original native soil carbon profile.
23359721|The climatically-important compound dimethylsulfide (DMS) has been reported to be abundant in the Arctic, particularly in the marginal sea ice zone. Due to these high concentrations, it may play an important role in climate control. A DMS monthly climatology for July through October was created employing various ocean characteristics and spatial modeling techniques commonly used for describing species distributions in ecology. Comparisons between observed and predicted values of surface seawater DMS concentrations led to r 2 values of 0.61, 0.87, 0.66, and 0.37 for July, August, September, and October, respectively. Measurement data used for model development for July through October were variably distributed spatially. For October only, data were sparse and clustered, resulting in the poor results obtained for this month. Mean sea ice concentration and surface nitrate concentrations were found to be important predictors of surface seawater DMS concentrations. A negative relationship between sea ice concentration and DMS, and a two-phase relationship between nitrate and DMS were found. The two-phase relationship may be indicative of how DMS concentrations are affected when nitrate is the limiting nutrient. From July to September, predicted DMS concentrations were generally lowest under the sea ice. High monthly DMS concentrations (up to 10.7 nM) were predicted in the seasonal ice zone. The highest DMS concentrations in September (2.6 nM) were predicted along the ice edge. In order to create more accurate climatologies and to increase our understanding of sulfur cycling in the Arctic, a higher spatial and temporal distribution of DMS measurements is required.
1468561|The history of how aspects of biology, geology and chemistry came together over the past three centuries to form a separate discipline known as biogeochemistry is described under four major headings: metabolic aspects, geochemical aspects, biogeochemical cycles, and the origin of life. A brief chronology of major conceptual advances is also presented.
1469590|Profiles of iron speciations (porewater Fe(II) and Fe(III), solid-phase Fe(II) and Fe(III)) have been studied to localize both iron reduction and oxidation in flooded paddy soil. Sulfate and nitrate were determined to analyze interactions of redox reactions involved in the iron cycle with those of the sulfur and nitrogen cycle. The development of the iron(II) and iron(III) profiles was observed in microscale over a time period of 11 weeks. After 11 weeks the profiles were stable and showed lowest concentrations of solid-phase iron(II) on the soil surface with increasing concentrations to a soil depth of 10 mm ( 100  mol/cm<sup>3</sup>). Profiles of iron(III) showed a maximum of iron(III) at a depth of 2 to 4 mm ( 100-200  mol/cm<sup>3</sup>). Porewater iron(II) concentrations were three orders of magnitude lower than extracted iron(II) and indicated that most iron(II) was adsorbed to the solid-phase or immobilized as siderite and vivianite. Diffusive loss of iron from the soil was indicated by iron recovery (0.3  mol gdw<sup>-1</sup>) in the flooding water after 12 weeks. The organic content of the soil influenced the concentrations of solid-phase iron(II) in deeper soil layers (> 6 mm); higher Fe(II) concentrations in soil with limiting amounts of electron donors may indicate lower consumption of CO<sub>2</sub> by methanogenic bacteria and therefore a higher siderite precipitation. Soil planted with rice showed similar iron(II) profiles of fresh paddy soil cores. However, maximal iron(III) concentrations ( 350  mol/cm<sup>3</sup>) were present in planted soil at a depth of 1 to 2.5 mm where oxygen is provided by a mat of fine roots. Sulfate and nitrate concentrations in the porewater were highest on the soil surface (10  M NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, 40  M SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and decreased with depth. Similar profiles were detected for malate, acetate, lactate, and propionate, the concentrations decreased gradually from the surface to a depth of 4 mm. Profiles of oxygen showed highest concentrations at the surface due to photosynthetic production and a depletion of oxygen below 3 mm depth. Methane production rates measured from soil layers incubated separately in closed vessels were zero at the soil surface and increased with depth. In soil depths below 4 mm where iron(III) concentrations decreased higher methane production rates were found.
1469502|Rainfall simulation experiments were performed in areas of semiarid grassland (Bouteloua eriopoda) and arid shrubland (Larrea tridentata) in the Chihuahuan desert of New Mexico. The objective was to compare the runoff of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from these habitats to assess whether losses of soil nutrients are associated with the invasion of grasslands by shrubs. Runoff losses from grass- and shrub-dominated plots were similar, and much less than from bare plots located in the shrubland. Weighted average concentrations of total dissolved N compounds in runoff were greatest in the grassland (1.72 mg/l) and lowest in bare plots in the shrubland (0.55 mg/l). More than half of the N transported in runoff was carried in dissolved organic compounds. In grassland and shrub plots, the total N loss was highly correlated to the total volume of discharge. We estimate that the total annual loss of N in runoff is 0.25 kg/ha/yr in grasslands and 0.43 kg/ha/yr in shrublands -- consistent with the depletion of soil N during desertification of these habitats. Losses of P from both habitats were very small.
1469073| Sediment samples from two locations in the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea) were collected during periods of maximum and minimum temperatures for two years. Both sites were rich in carbonate material and inhabited by a diverse benthic infaunal community. However, Site F exhibited a deeper dwelling faunal community, higher content of carbonate minerals, and larger grained sediments than at site MA, which was closer to shore. Depth profiles of sulfate reduction and potential rates of iron and manganese reduction were determined together with measurements of pore water and solid phase chemistry. Bottom waters at all sites were nearly saturated with oxygen for all of the dates sampled except for September 1993 when bottom waters at site F were less than 50% saturated. Sulfate reduction rates were as high as 400 nmol ml<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> during late summer and fall when temperatures were >20 C, while rates during March (8 C) were <30 nmol ml<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>. Potential rates of iron reduction, as determined by the accumulation of both dissolved and acid-soluble reduced iron, were high in surficial sediments at each site except at site F when bottom waters were partially depleted in oxygen. In the latter instance, sulfate reduction overwhelmed metal reduction. Although the portion of metal reduction due directly to enzymatic use by bacteria was not determined, the potential rate data suggested that Fe and perhaps Mn reduction were significant components of anaerobic carbon degradation in these sediments during much of the year. Both sites appeared to support active metal-reducing bacterial communities. However, occasional depletion of oxygen in bottom waters appeared to cause a decrease in irrigation/reworking activity by infauna which depressed redox cycling of elements enhancing the importance of sulfate reduction. A shift from metal reduction to sulfate reduction potentially exacerbates toxic effects of oxygen depletion on fauna by increasing the accumulation of toxic sulfide. 
1469142| We have investigated the extent of iron oxyhydroxide deposition on the roots of two common freshwater species, Vallisneria americana Michx. and Heteranthera dubia (Jacq.) MacM., collected from different sites in the St. Lawrence River, Qubec, Canada, and have related metal concentrations in the root plaques both to the geochemical conditions prevailing in the host sediments (pH; metal partitioning) and to the metal concentrations within the plant root tissue. Possible effects of root plaque on sediment geochemistry are also discussed. At those sites where the two submerged plants co-existed, the amounts of Fe deposited on their respective root surfaces were positively correlated, indicating that sediment geochemistry (pH; concentration of labile metal) exerted a more important influence on plaque formation than did inter-species differences (root physiology, morphology). Iron and Mn concentrations in the root plaque were positively correlated with each other, and with the readily extractable fractions (F1, F2) of these metals in the adjacent sediments. In contrast, Zn concentrations in the root plaque of V. americana were not related to Zn concentrations in the sediments -- the dominant geochemical process at the root surface is Fe deposition, such that the quantities of Zn deposited on the roots are determined not by Zn geochemistry per se but rather by the amount of Fe deposition. Indeed the Zn/Fe ratios in the root plaque were related to the Zn/Fe ratios in the surrounding sediments (NH<sub>2</sub>OHHCl extract). On a concentration basis (g/g), more Fe, Mn and Zn was found outside the root, in the iron plaque, than inside the root tissues. For all 3 metals, significant relationships were observed between the metal concentrations in the plaque and those inside the roots. For Zn, however, the best statistical relationship was not with [Zn]<sub>plaque</sub>, but rather with the [Zn]/[Fe] ratio in the plaque. It is hypothesized that the Zn/Fe ratio in the root plaque reflects the free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration adjacent to the root surface, and that this in turn affects Zn uptake by the plant root. For a given value of Zn in the sediments or in the root plaque, the Zn content of the root is inversely related to the concentration of Fe oxyhydroxides, implying that Fe plays a protective role in regulating Zn bioavailability. 
40647955|It is well known that microbial-mediated soil respiration, the major source of CO from terrestrial ecosystems, is sensitive to temperature. Here, we hypothesize that some mechanisms, such as acclimation of microbial respiration to temperature and/or regulation by plant fresh inputs of the temperature sensitivity of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), should be taken into account to predict soil respiration correctly. Specifically, two hypotheses were tested: (1) under warm conditions, temperature sensitivity (Q) and basal rates of microbial-mediated soil respiration (Bs, respiration at a given temperature) would be primarily subjected to presence/absence of plant fresh inputs; and (2) under cold conditions, where labile depletion occurred more slowly, microbial-mediated soil respiration could adjust its optimal temperatures to colder temperatures (acclimation), resulting in a net increase of respiration rates for a given temperature (Bs). For this purpose, intact soil cores from an oak savanna ecosystem were incubated with sufficient water supply at two contrasting temperatures (10 and 30C) during 140 days. To study temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, short-term temperature cycles (from 5 to 40C at 8 h steps) were applied periodically to the soils. Our results confirmed both hypotheses. Under warm conditions ANCOVA and likelihood ratio tests confirmed that both Q and Bs decreased significantly during the incubation. Further addition of glucose at the end of the incubation period increased Bs and Q to initial values. The observed decrease in temperature sensitivity (Q) in absence of labile sensitivity of the process increases as quality of the substrate decreases. Our experiment also shows that after 2 months of incubation cold-incubated soils doubled the rates of respiration at cold temperatures causing a strong increase in basal respiration rates (Bs). This suggest that microbial community may have up-regulated their metabolism at cold conditions (cold-acclimation), which also disagrees with most observations to date. The manuscript discusses those two apparent contradictions: the decrease in temperature sensitivity in absence of labile and the increase in microbial-mediated soil respiration rates at cold temperatures. While this is only a case study, the trends observed could open the controversy over the validity of current soil respiration models.
1469351|Nitrogen and phosphorus budgets were developed for four sub-catchments in the Richmond River catchment for two study years. The catchment is used for a variety of farming pursuits including dairying, beef, cropping, fruit, nuts, forestry, and sugar cane. Each sub-catchment varies in hydrology, the proportion of each land use, and the population density which enabled a unique opportunity to study fluxes and storage associated with a variety of environmental factors. Total loadings entering each sub-catchment varied from 12 to 57 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for nitrogen and 0.25 to 6.6 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for phosphorus with little inter-annual variation. Averaged across the whole catchment, nitrogen fixation (47%) dominated the inputs; fertiliser (26%) and rainfall (21%) made up the next largest inputs. Fertiliser inputs dominated the phosphorus budget (65.5%); rainfall and manures making up 13% and 12% respectively. Produce dominated the outputs of both nitrogen and phosphorus from the four sub-catchments being greater than the riverine export. The delivery of nitrogen to catchment streams ranged from <1 to 24% of the total inputs and the delivery of phosphorus to catchment streams ranged from <1 to 39%. Storage of phosphorus in catchment soils varied between -0.32 and 4.46 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. When denitrification and volatilisation were estimated using data from other studies, storage of nitrogen ranged from 1 to 24 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Despite the episodic nature of runoff in the sub-tropical Richmond River catchment, the magnitude of nutrient fluxes and storage appear similar to other catchments of the world which have mixed land use and relatively low catchment nutrient loadings.
1469307|Potential rates of both methane production and methane consumption vary over three orders of magnitude and their distribution is skew. These rates are weakly correlated with ecosystem type, incubation temperature, in situ aeration, latitude, depth and distance to oxic/anoxic interface. Anaerobic carbon mineralisation is a major control of methane production. The large range in anaerobic CH<sub>4</sub>: CO<sub>2</sub> production rates indicate that a large part of the anaerobically mineralised carbon is used for reduction of electron acceptors, and, hence, is not available for methanogenesis. Consequently, cycling of electron acceptors needs to be studied to understand methane production. Methane and oxygen half saturation constants for methane oxidation vary about one order of magnitude. Potential methane oxidation seems to be correlated with methanotrophic biomass. Therefore, variation in potential methane oxidation could be related to site characteristics with a model of methanotrophic biomass.
41490442|In order to separate the effects of reaction from those of transport on vertical porewater concentration profiles of nitrate at an intertidal groundwater seepage site (Ria Formosa, Portugal), a freeboundary solution of an Advection-Dispersion-Reaction (ADR) model was used to describe the shape of NO concentration profiles collected in situ. The model includes three sequential reaction layers, postulated with basis on the local distribution of the benthic organic C:N ratio and major identifiable changes in concentration gradients with depth. The advective nature of the system was used to propose a mass balance simplification to the constitutive equations permitting a free-boundary solution, which in turn allowed prediction of sedimentwater fluxes of NO. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that in similarly advective-dominated environments, both the porewater concentration distribution and the interfacial fluxes are strongly dependant on seepage rate and benthic reactivity. The model fitted the measured profiles with high correlation (usually higher than 90%), and model-derived sedimentwater NO fluxes were in good agreement to fluxes measured in situ with Lee-type seepage meters (0.9948 slope, R = 0.8672, n = 8). Nitrate oxidation and reduction rates extracted from model fits to the data (10 10 mmol m h) agreed with literature values. Because dispersive effects are not included in direct mass balances based on the porewater concentrations, the model presented here increases the accuracy of apparent reaction rate estimates and geochemical zonation at Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) sites. The results establish the importance of sandy sediments as reactive interfaces, able to modulate mass transfer of continental-derived contaminants into coastal ecosystems. We suggest that tools such as the one described here might be used to advantage in preparing further experimental studies to elucidate how benthic reactivity affects nitrate distribution and fluxes in sediments affected by SGD.
1469834|Forest production is strongly nutrient limited throughout the southeastern US. If nutrient limitations constrain plant acquisition of essential resources under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> reductions in the mass or nutrient content of forest canopies could constrain C assimilation from the atmosphere. We tested this idea by quantifying canopy biomass, foliar concentrations of N and P, and the total quantity of N and P in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) canopy subject to 4 years of free-air CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment. We also used N:P ratios to detect N versus P limitation to primary production under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Canopy biomass was significantly higher under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> during the first 4 years of this experiment. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> significantly reduced the concentration of N in loblolly pine foliage (5% relative to ambient CO<sub>2</sub>) but not P. Despite the slight reduction foliage N concentrations, there were significant increases in canopy N and P contents under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Foliar N:P ratios were not altered by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> and were within a range suggesting forest production is N limited not P limited. Despite the clear limitation of NPP by N under ambient and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> at this site, there is no evidence that the mass of N or P in the canopy is declining through the first 4 years of CO<sub>2</sub> fumigation. As a consequence, whole-canopy C assimilation is strongly stimulated by elevated CO<sub>2</sub> making this forest a larger net C sink under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> than under ambient CO<sub>2</sub>. We discuss the potential for future decreases in canopy nutrient content as a result of limited changes in the size of the plant-available pools of N under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.
20456381|The ability of specialist prokaryotes to couple the oxidation of organic compounds to the reduction of Fe(III) is widespread in the subsurface. Here microbial Fe(III) reduction can have a great impact on sediment geochemistry, affecting the minerals in the subsurface, the cycling of organic compounds and the mobility of a wide range of toxic metals and radionuclides. The contamination of the environment with radioactive waste is a major concern worldwide, and this review focuses on the mechanisms by which Fe(III)-reducing bacteria can affect the solubility and mobility of one of the most common radionuclide contaminants in the subsurface, uranium. In addition to discussing how these processes underpin natural biogeochemical cycles, we also discuss how these microbial activities can be harnessed for the bioremediation of uranium-contaminated environments.
41490559|Methane emissions and below ground methane pore water concentrations were determined in an alpine fen at 1,915 m a.s.l. in central Switzerland. The fen represented an acidic (pH 4.54.9), nutrient-poor to mesotrophic habitat dominated by Carex limosa, Carex rostrata, Trichophorum caespitosum and Sphagnum species. From late fall to late spring the fen was snow-covered. Throughout winter the temperatures never dropped below 0C at 5 cm below the vegetation surface. Methane emissions in June, July, August and September were in the range of 125 ( 26)313 (71) mg CH m day with a tendency to decrease along the summer season. Mean methane pore water concentrations at a depth of 2040 cm below the vegetation surface were 526 ( 32) M in June and in the range of 144 ( 10)233 ( 7) M in July, August and September. At a depth of 020 cm the mean methane pore water concentrations dropped back to <20 M with an almost linear decrease between 0 and 15 cm. Oxygen pore water concentrations were close to air saturation in the first few centimeters and dropped back below detection limit at a depth of 20 cm. In July and August the pore water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were in the range of 7.210.1 mg Cl at all depths. The pore water concentrations of acetate, formate and oxalate were in the range of 2.08.2 M at all depths. Methanotrophic and methanogenic communities were quantified using pmoA and mcrA, respectively, as marker genes. The abundances of both communities showed a distinct peak at a depth of 1015 cm below the vegetation surface.

23359712|The global surface seawater dimethylsulphide (DMS) database (http://saga.pmel.noaa.gov/dms/) contains >50,000 data points and is the second largest trace gas database after carbon dioxide. However, there has been relatively little quality control on the data that have been collated to date. Furthermore, the recent development of technologies capable of high frequency (>1 Hz) DMS measurements will have a disproportionate effect on the database in future years. At this juncture, the comparability of analytical techniques, sample handling methodologies and standards are pressing issues that the DMS community needs to address. In October 2010, during the Fifth International Symposium on Biological and Environmental Chemistry of DMS(P) and Related Compounds held in Goa, India, attendees participated in a discussion concerning the current DMS database and its future development. We develop some of the ideas from that session and combine them with available data. From the few inter-comparison exercises that have been conducted we show that variability between existing measurements within the DMS database is likely to be 25%. Tests comparing different DMSPHCl standards demonstrate that a reference calibration standard would be beneficial for the DMS community. Confidence in future data collation would be substantially improved with a comprehensive inter-comparison experiment between new analytical techniques and sampling methodologies (e.g., mass spectrometers with equilibrators attached to a continuous flow of seawater) and more established methods (i.e., filtered samples analysed with purge and trap gas chromatography). We conclude with recommendations for the future expansion of the DMS database and its data quality control.

1469254|The areal distribution of organic C contents,  <sup>13</sup>C values, total N and P and biogenic Si contents in surficial sediments were used to study the distribution, origin and diagenetic transformations of sedimented biogenic debris in the eutrophic subalpine Lake Bled (Slovenia), which for most of the year has an anoxic hypolimnion. The influence of an allochthonous input, restricted to the western basin, was clearly traced by higher organic C and total N and P contents, higher  <sup>13</sup>C values, and higher sedimentation rate in comparison to the eastern basin. The low  <sup>13</sup>C values of sedimentary organic matter in the major part of the lake, lower than the  <sup>13</sup>C values of different types of organic matter, suggest that this sedimentary organic matter is most probably the product of a microbial community and not a residue of primary production. The temporal variation of benthic diffusive fluxes of NH<sub>4</sub>, Si and PO<sub>4</sub>, derived from modelling the pore water profiles, was related to sedimentation of phytoplanktonic blooms, while the PO<sub>4</sub> fluxes were also dependent on changing redox conditions at the sediment-water interface in the period of the winter-spring overturn. The removal of PO<sub>4</sub> in pore waters is probably due to the adsorption of phosphate and precipitation of apatite and vivianite. The budget of C, N and P at the sediment-water interface revealed a high recycling efficiency (>70%), also confirmed by the rather uniform (or only slightly decreasing) vertical profiles of organic C, total N and P in sediment cores and C/N and C/P ratios. The percentage of biogenic Si recycling is low (<10%), suggesting its removal in sediments.
40343600|We examined soil nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification rates, and soil and forest floor properties in one native forest: evergreen broad-leaved forest (EBLF), one secondary shrubs (SS), and three adjacent plantation forests: Chinese fir plantation (CFP), bamboo plantation (BP) and waxberry groves (WG) in Tiantong National Forest Park, Eastern China. All forests showed seasonal dynamics of N mineralization and nitrification rates. Soil N mineralization rate was highest in EBLF (1.6  0.3 mg-N kg yr ) and lowest in CFP (0.4  0.1 mg-N kg yr ). Soil nitrification rate was also highest in EBLF (0.6  0.1 mg-N kg yr ), but lowest in SS (0.02  0.01 mg-N kg yr ) . During forest conversion of EBLF to SS, CFP, BP and WG, soil N mineralization rate (10.7%, 73%, 40.3% and 69.8%, respectively), soil nitrification rate (94.9%, 32.2%, 33.9% and 39%, respectively), and soil N concentration (50%, 65.4%, 78.9% and 51.9%, respectively) declined significantly. Annual soil N mineralization was positively correlated with total C and N concentrations of surface soil and total N concentration of forest floor, and negatively correlated with soil bulk density, soil pH and C: N ratio of forest floor across the five forests. Annual soil nitrification was positively correlated with total C concentration of surface soil and N concentration of forest floor, and negatively correlated with soil bulk density and forest floor mass. In contrast, annual soil nitrification was not correlated to pH value, total N concentration, C: N ratio of surface soil and total C concentration and C: N ratio of forest floor.

20456397|The importance of snowmelt and spring rainfall to water and nutrient exports from macro-scale watersheds (&gt;1000 km) is not well established. Data collected from the Androscoggin River watershed (Maine and New Hampshire) between February 1999 and March 2002 show that the 90-day spring melt period accounted for 39-57% of total annual discharge and is likely driven both by snowpack melting and spring rainfall. While large loads of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) are delivered to the watershed from snowmelt and rain (from 1.16  10 to 1.61  10 kg N over the study years), only one third of this N load is exported from the basin during the snowmelt period (0.40  10-0.48  10 kg N). Despite reduced residence time and temperature limitations on biological N retention, there is a poor mass balance between DIN input to the watershed and the nitrogen exported from mouth of the river. Inferences from a geochemical hydrograph separation suggests that approximately 51-63% of the water leaving the mouth of the Androscoggin river is from these 'new' water sources (rain and snowmelt) while 37-49% is from DIN depleted soil and groundwater. Mixing of water from different sources, as well as nutrient retention by dams in the upper watershed, may account for the large discrepancy between DIN inputs and exports from this watershed.

Respiration rates varied over almost two orders of magnitude (1.003-0.014  g C g<sup>-1</sup> C min<sup>-1</sup>, n=61), and were significantly correlated with wood density (r<sub>adj</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.42), and moisture content (r<sub>adj</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.39). Additional samples taken from a nearby pasture indicated that wood moisture content was the most important factor controlling respiration rates across sites (r<sub>adj</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.65). Based on average coarse litter wood density and moisture content, the mean long-term carbon loss rate due to respiration was estimated to be 0.13 yr<sup>-1</sup> (range of 95% prediction interval (PI) = 0.11-0.15 yr<sup>-1</sup>). Comparing mean respiration rate with mean mass loss (decomposition) rate from a previous study, respiratory emissions to the atmosphere from coarse litter were predicted to be 76% (95% PI = 65-88%) of total carbon loss, or about 1.9 (95% PI = 1.6-2.2) Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Optimum respiration activity corresponded to about 2.5 g H<sub>2</sub>O g<sup>-1</sup> dry wood, and severely restricted respiration to <latex>$<0.5\ \text{g}\ \text{H}_{2}\text{O}\ \text{g}^{-1}$</latex> dry wood. Respiration from coarse litter in central Amazon forests is comparable in magnitude to decomposing fine surface litter (e.g. leaves, twigs) and is an important carbon cycling component when characterizing heterotrophic respiration budgets and net ecosystem exchange (NEE).
41490507|In the Rio Negro basin, podzols develop at the expense of clay-depleted laterites through localized and spectacular weathering fronts. This natural process leads to the remobilization of previously accumulated organic matter (OM) which is redistributed within soil profiles and exported towards rivers, hence their typical black coloration. We investigate the fate of OM in the soil-water continuum in the Rio Negro basin through description of the composition of OM potentially mobile at different stages of podzol development and exploration of evidence for contributions from different soil horizons to the exportation of OM into waters. OM was water-extracted from seven key soil samples from a sequence representative of the transition between latosol and podzol on the low elevation plateaux of the Rio Negro basin, thus enabling following both vertical and lateral differentiations. The chemical structure of freeze-dried samples, investigated using C nuclear magnetic resonance and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM), shows contrasting features depending on the horizon considered. The bulk features of water extracts were first compared with samples collected in the water-tables and rivers draining the soil sequence. A molecular level comparison was then performed with groundwater draining the well-developed podzol. This approach evidenced a contribution from deep horizons of well-developed podzols. It highlights that OM is certainly remobilised after being accumulated in Bh horizons during the development of podzols through accumulation of OM redistributed from surface horizons.The identification of specific compounds opens new perspective to trace a "podzolic origin" of OM in drainage networks.
41490449|Information about the impact of nitrogen (N) deposition on the fate of deposited N in peatland ecosystems is lacking. Thus we investigated the fate of experimentally added N in long-term N-fertilized treatments in a Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bog. Fertilization significantly stimulated vascular plant and suppressed Sphagnum and Polytrichum moss growth. N content in peat, mosses, and vascular plants was raised by the fertilizer addition and reached a maximum at 3.2 g m N input level with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) addition. Most of N was retained in the vegetation and upper 10 cm of the peat. When N deposition equalled 1.6 g m and less, or 3.2 g m N with P and K addition, no inorganic N leaching was observed on the plots. This result indicates that co-fertilization with P and K raised the N retention capacity and that critical N loads with respect to N saturation depend on P and K availability. Most of the deposited N was recovered in the bulk peat, which may be related to a rapid immobilization of inorganic N by microorganisms and mycorrhizal assimilation. Increase of N,P, and plants to N retention significantly and reduced those of mosses. The increase was mainly related to enhanced productivity, vascular biomass and N content in tissues; the reduced retention by mosses resulted from both reduced moss biomass and assimilation. The study shows that the N filter function of ombrotrophic bogs will be influenced by interactions with other nutrients and shifts in plant community structure.
41490433|Here we report on a controlled environment experiment in which we applied C- and N-enrichment approaches to quantify methane oxidation rates and source partition NO production in a silt loam soil following application of NHNO, enabling us to look for potential interactions between methane oxidation and nitrifier-NO production. N-NO, N-NO and CO fluxes and mineral N concentrations were measured over a 23-day period after application of NHNO (5 at.% excess N) at rates of 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 g N m to a silt loam soil. Change in  / C-CH concentrations (as indicative of C-CH oxidation rates) and production of C-CO were monitored over the first 72 h after addition of 1.7 l C-CH l (10 at.% excess C) to these N treatments. Oxidation of applied C-CH was slower in the 5, 10, 20 and 30 g N m (5 at.% excess N) treatments (0.24-0.32 g C-CH l day) than in the control (0.40 g C-CH l day), suggesting that these N loadings inhibited oxidation. NO production was raised after N addition, and in the 10, 20 and 30 g N m treatments nitrification was the predominant source of NO accounting for 61, 83 and 57% of the total N-NO produced, respectively. Our results point towards the possibility of methylotrophs switching function to oxidise ammonia in the presence of N, which may result in greater atmospheric loading of both CH and NO.
1469554| Simulations by global terrestrial biogeochemical models (TBMs) consistently underestimate the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) at high latitude monitoring stations during the nongrowing season. We hypothesized that heterotrophic respiration is underestimated during the nongrowing season primarily because TBMs do not generally consider the insulative effects of snowpack on soil temperature. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared the performance of baseline and modified versions of three TBMs in simulating the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at high latitude CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring stations; the modified version maintained soil temperature at 0 C when modeled snowpack was present. The three TBMs include the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), Century, and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). In comparison with the baseline simulation of each model, the snowpack simulations caused higher releases of CO<sub>2</sub> between November and March and greater uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> between June and August for latitudes north of 30 N. We coupled the monthly estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> exchange, the seasonal carbon dioxide flux fields generated by the HAMOCC3 seasonal ocean carbon cycle model, and fossil fuel source fields derived from standard sources to the three-dimensional atmospheric transport model TM2 forced by observed winds to simulate the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at each of seven high latitude monitoring stations. In comparison to the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations simulated with the baseline fluxes of each TBM, concentrations simulated using the snowpack fluxes are generally in better agreement with observed concentrations between August and March at each of the monitoring stations. Thus, representation of the insulative effects of snowpack in TBMs generally improves simulation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in high latitudes during both the late growing season and nongrowing season. These simulations highlight the global importance of biogeochemical processes during the nongrowing season in estimating carbon balance of ecosystems in northern high and temperate latitudes. 
24715113|Nitrate (NO) is an important form of nitrogen (N) available to plants. The measurements of NO concentration [NO] and isotopes (N and O) in plants provide unique insights into ecosystem NO availability and plant NO dynamics. This work investigated the variability of these parameters in individuals of a broadleaved (Aucuba japonica) plant and a coniferous (Platycladus orientalis) plant, and explored the applicability of tissue NO isotopes for deciphering plant NO utilization mechanisms. The NO in washed leaves showed concentration and isotopic ratios that were much lower than that in unwashed leaves, indicating a low contribution of atmospheric NO to NO in leaves. Current leaves showed higher [NO] and isotopic ratios than mature leaves. Moreover, higher leaf [NO] and isotopic enrichments (relative to soil NO) were found under higher soil NO availability for A. japonica. In contrast, leaves of P. orientalis showed low [NO] and negligible isotopic enrichments despite high soil NO Higher [NO] was found in both fine and coarse roots of the P. orientalis plant, but significant isotopic enrichment was found only in coarse roots. These results reflect that the NO accumulation and isotopic effects decreased with leaf age, but increased with soil NO supply. Leaves are therefore identified as a location of NO reduction for A. japonica, while P. orientalis did not assimilate NO in leaves but in coarse roots. This work provided the first organspecific information on NO isotopes in plant individuals, which will stimulate further studies of NO dynamics in a broader spectrum of plant ecosystems.
41410566|We have studied 15 catchments supplying freshwater to a French Atlantic coastal lagoon, where increase in nitrogen loads due to agriculture is supposed to have destabilized the ecosystem in the last decades. The catchment is a lowland composed of Pleistocene sands with an average slope of 0.25%. To study the nutrient export in relation to land-use surface waters were sampled bi-weekly between October 2006 and January 2009 and land-use was established by plane photographs and Geographic Information System (GIS). Cultivated pine forests represent more than 80% of the total surface and 7% of the catchment area has been deforested recently. Significant areas of some catchments are used for maize crop. Housing is confined to the coastal zone. Maize and forest crop give a robust signature in terms of nitrate export. In view of modeling the nutrient fluxes, we have established the mean export rate for every land-use: forested parcels, deforested parcels, cultivated surfaces, and housing areas export 45,93, 2850, and 61 kg N-nitrate km year, respectively. Exports of ammonium, dissolved organic N (DON), and dissolved inorganic P (DIP) could not be related to land use. The mean export is 13, 100, and 0.57 kg km year for N-ammonium, DON, and DIP, respectively. The modeling of nitrogen flux is in good agreement with our measures for the largest catchment, which supplies about 90% of the total continental DIN flux. However, small catchments are more dynamic due to hydrological conditions and the model is less accurate. This work has permitted to complete and unify scattered studies about nutrient cycling in this area. Thus we have established and compared the nitrogen budget of cornfields and cultivated pine forest. We have emphasized that (i) fertilizer use should be reduced in cornfields because they stock between 200 and 6400 kg DIN km year, and (ii) the nitrogen budget in pine forest mostly depends on tree harvesting and symbiotic N-fixation, which is poorly constrained. Export of N by rivers represents a small contribution to the N budget of soils.
1469105|During 20 years of climatic warming, drought and increased forest fires between 1970 and 1990, DOC concentrations declined by 15-25% in lakes of the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, allowing increased penetration of both UV and photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR), and causing deeper euphotic zones and thermoclines. Decreased input to the lakes of DOC from terrestrial catchments and upstream lakes was the primary reason for the decline, although in-lake removal also increased slightly. Decreased streamflow caused by drought was more important than forest fires in affecting DOC exports from catchments. Experimental acidification of lakes caused even greater losses in DOC, by enhancing rates of in-lake removal. DOC in Lake 302S, acidified to pH 4.5 during the 1980's, declined to less than 10% of preacidification values.
1469229| We report here estimates of the areas of water that are between 1 and 100 m and between 1 and 200 m deep in the North Atlantic, including the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Hudson Bay and the North Sea, but excluding estuaries. The total areas within these depths, from the equator to 70 N, are 3.91  10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> and 5.66  10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. We also report the respective areas by selected geographic regions. 
1468853|The effects of select monoterpenes on nitrogen (N) mineralization and nitrification potentials were determined in four separate laboratory bioassays. The effect of increasing monoterpene addition was an initial reduction in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N production (nitrification inhibition), followed by a reduction in the sum of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N (inhibition of net N mineralization and net immobilization at high monoterpene additions. Monoterpenes could produce this pattern by inhibiting nitrification, reducing net N mineralization, enhancing immobilization of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N relative to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, and/or stimulating overall net immobilization of N by carbon-rich material. Initial monoterpene concentrations in the assay soils were about 5% of the added amount and were below detection after incubation in most samples. Potential N mineralization-immobilization, nitrification, and soil monoterpene concentrations were determined by soil horizon for four collections from a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stand in New Mexico. Concentrations of monoterpenes declined exponentially with soil depth and varied greatly within a horizon. Monoterpene content of the forest floor was not correlated with forest floor biomass. Net N mineralization was inversely correlated with total monoterpene content of all sampled horizons. Nitrification was greatest in the mineral soil, intermediate in the F-H horizon, and never occurred in the L horizon. Nitrification in the mineral soil was inversely correlated with the amount of monoterpenes in the L horizon that contain terminal unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds r<sup>2</sup>=0.37, P 0.01). This pattern in the field corresponded to the pattern shown in the laboratory assays with increasing monoterpene additions.
23359744|Most terrestrial ecosystems support a similar suite of biogeochemical processes largely dependent on the availability of water and labile carbon (C). Here, we explored the biogeochemical potential of soils from Earth's driest ecosystem, the Atacama Desert, characterized by extremely low moisture and organic C. We sampled surface soil horizons from sites ranging from the Atacama's hyper-arid core to less-arid locations at higher elevation that supported sparse vegetation. We performed laboratory incubations and measured fluxes of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) as indices of potential biogeochemical activity across this gradient. We were able to stimulate trace gas production at all sites, and treatment responses often suggested the influence of microbial processes. Sites with extant vegetation had higher C concentrations (0.130.68%) and produced more CO<sub>2</sub> under oxic than sub-oxic conditions, suggesting the presence of aerobic microbial decomposers. In contrast, abiotic CO<sub>2</sub> production appeared to predominate in the most arid and C-poor (<0.08% C) sites without plants, with one notable exception. Soils were either a weak source or sink of CH<sub>4</sub> under oxic conditions, whereas anoxia stimulated CH<sub>4</sub> production across all sites. Several sites were rich in nitrate, and we stimulated N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes in all soils by headspace manipulation or dissolved organic matter addition. Peak N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes in the most C-poor soil (0.02% C) were very high, exceeding 3 ng nitrogen g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> under anoxic conditions. These results provide evidence of resilience of at least some soil biogeochemical capacity to long-term water and C deprivation in the world's driest ecosystem. Atacama soils appear capable of responding biogeochemically to moisture inputs, and could conceivably constitute a regionally-important source of N<sub>2</sub>O under altered rainfall regimes, analogous to other temperate deserts.
40343587|Depending on the balance between sink and source processes for C, drained organic forest soil ecosystems can be in balance or act as net sinks or sources of CO to the atmosphere. In order to study the effect of groundwater level and soil temperature on C-flux, the CoupModel was calibrated (climate data, groundwater levels, soil CO flux, net ecosystem fluxes of CO-exchange, sensible heat flux and latent heat flux, forest production etc.) for a drained forest in Sweden. Bayesian calibration techniques were used to elucidate how different parameters and variables were interlinked in C-circulation. The calibrated model reproduced abiotic and biotic variables reasonably well except for root respiration, which was largely underestimated. Bayesian calibration reduced the uncertainties in the model and highlighted the fact that calibrations should be performed with a high number of parameters instead of specific parameter values.
1469641|We discuss the mechanisms leading to nutrient limitation in tropical marine systems, with particular emphasis on nitrogen cycling in Caribbean ecosystems. We then explore how accelerated nutrient cycling from human activities is affecting these systems. Both nitrogen and phosphorus exert substantial influence on biological productivity and structure of tropical marine ecosystems. Offshore planktonic communities are largely nitrogen limited while nearshore ecosystems are largely phosphorus limited. For phosphorus, the ability of sediment to adsorb and store phosphorus is probably greater for tropical carbonate sediments than for most nearshore sediments in temperate coastal systems. However, the ability of tropical carbonate sediments to take up phosphorus can become saturated as phosphorus loading from human sources increases. The nature of the sediment, the mixing rate between nutrient-laden runoff waters and nutrient-poor oceanic waters and the degree of interaction of these water masses with the sediment will probably control the dynamics of this transition. Nearshore tropical marine ecosystems function differently from their temperate counterparts where coupled nitrification/denitrification serves as an important mechanism for nitrogen depuration. In contrast, nearshore tropical ecosystems are more susceptible to nitrogen loading as depurative capacity of the microbial communities is limited by the fragility of the nitrification link. At the same time, accumulation of organic matter in nearshore carbonate sediments appears to impair their capacity for phosphorus immobilization. In the absence of depurative mechanisms for either phosphorus or nitrogen, limitation for both these nutrients is alleviated and continued nutrient loading fuels the proliferation of nuisance algae.
20055169|We hypothesized that differences in microbial and plant N demand in balsam poplar and white spruce stands would control in situ net N transformation and retention following N additions. Throughout the study, N fertilizer (NHNO) was added in three increments during the growing season, giving an annual N addition of 100 kg
41490464|To test the reliability of the radiocarbon method for determining root age, we analyzed fine roots (originating from the years 19851993) from ingrowth cores with known maximum root age (16 years old). For this purpose, three Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands were selected from boreal forests in Finland. We analyzed root C age by the radiocarbon method and compared it with the abovementioned known maximum fine root age. In general, ages determined by the two methods (root C age and ingrowth core root maximum age) were in agreement with each other for roots of small diameter (<0.5 mm). By contrast, in most of the samples of fine roots of larger diameter (1.52 mm), the C age of root samples of 19871989 exceeded the ingrowth core root maximum age by 1-10 years. This shows that these roots had received a large amount of older stored carbon from unknown sources in addition to atmospheric CO directly from photosynthesis. We conclude that the C signature of fine roots, especially those of larger diameter, may not always be indicative of root age, and that further studies are needed concerning the extent of possible root uptake of older carbon and its residence time in roots.
1469002|Sediment columns from an oligotrophic lake were percolated with artificial pore-water in two 46-day experiments to examine the effects of Littorella uniflora and benthic microalgae on retention of phosphorus (P) by either iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn). Cumulative retention of P, Fe, and Mn was 2-5 times higher in sediment with L. uniflora than in sediment with microalgae, because of higher P uptake and more efficient Fe and Mn oxidation by L. uniflora than by microalgae. Thus 34% and 21% of added P was retained in L. uniflora inhabited sediments as metal-oxide bound P compared to 11% and 2% in microalgae inhabited sediments, in experiments supplied with Fe and Mn, respectively. The atomic ratio of Fe/P precipitation was about 1 and for Mn/P precipitation it was about 5. These ratios indicate precipitation of Fe(III)-phosphate (strengite) and metastable Mn(IV)-compounds containing phosphate and hydroxide ions in variable amounts. In addition to metal-oxide P precipitation, increased P retention in the vegetated sediment was also caused by the presence of humic acid compounds, which accounted for about 26% of total retained P.

41490447|Soluble organic nitrogen (SON) plays a vital role in ecosystem N cycling processes and is controlled by a number of biotic and abiotic factors. We compared soil SON availability, microbial biomass, protease and asparaginase activities and phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) profiles at the 0-15 and 15-30 cm layers in 10 year old tea plantations of two genotypesOolong tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze cv. Huangjingui) (designated as 'OT') and Green tea (C. sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze cv. Fuyun 6) (designated as 'GT') established at different slope positions. Concentrations of soil SON measured by the 2 M KC1 extraction under the plantation were greater than under the GT plantation, while concentrations of soil SON were greater in the middle slope (MS) and lower slope (LS) positions than in the upper slope (US) position. Trends in soil microbial biomass C and N and protease and asparaginase activities between the two genotypes and across the slope positions were similar to the SON pools. The fungalto-bacterial ratios were higher in the US position than in the MS and LS positions and higher under the GT plantation than under the plantation. Results from this study support that the genotype and the slope position are key factors controlling the availability of soil SON in tea plantations and also imply the importance of plant traits (e.g. litter quantity and chemistry) and soil texture in determining overall soil N availability and transformation processes and microbial community composition at the landscape level.
1469314|Conifer needles are an important link in the cycling of Total Mercury (THg) and Methylmercury (MeHg) in the boreal ecosystem due to the high THg and MeHg concentrations in litterfall. Translocation within the tree of Hg from soils to the crown canopy has been assumed to be a minor source of the Hg in litterfall. This paper, however, is the first to present direct observations of THg/MeHg transport from the soil via xylem sap. Xylem sap concentrations of THg and MeHg were measured in sap drained from different levels along the boles of freshly cut 100 year old Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The trees came from a mixed stand growing on podzolized till soils at the Svartberget Forest Research Station in N. Sweden. Soil solution concentrations of THg and MeHg at different levels in the soil profile were measured for comparison. Concentrations of THg in xylem sap ranged from 10-15 ng L<sup>-1</sup> in both the Scots pine and Norway spruce. Concentrations of MeHg varied from 0.03 ng L<sup>-1</sup> to 0.16 ng L<sup>-1</sup>, with higher values in Scots pine than Norway spruce. If these concentrations are representative of the transport from soils to needles in xylem sap at this site, then only 3% of the MeHg in litterfall (0.12 mg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and 11% of the THg (26 mg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) can originate via this pathway. The upward transport via xylem sap is larger relative to the open field inputs (84% of THg and 17% of MeHg). Comparison of soil solution and xylem sap THg/MeHg suggested some degree of THg exclusion during water uptake in Scots pine and Norway spruce, but MeHg exclusion only in Norway spruce.
20519871|This study presents the role of specific terrigenous organic compounds as important vectors of mercury (Hg) transported from watersheds to lakes of the Canadian boreal forest. In order to differentiate the autochthonous from the allochthonous organic matter (OM), lignin derived biomarker signatures [Lambda, S/V, C/V, P/(V + S), 3,5-Bd/V and (Ad/Al)v] were used. Since lignin is exclusively produced by terrigenous plants, this approach can give a non equivocal picture of the watershed inputs to the lakes. Moreover, it allows a characterization of the source of OM and its state of degradation. The water column of six lakes from the Canadian Shield was sampled monthly between June and September 2005. Lake total dissolved Hg concentrations and Lambda were positively correlated, meaning that Hg and ligneous inputs are linked (dissolved OM r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.0001; particulate OM r = 0.76, p &lt; 0.0001). Ratios of P/(V + S) and 3,5-Bd/V from both dissolved OM and particulate OM of the water column suggest an inverse relationship between the progressive state of pedogenesis and maturation of the OM in soil before entering the lake, and the Hg concentrations in the water column. No relation was found between Hg levels in the lakes and the watershed flora composition--angiosperm versus gymnosperm or woody versus non-woody compounds. This study has significant implications for watershed management of ecosystems since limiting fresh terrestrial OM inputs should reduce Hg inputs to the aquatic systems. This is particularly the case for large-scale land-use impacts, such as deforestation, agriculture and urbanization, associated to large quantities of soil OM being transferred to aquatic systems.
1468776|Release and uptake of NO was measured in a slightly alkaline (pH 7.8) and an acidic (pH 4.7) cambisol. In the alkaline soil under aerobic conditions, NO release was stimulated by ammonium and inhibited by nitrapyrin. Nitrate accumulated simultaneously and was also inhibited by nitrapyrin. <sup>15</sup>NO was released after fertilization with <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> but not with NH<sub>4</sub><sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub>. The results indicate that in aerobic alkaline cambisol NO was mainly produced during nitrification of ammonium. The results were different under anaerobic conditions and also in the acidic cambisol. There, NO release was stimulated by nitrate and not by ammonium, and was inhibited by chlorate and not by nitrapyrin indicating that NO production was exclusively due to reduction of nitrate. The results were confirmed by <sup>15</sup>NO being released mainly from NH<sub>4</sub><sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub> rather than from <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>. The observed patterns of NO release were explained by the NO production processes being stimulated by either ammonium or nitrate in the two different soils, whereas the NO consumption processes being only stimulated by nitrate. NO release was larger than N<sub>2</sub>O release, but both were small compared to changes in concentrations of soil ammonium or nitrate.
41410579|Conversion to no-till (NT) is usually associated to increased soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in comparison to inversion tillage (IT). However, an important and unexplained variability in the changes in SOC with NT adoption exists, which impedes accurate prediction of its potential for C sequestration. We performed a meta-analysis with pedo-climatic and crop factors observed to influence SOC storage under NT at local and regional scales, in order to determine those better explaining this variability at a global scale. We studied SOC stocks (0-30 cm) in an equivalent soil mass, climatic and soil characteristics in 92 NT-IT paired cases. A subbase with the 35 pairs providing C inputs was used to test their effect. Greater SOC stocks were observed with NT, with a smaller difference than often described (6.7%, i.e. 3.4 Mg C ha). Crop C inputs differences was the only factor significantly and positively related to SOC stock differences between NT and IT, explaining 30% of their variability. The variability in SOC storage induced by NT conversion seems largely related to the variability of the crop production response. Changes at the agroecosystem level, not only in soil, should be considered when assessing the potential of NT for C sequestration.
25652614|Mountain ecosystems are currently experiencing the strongest climatic warming and the largest changes in land-use during the last millennia. The impacts of these changes on soils and their roles in the cycling of carbon and nutrients are, however, largely unknown. Here, we define mountain soils as soils from mountainous areas with cool summers and cold winters and thus, soils from ecosystems that are influenced by snow and ice and where biogeochemical processes are limited by temperature. Because climatic conditions, soil properties, plant species and productivity vary at a small scale in mountains, they provide a unique natural but a seldom used laboratory to study soil processes. In this special issue, we compile different studies on soils from European mountains, reaching from the functioning of mountain soils along natural climatic gradients to responses of greenhouse gas fluxes from mountain soils to experimental warming, soil frost and changes in precipitation.
1468851|Measurements of net methane flux were made during the 1988 ice-free season (May-October) at a beaver-meadow complex in northern Minnesota, USA. The site included upland boreal forest, sedge meadow, submerged aquatic plants, and the open water of a beaver pond. Annual fluxes were 8-11 g C/m<sup>2</sup> in the permanently wetted zones and 0.2-0.4 g C/m<sup>2</sup> at the occasionally inundated meadow and forest sites. These data, when coupled with long-term (46 yr) data on beaver (Castor canadensis) population size and habitat alteration, suggest that about 1% of the recent rise in atmospheric methane may be attributable to pond creation by beaver in North America.
1469003|Excess N delivered to forest ecosystems has been shown to alter internal ecosystem biogeochemical cycles, contribute to forest decline, and negatively affect the health of receiving waters. In the vicinity of the Nikiski Industrial Complex, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, there has been recent concern about the influence of NH<sub>3</sub> emissions that have occurred for over two decades on local soils and vegetation. The study site represented an opportunity to examine the influence of elevated N deposition on a northern coniferous ecosystem in an area with a low background of N deposition. Overstory vegetation in the area is dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca Moench. Voss) and paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.). Mortality of both species has occurred adjacent (<2 km) to the industrial complex. Average annual N deposition rates ranged from 0.7 to 21.0 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in the area, with the highest rates closest to the complex. Sulfate deposition at the site was low. Due to the high NH<sub>3</sub> deposition, precipitation near the complex was less acidic than precipitation in general; bulk precipitation pH ranged from 5.51 to 7.06. Within 1.80 km of the facility there was an increase in KCl- and resin- extractable soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the O horizon, and a decrease in soil pH compared to soils further from the facility. Spruce near the facility had chlorotic foliage and thinning crowns, higher concentrations of N, but lower foliar Ca and Mg. Foliar Mg levels approached deficiency levels, but foliar Ca was well above reported deficiency levels at all sites. Both Mg:N and Ca:N ratios, however, suggest nutrient imbalances in the high N deposition zone. Canopy death and fertilization by N appear to have encouraged growth of the native bluejoint grass. The presence of elevated NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in O horizon soil extracts, elevated NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in resin bags placed between the O and E horizons, and nutritional imbalances in the foliage suggest that N saturation may be occurring in soils adjacent to the facility.
1468601|The ILWAS model has been enhanced for application to multiple-lake hydrologic basins. This version of the model has been applied to the Big Moose basin, which includes Big Moose Lake and its tributary streams, lakes, and watersheds. The basin, as defined, includes an area of 96 km<sup>2</sup>, with over 20 lakes and ponds, and 70 km of streams. Hydrologic and chemical calibrations have been made using data from seven sampling stations. When total atmospheric sulfur loading to the basin is halved, the model predicts, after four years of simulation, a decreasing sulfate concentration and to a lesser extent a rising alkalinity at Big Moose Lake outlet. At the end of four years, the results show an increase in pH of 0.1 to 0.5 pH units depending upon season.
1469494|We show that the marine algae Mantoniella squamata, Prymnesium parvum, and Amphidinium klebsii take up carbonyl sulfide (COS) from their surrounding medium. Inhibitor studies confirm that this COS uptake is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which was not detectable with conventional methods. As shown for M. squamata, the COS uptake can be dependent on the growth conditions. Furthermore, COS uptake shows a clear positive correlation with the COS concentration in the growth medium. The value of K<sub>1/2</sub> for the COS uptake was estimated to be around 222 mol/m<sup>3</sup>. The COS consumption by the marine algae species investigated was estimated to be negligible compared to the photoproduction and hydrolysis of COS in seawater.
23359722|Volatile infochemicals including climatically relevant dimethylsulphide (DMS) have been suggested to play important roles in the structuring and functioning of marine food webs. Experimenting with complex natural plankton communities or several trophic levels in laboratory microcosms is challenging and, as a result, empirical data confirming the role of DMS in trophic interactions is lacking. Models are a suitable tool to provide insight into such complex interactions. Here we consider a model of the interactions between three trophic levels of plankton: phytoplankton, grazing microzooplankton and predatory mesozooplankton. We show that the inclusion of a grazing-induced DMS production term has a stabilizing effect on the system dynamics under the assumption that DMS acts as an info-chemical and increases the rate of mesozooplankton predation on grazing microzooplankton. We further demonstrate how this feedback between trophic levels can potentially lead to the formation of a phytoplankton bloom. The model provides a suitable framework for further study into the possible role of DMS in the ecology of marine food webs beyond its recognised role as a climate-cooling gas.
40343539|Terrestrial desert ecosystems are strongly structured by the distribution of plants, which concentrate resources and create islands of fertility relative to interplant spaces. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition resulting from urbanization has the potential to change those spatial patterns via resource inputs, resulting in more homogeneous soil resource availability. We sampled soils at 12 desert remnant sites around Phoenix, Arizona along a model-predicted gradient in N deposition to determine the degree to which deposition has altered spatial patterns in soil resource availability and microbial activity. Soil microbial biomass and abundance were not influenced by atmospheric N deposition. Instead, plant islands remained strong organizers of soil microbial processes. These islands of fertility exhibited elevated pools of resources, microbial abundance, and activity relative to interspaces. In both plant islands and interspaces, soil moisture and soil N concentrations predicted microbial biomass and abundance. Following experimental wetting, carbon dioxide (CO) flux from soil of interspaces was positively correlated with N deposition, whereas in plant islands, soil CO flux was positively correlated with soil moisture content and soil organic matter. Soil CO flux in both patch types showed rapid and short-lived responses to precipitation, demonstrating the brief time scales during which soil biota may process deposited materials. Although we observed patterns consistent with N limitation of microbes in interspaces, we conclude that atmospheric N deposition likely accumulates in soils because microbes are primarily limited by water and secondarily by carbon or nitrogen. Soil microbial uptake of atmospherically deposited N likely occurs only during sparse and infrequent rainfall.
1469286|Narragansett Bay is a relatively well-mixed, high salinity coastal embayment and estuary complex in southern New England (USA). Much of the shoreline is urban and the watershed is densely developed. We have combined our data on C, N, and P inputs to this system, on C, N, and P accumulation in the sediments, and on denitrification with extensive work by others to develop approximate annual mass balances for these elements. The results show that primary production within the bay is the major source of organic carbon (4 times greater than other sources), that land drainage and upstream sewage and fertilizer are the major sources of N, and that landward flowing bottom water from offshore may be a major source of dissolved inorganic phosphorus. Most of the nutrients entering the bay arrive in dissolved inorganic form, though DON is a significant component of the N carried by the rivers. About 40% of the DIN in the rivers is in the form of ammonia. Sedimentation rates are low in most of Narragansett Bay, and it appears that less than 20% of the total annual input of each of these elements is retained within the system. A very small amount of C, N, and P is removed in fisheries landings, denitrification in the sediments removes perhaps 10-25% of the N input, and most of the carbon fixed in the system is respired within it. Stoichiometric calculations suggest that some 10-20% of the organic matter formed in the bay is exported to offshore and that Narragansett Bay is an autotrophic system. Most of the N and P that enters the bay is, however, exported to offshore waters in dissolved inorganic form. This assessment of the overall biogeochemical behavior of C, N, and P in the bay is consistent with more rigorously constrained mass balances obtained using large living models or mesocosms of the bay at the Marine Ecosystem Research Laboratory (MERL).
1469162|Intact rich fen soil cores with controlled water levels near the surface were installed in an open greenhouse. To simulate short term summer drought, water levels were lowered (20 cm) after two weeks in half of the cores (experimental cores) and remained near the surface in the other half (blanks). After two more weeks, the water levels were brought back to the surface in the experimental cores and remained there for another two weeks. In the blanks, reduction and alkalinization of the top peat layer occurred. In the experimental soil cores oxidation and acidification started within one week after drawdown. An indication for a drought induced rise in soluble reactive phosphorus has been found. The velocity of the acidification process illustrates the dynamic nature of the hydrochemical conditions in fen soils during drought. The processes controlling the acid/base status of rich fen, the effect of drought induced acidification on P availability and the significance for the vegetation are discussed.
40980873|Terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to atmospheric and climatic changes including increases in atmospheric CO concentration, temperature and alterations of precipitation patterns, which are predicted to continue with consequences for ecosystem services and functioning in the future. In a field scale experiment on temperate heathland, manipulation of precipitation and temperature was performed with retractable curtains, and atmospheric CO concentration was increased by FACE. The combination of elevated CO and warming was expected to affect belowground processes additively, through increased belowground sequestration of labile carbohydrates due to elevated CO in combination with temperature increased process rates. Together, these changes might increase microbial activity and availability of plant nutrients. Two years after the start of the experiment, belowground processes responded significantly to the treatments. In the combined temperature and CO treatment the dissolved organic nitrogen concentration decreased and the ammonium concentration increased, but this release of nutrients was not mirrored by plant parameters. Microbial biomass carbon and microbial enrichment with C and N (1 year after CN-glycine was injected into the soil) increased in warmed plots and in elevated CO plots, but not when these treatments were combined. Furthermore, drought led to an increase in Calluna biomass and total plant nitrogen pool. The full combination of warming, elevated CO and periodic drought did not unambiguously express the ecosystem responses of single factors additively, which complicates predictions of ecosystem responses to multifactor climate change.
41410591|Pristine peatlands have generally low nitrous oxide (NO) emissions but drainage and management practices enhance the microbial processes and associated NO emissions. It is assumed that leaving peat soils from intensive management, such as agriculture, will decrease their NO emissions. In this paper we report how the annual NO emission rates will change when agricultural peat soil is either left abandoned or afforested and also NO emissions from afforested peat extraction sites. In addition, we evaluated a biogeochemical model (DNDC) with a view to explaining GHG emissions from peat soils under different land uses. The abandoned agricultural peat soils had lower mean annual NO emissions (5.5  5.4 kg N ha) than the peat soils in active agricultural use in Finland. Surprisingly, NO emissions from afforested organic agricultural soils (12.8  9.4 kg N ha) were similar to those from organic agricultural soils in active use. These emissions were much higher than those from the forests on nutrient rich peat soils. Abandoned and afforested peat extraction sites emitted more NO, (2.4  2.1 kg N ha), than the areas under active peat extraction (0.7  0.5 kg N ha). Emissions outside the growing season contributed significantly, 40% on an average, to the annual emissions. The DNDC model overestimated NO emission rates during the growing season and indicated no emissions during winter. The differences in the NO emission rates were not associated with the age of the land use change, vegetation characteristics, peat depth or peat bulk density. The highest NO emissions occurred when the soil C:N ratio was below 20 with a significant variability within the measured C:N range (13-27). Low soil pH, high nitrate availability and water table depth (50-70 cm) were also associated with high NO emissions. Mineral soil has been added to most of the soils studied here to improve the fertility and this may have an impact on the NO emissions. We infer from the multi-site dataset presented in this paper that afforestation is not necessarily an efficient way to reduce NO emissions from drained boreal organic fields.
40800600|Peatlands are important contributors of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to downstream aquatic systems. We investigated the effects of storm events on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM quality in a stream draining a Welsh peatland catchment. Intensive stream samples were collected and analysed for pH, DOC, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), absorbance and fluorescence. Soil water samples and samples of sphagnum pore water were also collected, and a simple end-member mixing model was applied to account for changes occurring during the events. Fluorescence data were interpreted using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). DOC concentrations increased and pH decreased during the storm events. The soil water data and the mixing model indicated that this was due to a change of flow paths and draining of the DOC-rich acrotelm. Absorbance indices and the DOC/DON ratio suggested that the DOM released during events was less degraded. There was a striking, inversely related diurnal pattern in absorbance and fluorescence after the discharge peak. The diurnal pattern and a lack of fit with the mixing model suggested that fluorescing DOM was mainly produced in-stream. Fluorescence has been found to peak in the morning and decline during daytime due to photo-bleaching. We hypothesise that the input of additional DOM during events causes a change in the diurnal pattern, giving a peak at mid-day, when the processing of the additional DOM is highest.
24715325|Recent investigations have shown macro-molecules, such as cutins, and suberins as effective markers for above and belowground plant tissues. These biopolyesters contain structural units specific for different litter components and for root biomass. The aim of this work was to understand the fate of plant organic matter (OM) in Mediterranean forest soils by evaluating the incorporation of cutin and suberin by measuring specific biomarkers. Soil and plant tissue (leaves, woods and roots) samples were collected in two mixed Mediterranean forests of Quercus ilex (holm oak) in costal stands in Tuscany (central Italy), which have different ecological and edaphic features. Ester-bound lipids of mineral and organic horizons and the overlying vegetation were analysed using the saponification method in order to depolymerise cutins and suberins and release their specific structural units. Cutin and suberin specific aliphatic monomers were identified and quantified by gas chromatographic techniques. The distribution of cutin and suberin specific monomers in plant tissue suggested that mid-chain hydroxy acids can be used as leaf-specific markers and ,-alkanedioic acids and C18:1 as root-specific markers. Differences in the distributions of biomarkers specific for above and belowground plant-derived OM was observed in the two types of soils, suggesting contrasted degradation, stabilisation and transport mechanisms that may be related to soil physico-chemical properties. The acidic and dry soil appeared to inhibit microbial activity, favouring stabilization of leaf-derived compounds, while, in the more fertile soil, protection within aggregates appeared to better preserve root-derived compounds.
25652608|The frequency of summer flood events has strongly increased in Eastern Europe during the last decades. The creation of water storage areas to avoid flooding is often combined with the recreation of more natural and biodiverse riverine systems. This urges the need to understand the consequences of summer inundation, when microbial activity is significantly higher than during winter inundation, for floodplain biogeochemistry. In order to test the interacting effects of temporal flooding, water quality and agricultural use we used a mesocosm design with sods including vegetation from an area along a tributary of the Vistula River, where water storage compartments have been planned. Concentrations of nitrate and sulphate in the flood water, expected to interfere with soil redox processes, were varied at environmentally relevant concentrations. Inundation led to increased nutrient mobilization in all treatments, particularly for phosphate which reached very high concentrations in both soil water (200300 mol l) and overlaying surface water (2535 mol l) as a result of iron reduction. The response was clearly linked to different soil characteristics like the Olsen P concentration, probably caused by varying kind of land use. Unexpectedly, the flood water quality played a less important role in the response to short-term flooding. This could partly be explained by the relatively low infiltration rate into these waterlogged soils, indicating the importance of local hydrology. The findings of this study are important to understand and predict the effects of (more frequent) summer flooding of Eastern European rivers. It also indicates that it is necessary to take into account the soil quality in assessing the consequences of planned measures on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
20055259|We have used a total of 496 sample sites to calibrate a simple regression model for calculating dissolved inorganic nutrient fluxes via runoff to the ocean. The regression uses the logarithms of runoff and human population as the independent variables and estimates the logarithms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus loading with R values near 0.8. This predictive capability is about the same as has been derived for total nutrient loading with process-based models requiring more detailed information on independent variables. We conclude that population and runoff are robust proxies for the more detailed application, landscape modification, and in-stream processing estimated by more process-based models. The regression model has then been applied to a demonstration data set of 1353 river catchments draining to the sea from the North American continent south of the Canadian border. The geographic extents of these basins were extracted from a 1-km digital elevation model for North America, and both runoff and population were estimated for each basin. Most of the basins (72% of the total) are smaller than 10 km, and both runoff and population density are higher and more variable among small basins than among larger ones. While total load to the ocean can probably be adequately estimated from large systems only, analysis of the geographic distribution of nutrient loading requires consideration of the small basins, which can exhibit significant hydrologic and demographic heterogeneity between systems over their range even within the same geographic region. High-resolution regional and local analysis is necessary for environmental assessment and management.
1469936|Nutrient loss from forest ecosystems by burning and leaching can be estimated by comparing nutrient stores before and after the disturbance, and by measuring the nutrient fluxes during disturbance. We applied both methods to a clear cutting experiment near Belem, Eastern Amazon, in a correct time series of 15 months duration. Nutrient flux measurements include wood export, loss to the atmosphere by burning, and leaching. The latter was based on water flux simulation with a soil water model, and on element analysis of soil water extracts (ceramic cup lysimeter). Two plots with 33 and 92 t ha<sup>-1</sup> of residual biomass (left after export of wood >7 cm diameter) were compared with a forest control plot. Store and flux balances agreed well in case of Na, K, Mg, and S, and partially also for Ca and total P. Deviations seem to be caused by erratic but statistically not significant variations of the soil stores (mainly C and total N). Spacial variability of soil parameters demand very high sample replication, especially after disturbance. Flux measurements are better but more costly.
41410565|In radioisotope studies in plankton, bacteria turn over the nanomolar ambient concentrations of dissolved amino acids within a few hours. Uptake follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In contrast, within minutes the very abundant bacteria and fungi in soil take up all labeled amino acids added at nanomolar to millimolar final concentrations; uptake kinetics accordingly cannot be measured. This rapid uptake agrees with earlier findings that soil microbes exist in a starving or low-activity state but are able to keep their metabolism poised to take up amino acids as they become available. How can this rapid uptake of added amino acids be reconciled with persistent soil concentrations of 10-500 M of total dissolved amino acids? Although respiration of added amino acid carbon has been used to deduce uptake kinetics, the data indicate that in both soil and in eutrophic natural waters constant percentages of individual amino acids are respired; this percentage varies from less than 10% of the amount taken up for basic amino acids to more than 50% for acidic amino acids. We conclude that relatively fixed internal metabolic processes control the percent of amino acid respired and that the M concentrations of amino acid measured in water extracts from soil are unavailable to microbes. Instead, these relatively high concentrations reflect amino acids in soils that are chemically protected, hidden in pores, or released from fine roots and microbes during sample preparation. and that the M concentrations of amino acid measured in water extracts from soil are unavailable to microbes. Instead, these relatively high concentrations reflect amino acids in soils that are chemically protected, hidden in pores, or released from fine roots and microbes during sample preparation.
20519833|Pine litter amended with either tannic acid (TA) or condensed tannins (CTs) was studied to assess the effects on C, N and P mineralization in relation to the fate of tannins by incubation experiments during various time intervals. TA induced a rapid short-term effect resulting in high C respiration and net N and P immobilisation. After one week of incubation, TA was decomposed and net C, N and P mineralization and net nitrification resembled that of the control (non-amended litter). CTs exhibited effects on net mineralization on longer terms, i.e. after several weeks of incubation until the end of the experiment (84 days). While net N and P mineralization were greatly reduced, net nitrification was only slightly affected. Most likely CTs formed complexes with organic N of the substrate thereby reducing net N mineralization, while such complexes were not involved in net nitrification processes. The reduction of net P mineralization is due to the lack of need for P by microbes when they cannot get access to N. The fact that decreasing amounts of extractable CTs were accompanied by increasing effects on mineralization processes with incubation time strongly suggests that CTs were incorporated into the litter in such a way that they were inextricable by the common solvents needed to measure tannins, such as for the Folin-Ciocalteu and HCl-butanol assays.
40343633|Nitrite (NO) is an intermediate in a variety of soil  cycling processes. However, NO dynamics are often not included in studies that explore the  cycle in soil. Within the presented study, nitrite dynamics were investigated in a Nothofagus betuloides forest on an Andisol in southern Chile. We carried out a N tracing study with six N labeling treatments, including combinations of NO, NH and NO. Gross N transformation rates were quantified with a N tracing model in combination with a Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization routine. Our results indicate the occurrence of functional links between (1) NH oxidation, the main process for NO production (nitritation), and NO reduction, and (2) oxidation of soil organic N, the dominant NO production process in this soil, and dissimilatory NO reduction to NH (DNRA). The production of NH via DNRA was approximately ten times higher than direct mineralization from recalcitrant soil organic matter. Moreover, the rate of DNRA was several magnitudes higher than the rate of other NO reducing processes, indicating that DNRA is able to outcompete denitrification, which is most likely not an important process in this ecosystem. These functional links are most likely adaptations of the microbial community to the prevailing pedoclimatic conditions of this Nothofagus ecosystem.
25652617|We investigated the response of soil macroaggregate dynamics to soil temperature modification along a spatial gradient located on a forested north-facing slope in the southern French Alps, simulating long-term adjustment of soilplant interactions to absence or occurrence of soil frost. Soil macroaggregate (>250 m) content of Ah horizons was strongly depleted (72%) in colder plots affected by freeze-thaw events, compared to 96% in warmer and frost-free plots (p < 0.05). A visual assessment of soil macroaggregation showed that physical processes were the main drivers of soil macroaggregation in colder plots, with 66% of the 512.5 mm fraction and the whole 3.155 mm fraction. Conversely, we found a balanced contribution of biological and physical aggregation pathways in warmer plots. All identified macroaggregate types could be classified, depending on their organic matter (OM) quality, using principal component analyses of their near infrared spectra. Such spectral classifications indicated temporal changes in OM quality of macroaggregates, from formation to colonization by fine roots, suggesting ecosystem-specific ontogenic trajectories for soil macroaggregation. Further physico-chemical characterizations of soil macroaggregates and Ah horizons showed that soil organic carbon content in the Ah horizon was constant along the gradient, whereas soil erodibility was reduced in warmer soils, which prevented the occurrence of fragile macroaggregates formed by freeze-thaw events. Our study thus suggests changes in the erodibility of mountain forest soils under changing climate. Soil erodibility could be affected either positively under warmer conditions, or negatively, under increased soil frost.
40343642|The spatial and temporal controls on soil CO production and surface CO efflux have been identified as outstanding gaps in our understanding of carbon cycling. We investigated both across two riparian-hillslope transitions in a subalpine catchment, northern Rocky Mountains, Montana. Riparianhillslope transitions provide ideal locations for investigating the controls on soil CO dynamics due to strong, natural gradients in the factors driving respiration, including soil water content (SWC) and soil temperature. We measured soil air CO concentrations (20 and 50 cm), surface CO efflux, soil temperature, and SWC at eight locations. We investigated (1) how soil CO concentrations differed within and between landscape positions; (2) how the timing of peak soil CO concentrations varied across riparian and hillslope zones; and (3) whether higher soil CO concentrations necessarily resulted in higher efflux (i. e. did surface CO efflux follow patterns of subsurface CO)? Soil CO concentrations were significantly higher in the riparian zones, likely due to higher SWC. The timing of peak soil CO concentrations also differed between riparian and hillslope zones, with highest hillslope concentrations near peak snowmelt and highest riparian concentrations during the late summer and early fall. Surface CO efflux was relatively homogeneous at monthly timescales as a result of different combinations of soil CO production and transport, which led to equifinality in efflux across the transects. However, efflux was 57% higher in the riparian zones when integrated to cumulative growing season efflux, and suggests higher riparian soil CO production.
1469888|We simulate large-scale dynamics of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in three different coastal aquifers on the Mediterranean Sea. We subject these aquifers to a wide range of different groundwater management conditions, leading to widely different net groundwater drainage from land to sea. The resulting SGD at steady-state is quantifiable and predictable by simple linearity in the net land-determined groundwater drainage, defined as total fresh water drainage minus groundwater extraction in the coastal aquifer system. This linearity appears to be general and independent of site-specific, variable and complex details of hydrogeology, aquifer hydraulics, streamlines and salinity transition zones in different coastal systems. Also independently of site-specifics, low SGD implies high seawater content due to seawater intruding into the aquifer and mixing with fresh groundwater within a wide salinity transition zone in the aquifer. Increasing SGD implies decreasing seawater content, decreased mixing between seawater and fresh groundwater and narrowing of the salinity transition zone of brackish groundwater in the aquifer.
20055193|Soil respiration (Rs) was monitored periodically throughout 2001 and 2003 in a pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) stand located in the Belgian Campine region. An empirical model originally developed for a neighboring pine stand, that accounts for variation in temperature, soil moisture, rewetting of the surface layers by rain during dry periods and seasonal fresh litter inputs, was fitted to the data. The model explained 92% and 94% of the temporal variability in Rs during 2001 and 2003 respectively. Monthly measurements of Rs can suffice to build a robust empirical model if temperature is the main controlling factor. However, during the driest period of the year a weekly sampling schedule was needed to capture the combined effect of temperature, soil water content (SWC) and the short-term effect of rewetting played. Although the model was developed for gap-filling purposes it also showed a remarkable predictive ability for this site and these conditions. Annual emissions of carbon (C) estimated with the model were significantly higher in 2001 than in 2003 (7.8 and 5.9 ton C
1469511|Effects of water flow velocity on nitrification, denitrification, and the metabolism of dissolved oxygen and inorganic carbon in macrophyte-epiphyton complexes were investigated in the present study. The metabolic rates were measured in microcosms containing shoots of Potamogeton pectinatus L. with epiphytic biofilms in the light and dark with no flow or with the flow velocities of 0.03 and 9 cm s<sup>-1</sup>. Photosynthesis and respiration increased with increasing water flow velocity. Rates of oxygen respiration were positively correlated to the oxygen concentration of the water. Nitrification was not significantly affected by flow velocity, but nitrification was higher in light than in dark at 0.03 cm s<sup>-1</sup>, but not at 9 cm s<sup>-1</sup>. Denitrification was higher in stagnant water and at 9 cm s<sup>-1</sup> than at 0.03 cm s<sup>-1</sup> in the absence of oxygen, possibly due to complex effects of water flow velocity on the supply of organic matter to the denitrifying bacteria. Denitrification was always inhibited in light, and negatively correlated to the oxygen concentration in dark. Epiphytic denitrification occurred only at low oxygen concentrations in flowing water, whereas in stagnant water, denitrification was present in almost oxygen saturated water. Therefore, because there are little of water movements and high oxygen consumption in dense stands of submersed macrophytes, significant rates of epiphytic denitrification can probably be found within submersed vegetation despite high oxygen concentrations in the surrounding water. In conclusion, this study shows that the water flow and oxygen metabolism within submersed vegetation have minor effects on nitrification, but significantly affect denitrification in biofilms on submersed macrophytes.
20055168|This paper describes detailed budgets of water, Cl, dissolved Si and both inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus for two small glacier basins in Arctic Svalbard (Midre Lovnbreen and AustreBrggerbreen). Rates of nutrient deposition are modest, dominated by inorganic nitrogen and episodically enhanced by extreme events. Hence deposition rates are also variable, ranging from 20 to 72 kg
24715100|Streams draining peatlands export large quantities of carbon in different chemical forms and are an important part of the carbon cycle. Radiocarbon (C) analysis/dating provides unique information on the source and rate that carbon is cycled through ecosystems, as has recently been demonstrated at the airwater interface through analysis of carbon dioxide (CO) lost from peatland streams by evasion (degassing). Peatland streams also have the potential to release large amounts of methane (CH) and, though C analysis of CH emitted by ebullition (bubbling) has been previously reported, diffusive emissions have not. We describe methods that enable the C analysis of CH evaded from peatland streams. Using these methods, we investigated the C age and stable carbon isotope composition of both CH and CO evaded from a small peatland stream draining a temperate raised mire. Methane was aged between 1617 and 1987 years BP, and was much older than CO which had an age range of 303521 years BP. Isotope mass balance modelling of the results indicated that the CO and CH evaded from the stream were derived from different source areas, with most evaded CO originating from younger layers located nearer the peat surface compared to CH. The study demonstrates the insight that can be gained into peatland carbon cycling from a methodological development which enables dual isotope (C and C) analysis of both CH and CO collected at the same time and in the same way.
1468984|Variations in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations of surface waters and subsurface interstitial groundwater of riparian and wetland soils to 1.2 m depth were evaluated in a riverine wetland ecosystem over one year. DOC was monitored at seven sites within the wetland pond, two sites on the inflow stream, and one site on the outflow stream. Surface concentrations in the inflow stream ranged from 0.74 to 11.6 mg C L<sup>-1</sup> and those of the outflow from 2.1 to 8.0 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>. Average DOC from stream floodplain hydrosoils (3.1 to 32.1 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>) was greater than DOC from the sediments below the stream channel (1.6 to 6.8 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>). Surface DOC within the wetland varied seasonally, with greatest fluctuations in concentrations through the summer and autumn (range 4.8 to 32.6 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>) during intensive macrophyte growth and bacterial production. DOC was less variable during the winter months (1.7 to 3.3 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>). Within the wetland pond, average DOC concentrations (7.1 to 48.2 mg C L<sup>-1</sup>) in the subsurface waters were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than average surface concentrations. The microbial availability of surface and subsurface DOC to bacteria was evaluated from losses of DOC by wetland bacteria grown on the DOC. Bacterial growth efficiencies ranged from 5 to 20% and were negatively correlated to the percentage of DOC removed by bacteria (r<sup>2</sup>=0.93). Throughout the ecosystem, DOC concentrations were greatest in the subsurface waters, but at most depths this DOC was a less suitable substrate than surface DOC for utilization by bacteria.
1469513|Whole-cell suspensions of Enterobacter cloacae SLD1a-1 produced dimethylselenide (DMSe) from selenate, selenite, elemental selenium, dimethylselenone, seleno-DL-methionine, 6-selenoinosine, and 6-selenopurine. Cell-free extracts of the bacterium produced the formation of DMSe from organic selenium compounds, including dimethylselenone, dimethylselenoniopropionate, seleno-DL-methionine, seleno-DL-ethionine, and 6-selenoguanosine. The highest rate of DMSe production occurred from whole-cell suspensions and cell-free extracts containing dimethylselenone. DMSe was also produced by cell-free extracts containing selenite or elemental selenium and methylcobalamin. Cell-free extracts did not produce DMSe from inorganic selenium when S-adenosyl-L-methionine was present. Additionally, DL-homocysteine and L-methionine were found to inhibit selenium volatilization. These findings suggest the formation of DMSe from inorganic selenium occurs through the transfer of a methyl group from methylcobalamin.
23359762|Forest biogeochemical cycles are shaped by effects of dominant tree species on soils, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We investigated effects of temperate tree species on interactions among carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and acidity in mineral soils from an experiment with replicated monocultures of 14 tree species. To identify how trees affected these soil properties, we evaluated correlations among species-level characteristics (e.g. nutrient concentrations in leaf litter, wood, and roots), stand-level properties (e.g. nutrient fluxes through leaf litterfall, nutrient pools in stemwood), and components of soil C, N, and cation cycles. Total extractable acidity (acidity<sub>tot</sub>) was correlated positively with mineral soil C stocks (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, P < 0.001), such that a nearly two-fold increase in acidity<sub>tot</sub> was associated with a more than two-fold increase of organic C. We attribute this correlation to effects of tree species on soil acidification and subsequent mineral weathering reactions, which make hydrolyzing cations available for stabilization of soil organic matter. The effects of tree species on soil acidity were better understood by measuring multiple components of soil acidity, including pH, the abundance of hydrolyzing cations in soil solutions and on cation exchange sites, and acidity<sub>tot</sub>. Soil pH and acidity<sub>tot</sub> were correlated with proton-producing components of the soil N cycle (e.g. nitrification), which were positively correlated with species-level variability in fine root N concentrations. Soluble components of soil acidity, such as aluminum in saturated paste extracts, were more strongly related to plant traits associated with calcium cycling, including leaf and root calcium concentrations. Our results suggest conceptual models of plant impacts on soil biogeochemistry should be revised to account for underappreciated plant traits and biogeochemical processes.
1469009| Homoionic Na-, Ca-, and Al-clays were prepared from the <2 m fractions of Georgia kaolinite and Wyoming bentonite and mixed with sand to give artificial soils with 5, and 25% clay. The artificial soils were inoculated with microbes from a natural soil before incubation. Unlabelled and uniformly <sup>13</sup>C-labelled (99.9% atom) glucose were incorporated into the artificial soils to study the effects of clay types, exchangeable cations and clay contents on the mineralization of glucose-carbon and glucose-derived organic materials. Chemical transformation of glucose-carbon upon incorporation into microbial products and metabolites, was followed using solid-state <sup>13</sup>C CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy. There was a significant influence of exchangeable cations on the mineralization of glucose-carbon over a period of 33 days. At 25% clay content, mineralization of glucose-carbon was highest in Ca-soils and lowest in Al-soils. The influence of exchangeable cations on mineralization of glucose-carbon was more pronounced in soils with bentonite clay than those with kaolinite clay. Statistical analysis of data showed no overall effect of clay type on mineralization of glucose-carbon. However, the interactions of clay type with clay content and clay type with clay content and exchangeable cations were highly significant. At 25% clay content, the mineralization of glucose-carbon was significantly lower in Na- and Al-soils with Wyoming bentonite compared with Na- and Al-soils with Georgia kaolinite. For Ca-soils this difference was not significant. Due to the increased osmotic tension induced by the added glucose, mineralization of glucose-carbon was slower in soils with 5% clay than soils with 25% clay. Despite the differences in the chemical and physical characteristics of soils with Ca-, Na- and Al-clays, the chemical composition of organic materials synthesised in these soils were similar in nature. Assuming CP/MAS is quantitative, incorporation of uniformly <sup>13</sup>C-labelled glucose (99.9% atom) in these soils resulted in distribution of carbon in alkyl (24-25%), O-alkyl (56-63%), carbonyl (11-15%) and small amounts of aromatic and olefinic carbon (2-4%). However, as decomposition proceeded, the chemistry of synthesised material showed some changes with time. In the Ca- and Na-soils, the proportions of alkyl and carbonyl carbon decreased and that of O-alkyl carbon increased with time of incubation. However, the opposite trend was found for the Al-soil. Proton-spin relaxation editing (PSRE) subspectra clearly showed heterogeneity within the microbial products. Subspectra of the slowly-relaxing (long T<sub>1</sub> (H)) domains were dominated by alkyl carbon in long- and short-chain structures. The signals due to N-alkyl (55 ppm) and carbonyl carbon were also strong in these subspectra. These subspectra were very similar to those obtained for microbial and fungal materials and were probably microbial tissues attached to clay surfaces by polysaccharide extracellular mucilage. Subspectra of fast-relaxing (short T<sub>1</sub> (H)) domains comprised mostly O-alkyl and carbonyl carbon and were probably microbial metabolites released as neutral and acidic sugars into the extracellular environment, and strongly sorbed by clay surfaces. 
41490434|Trends in precipitation chemistry and hydrologie and climatic data were examined as drivers of long-term changes in the chemical composition of high-elevation lakes in three wilderness areas in Colorado during 19852008. Sulfate concentrations in precipitation decreased at a rate of 0.15 to 0.55 eq/1/year at 10 high-elevation National Atmospheric Deposition Program stations in the state during 19872008 reflecting regional reductions in SO emissions. In lakes where sulfate is primarily derived from atmospheric inputs, sulfate concentrations also decreased although the rates generally were less, ranging from 0.12 to 0.27 eq/1/year. The similarity in timing and sulfur isotopic data support the hypothesis that decreases in atmospheric deposition are driving the response of high-elevation lakes in some areas of the state. By contrast, in lakes where sulfate is derived primarily from watershed weathering sources, sulfate concentrations showed sharp increases during 19852008. Analysis of long-term climate records indicates that annual air temperatures have increased between 0.45 and 0.93C per decade throughout most mountainous areas of Colorado, suggesting climate as a factor. Isotopic data reveal that sulfate in these lakes is largely derived from pyrite, which may indicate climate warming is preferentially affecting the rate of pyrite weathering.
20519788|The Seine River estuary (France) is the receptacle of a drainage basin characterised by high population density, heavy industrial activity and intensive agriculture. Whereas nitrate concentrations are high due to diffuse sources in the upstream drainage basin, ammonium mainly originates from the effluents of the Achres wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) downstream from Paris and its suburbs (6.5 million equivalent-inhabitants). Ammonium is mostly nitrified in the tidal freshwater estuary and nitrification causes a strong summer oxygen deficit. Average longitudinal summer profiles of oxygen and nitrogen concentrations for two periods, between 1993-1997 and 1998-2003 in dry hydrological conditions (excluding the wet years 2000 and 2001) clearly reflect the changes due to the improved treatment of wastewater from Paris and its suburbs. On the basis of daily water flux data and twice monthly nitrogen measurements at the boundaries of the upstream freshwater estuarine section (108 km), we calculated nitrification and denitrification fluxes, whose annual averages were 43 and 71  10 kg N d respectively from 1993 to 2003, with summer values (July-September) representing 73 and 57% of the annual fluxes, respectively. The degree of denitrification in the upper estuary appears to be closely related to the nitrification, itself more loosely related to the amount of reduced nitrogen (Kjeldahl) brought by the treated effluents from the Achres WWTP. We estimated the total NO emissions to about 40 kg N d (25-60 kg N d) in the same sector.
1469027| Sterols were analyzed in suspended particles collected in January 1991 in the Solo River system and in the Serayu River, Java, Indonesia. Free sterols were extracted from particles larger than 0.7 m and analyzed, after derivatization into their trimethylsilyl esters, by GC and GC/MS. Concentrations of total sterols ranged from 438 to 7922 ng/l, or from 2.4 to 183.8 ng/mg of total suspended matter, which varied from 3.3 to 400 and 471 mg/l, respectively in the Serayu River and at the downstream station in the Solo River. POC concentrations also varied in a wide range, from 0.91 to 4.72 and 6.13% of TSM, respectively at the above stations, and were associated with sterol/POC values ranging from 0.15 to 1.75 g/mg. Eleven structures of C<sub>27</sub>, C<sub>28</sub> and C<sub>29</sub> stenols and associated stanols were identified. 28 <sup>5,22</sup> was only found at downstream stations in the Solo River and in the Serayu River. This unique distribution, different from that of other C<sub>27</sub>, C<sub>28</sub> and C<sub>29</sub> sterols, suggests a predominantly autochthonous origin for these compounds associated with an increased planktonic biosynthesis near the estuary. Concentrations of 28 <sup>5</sup>, 29 <sup>5,22</sup> and 29 <sup>5</sup> showed similar spatial distributions and increased downstream, reflecting the significant accumulation of organic matter originating from the vegetation of the various drainage basins. Values of the autochthonous versus terrigenous sterol index, defined as 27 <sup>5</sup>/29 <sup>5,22</sup>+29 <sup>5</sup> were in the 1.4-1.9 range at upstream stations, whereas at downstream stations lower values were found, 0.4-0.6, which also corresponded to higher concentrations of TSM and lower POC values. Insofar as the stanol/stenol values can be used to estimate the bacterial activity of oxic waters, simultaneous variations of C<sub>27</sub> and C<sub>29</sub> stenol/stanol pairs suggest rather different bacterial degradation capacities of autochthonous versus allochthonous organic matter. The wide differencies between the values of the stenol/stanol pairs observed in one of the main tributaries and in downstream stations of the Solo River is evidence that allochthonous organic matter is much more resistant than autochthonous matter. The low index value observed in the Serayu River indicates the highly refractory nature of both autochthonous and allochthonous organic material. 
1468964|Carbon is sequestered in soils by accumulation of recalcitrant organic matter and by bicarbonate weathering of silicate minerals. Carbon fixation by ecosystems helps drive weathering processes in soils and that in turn diverts carbon from annual photosynthesis-soil respiration cycling into the long-term geological carbon cycle. To quantify rates of carbon transfer during soil development in moist temperate grassland and desert scrubland ecosystems, we measured organic and inorganic residues derived from the interaction of soil biota and silicate mineral weathering for twenty-two soil profiles in arkosic sediments of differing ages. In moist temperate grasslands, net annual removal of carbon from the atmosphere by organic carbon accumulation and silicate weathering ranges from about 8.5 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for young soils to 0.7 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for old soils. In desert scrublands, net annual carbon removal is about 0.2 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for young soils and 0.01 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> for old soils. In soils of both ecosystems, organic carbon accumulation exceeds CO<sub>2</sub> removal by weathering, however, as soils age, rates of CO<sub>2</sub> consumption by weathering accounts for greater amounts of carbon sequestration, increasing from 2% to 8% in the grassland soils and from 2% to 40% in the scrubland soils. In soils of desert scrublands, carbonate accumulation far outstrips organic carbon accumulation, but about 90% of this mass is derived from aerosolic sources that do not contribute to long-term sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
1469111|Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and color were measured as a function of time in enclosures and lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area, to calculate their net loss rates. Loss rates in enclosures were first order for both DOC and color, with half-times for loss of 166 and 122 d, respectively. Thus, the colored, light-attenuating component of the DOC pool is lost from water more rapidly than is bulk DOC. Loss rates in lakes, calculated from a steady state model, were similar to values for color in enclosures, but for DOC in lakes were four times slower than in enclosures. In lakes, loss rate for DOC increased rapidly with decreasing water residence time ( <sub>w</sub>) but was independent of  <sub>w</sub> when it was greater than 3 years. In lakes, the loss rate for color was independent of water residence time. The difference in losses of DOC and color between lakes and enclosures could be from release of low-color DOC from sediments.
1469225|Atmospheric chemical models are used to estimate the deposition rate of various inorganic oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub>y</sub>), reduced nitrogen species (NH<sub>x</sub>) and mineral dust to the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO). The estimated deposition of NO<sub>y</sub> to the NAO (excluding the coastal ocean) and the Caribbean is 360 10<sup>9</sup> Moles-N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (5.0 Tg N); this is equivalent to about 13% of the estimated global emission rate (natural and anthropogenic) and a quarter of the emission rate from sources in North America and Europe. In the case of NH<sub>x</sub>, 258 Moles-N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (3.6 Tg N) are deposited to the NAO and the Caribbean; this is about 6% of the global continental emissions. There is relatively little data on the deposition rate of organic nitrogen species; nonetheless, this evidence suggests that concentrations and deposition rates are comparable to those for inorganic nitrogen. Because of anthropogenic emissions, the present-day deposition rate of NO<sub>y</sub> to the NAO is about five times greater than pre-industrial times largely due to emissions from energy production and biomass burning. The present-day emissions of NH<sub>x</sub> from continental anthropogenic sources are about four-to-five times greater than natural sources, mostly due to the impact of emissions from animal wastes associated with food production. Indeed, present-day emissions of NH<sub>x</sub> from animal waste are estimated to be about 10 times greater than the pre-human era. The deposition rate of mineral dust to the NAO is about 170 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup>; deposited with the dust (assuming average crustal abundances) is about 6 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> of Fe and 0.2 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> of P. Dust deposition in the NAO is almost completely attributable to transport from North African sources; a substantial fraction of the dust over the NAO is probably mobilized as a consequence of land use practices in arid regions and, consequently, it should be regarded as a pollutant.

20519779|JGOFS results showed that the ocean is a major sink for the increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide resulting from human activity. However, the role of the coastal seas in the global carbon cycling is poorly understood. In the present work, the inorganic carbon (IC) in the Yangtze River Estuary and Jiaozhou Bay are studied as examples of offshore sediments. Sequential extraction was used to divide inorganic carbon in the sediments into five forms, NaCl form, NHHO form, NaOH form, NHOHHCl form and HCl form. Studied of their content and influencing factors were also showed that NaCl form &lt; NHHO form &lt; NaOH form &lt; NHOHHCl form &lt; HCl form, and that their influencing factors of pH, Eh, Es, water content, organic carbon, organic nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus on inorganic carbon can be divided into two groups, and that every factor has different influence on different form or on the same form in different environment. Different IC form may transform into each other in the early diagenetic process of sediment, but NaCl form, NHHO form, NaOH form and NHOHHCl form may convert to HCl form ultimately. So every IC form has different contribution to carbon cycling. This study showed that the contribution of various form of IC to the carbon cycle is in the order of NaOH form &gt; NHOHHCl form &gt; NHHO form &gt; NaCl form &gt; HCl form, and that the contribution of HCl form contributes little to carbon cycling, HCl form may be one of end-result of atmospheric CO. So Yangtze River estuary sediment may absorb at least about 40.9610 g atmospheric CO every year, which indicated that offshore sediment play an important role in absorbing atmospheric CO.
20519883|We examined the impact of permafrost on dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed (CPCRW), a watershed underlain with discontinuous permafrost, in interior Alaska. We analyzed long term data from watersheds underlain with varying degrees of permafrost, sampled springs and thermokarsts, used fluorescence spectroscopy, and measured the bioavailabity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Permafrost driven patterns in hydrology and vegetation influenced DOM patterns in streams, with the stream draining the high permafrost watershed having higher DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations, higher DOC:-DON and greater specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) than the streams draining the low and medium permafrost watersheds. Streams, springs and thermokarsts exhibited a wide range of DOC and DON concentrations (1.5-37.5 mgC/L and 0.14-1.26 mgN/L, respectively), DOC:DON (7.1-42.8) and SUVA (1.5-4.7 L mgC m). All sites had a high proportion of humic components, a low proportion of protein components, and a low fluorescence index value (1.3-1.4), generally consistent with terrestrially derived DOM. Principal component analysis revealed distinct groups in our fluorescence data determined by diagenetic processing and DOM source. The proportion of bioavailable DOC ranged from 2 to 35%, with the proportion of tyrosine- and tryptophan-like fluorophores in the DOM being a major predictor of DOC loss (p &lt; 0.05, R = 0.99). Our results indicate that the degradation of permafrost in CPCRW will result in a decrease in DOC and DON concentrations, a decline in DOC:DON, and a reduction in SUVA, possibly accompanied by a change in the proportion of bioavailable DOC.
20456584|Fungi are capable of both nitrification and denitrification and dominate the microbial biomass in many soils. Recent work suggests that fungal rather than bacterial pathways dominate N transformation in desert soils. We evaluated this hypothesis by comparing the contributions of bacteria and fungi to NO production at control and N fertilized sites within a semiarid grassland in central New Mexico (USA). Soil samples were taken from the rhizosphere of blue grama (B. gracilus) and the microbiotic crusts that grow in open areas between the bunch grasses. Soils incubated at 30% or 70% water holding capacity, were exposed to one of three biocide treatments (control, cycloheximide or streptomycin). After 48 h, NO and CO production were quantified along with the activities of several extracellular enzymes. NO production from N fertilized soils was higher than that of control soils (165 vs. 41 pmol h g), was higher for crust soil than for rhizosphere soil (108 vs. 97 pmol h g), and increased with soil water content (146 vs. 60 pmol h g). On average, fungicide (cycloheximide) addition reduced NO production by 85% while increasing CO production by 69%; bactericide (streptomycin) reduced NO by 53% with mixed effects on CO production. NO production was significantly correlated with C and N mineralization potential as measured by assays for glycosidic and proteolytic enzymes, and with extractable nitrate and ammonium. Our data indicate that fungal nitrifier denitrification and bacterial autotrophic nitrification dominate N transformation in this ecosystem and that NO production is highly sensitive to soil cover, N deposition and moisture.
1469382|We modeled nutrient export in the Choptank River Basin on the coastal plain of the Chesapeake drainage, using a modified version of a lumped-parameter, hydrochemical model (GWLF). Calibration was performed using long-term (WY1980-WY1990) hydrochemistry data from a gauged site. The calibrated model reproduced water yields, TN, and TP export with cumulative errors of <1% over the 11-year calibration period and with annual RMS errors of 10-50%. Model validation was done with independent measurements at the same gauged site (WY1991 to WY1996) and at another nearby independently gauged site (WY1991 to WY1995). Local adjustment of the groundwater recession coefficient and the dissolved N concentration in agricultural stormflow was essential for successful application at the second site. GWLF appears to be a useful model for estimation of fluxes of water, N and P from ungauged areas with accuracies of 10-50% at annual time scales.
1469058|In order to evaluate the sources of DOC in a subalpine bog, we compare the lignin and carbohydrate compositions of aquatic fulvic acid isolated from the bog (BogW-FA) with the fulvic acids isolated from water leachates of two local plants, sedge (sedgeL-FA) and willow leaves (willowL-FA), and of the peat in the bog (peatL-FA). The bogW-FA and peatL-FA have similar biomarker compositions and both differ significantly from either of the fulvic acids from the water leachate of the plants. Thus, the biomarker data strongly suggest that the peat, and not fresh leaffall, provides most of the aquatic fulvic acid to the bog at this time of year (Fall). However, additional sources of lignin- and carbohydrate-depleted fulvic acid to the bog are also needed to quantitatively match the relatively low levels of recognizable biochemicals in the aquatic fulvic acid from the bog. The unusual lignin compositions of both plant leachates suggest that nonstructural lignin phenol producing components, such as lignans, are part of the water-extractable component of plants. These extractable plant products could potentially contribute to aquatic fulvic acids in other environments or at different times of the year.
41410550|Spatial patterns of planktonic production and respiration in the surface mixed layer were examined in eight Texas, USA reservoirs to test the hypothesis that P:R ratios are lowest in upreservoir inflow zones and highest in downreservoir open-water zones, as predicted by the heuristic reservoir zonation model. We measured summer planktonic metabolism with light-dark bottles and physical-chemical conditions in epilimnetic water at 85 sites distributed among sixteen longitudinal transects within the eight reservoirs (2 transects per reservoir). Volumetric production and plankton biomass were lowest in the open-water zones and increased upreservoir; however, that pattern was reversed for areal production due to greater photic depths at open-water sites. Volumetric respiration was similar in the three zones; however, corresponding planktonic P:R ratios in the surface mixed layer were significantly lower at open-water sites, which is opposite than hypothesized. Based on linear regressions of production and respiration rates on chlorophyll a, open-water sites were net heterotrophic during the summer regardless of trophic state; whereas inflow and mid-reservoir zone sites were heterotrophic when chlorophyll concentrations were respectively less than 9.5 and 35 mg m. Although variation among reservoirs was high, five of the eight reservoirs had inflow zones that were net carbon sinks while seven had open-water zones that were carbon sources. Mean ( standard error) carbon flux rates of inflow, midreservoir, and open-water zones were  0.22  0.12 (C sink), 0.39  0.44 (moderate C source), and 1.33  0.50 (strong C source) g C m day respectively. Inflow and mid-reservoir zones comprised approximately 45% of the total reservoir area studied. Therefore, omitting their contribution as often done when a single open-water site is sampled may substantially overestimate reservoir carbon flux.
20055316|Fires may greatly alter the N budget of a plant community. During fire nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere. Although high light availability after fire promotes N-fixation, the presumably high soil N availability could limit N-fixation activity. The latter limitation might be particularly acute in legume seedlings compared with resprouts, which have immediate access to belowground stored carbon. We wished to learn whether early post-fire conditions were conductive to N-fixation in leguminous seedlings and resprouts in two types of grassland and in a shrubland and whether seedlings and resprouts incurred different amounts of N-fixation after fire. We set 18 experimental fire in early autumn on 6 plots, subsequently labelling 6 subplots (2  2 m) in each community with
1469112|Studies of fluctuations in total organic carbon (TOC) were performed in both the reference basin and the acidified basin of experimental Lake Skjervatjern, in order to separate effects of various catchment and in-lake processes. Nearly five years of catchment acidification did not induce significant changes in TOC. TOC concentrations was not related clearly to precipitation or runoff. In both basins, there was a regular, seasonal pattern with a gradual increase in TOC concentrations from spring to late autumn. Minima in concentrations occurred during periods with frozen ground in winter, irrespective of discharge patterns. The decrease from  10 mg C l<sup>-1</sup> in autumn to 1-2 mg C l<sup>-1</sup> in late winter, was only seen in surface layers. Runoff was the major loss route for surface TOC in the lake. Photo-oxidation, bacterial oxidation, and sedimentation combined yielded maximum loss rates of 3% of surface TOC d<sup>-1</sup>. Below a depth of 1 m 0.5% d<sup>-1</sup> was lost to these same processes. The surface microlayer had 5-10 times more TOC than the bulk water on average, and could have effects on gas exchange and sub-surface light. Despite the oxidation of TOC, the short residence time of the lake and rapid replacement of TOC from the catchment was the major determinant of lake water TOC.
1468665|Nitrogen dynamics were followed in several decomposing forest foliage litters in two contrasting ecosystem types. Litter types showing a significant net accumulation before a net release started were subjected to a study on nitrogen release mechanisms. In all cases no net release of nitrogen took place until a decomposition of the recalcitrant lignin fraction had started. The use of lignin as a predictor for the onset of a net nitrogen release was found to be better than the C/N ratio.
20055265|Anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment alters decomposition processes that control the flux of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from soil organic matter (SOM) pools.

1469467| Inputs, outputs, and pool sizes of total mercury (Hg) were measured in a forested 10 ha watershed consisting of a 7 ha hardwood-dominated upland surrounding a 3 ha conifer-dominated peatland. Hydrologic inputs via throughfall and stemflow, 130.4 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> over the entire watershed, were about double precipitation inputs in the open and were significantly higher in the peatland than in the upland (19.6 vs. 9.8 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Inputs of Hg via litterfall were 12.30.7 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, not different in the peatland and upland (11.7 vs. 12.5 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Hydrologic outputs via streamflow were 2.80.3 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and the contribution from the peatland was higher despite its smaller area. The sum of Hg inputs were less than that in the overstory trees, 333 g m<sup>-2</sup> above-ground, and much less than either that in the upland soil, 5250520 g m<sup>-2</sup>, or in the peat, 3900100 g m<sup>-2</sup> in the upper 50 cm. The annual flux of Hg measured in streamflow and the calculated annual accumulation in the peatland are consistent with values reported by others. A sink for Hg of about 20 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> apparently exists in the upland, and could be due to either or both storage in the soil or volatilization. 
1469337|This paper is centered on the specific effects of plants on the soil weathering environment; we attempt to address how to quantify this component of the ecosystem and assess feedbacks between plants and weathering processes that influence the degree and rates of mineral weathering. The basic processes whereby plants directly influence the soil chemical environment is through the generation of weathering agents, biocycling of cations, and the production of biogenic minerals. Plants may indirectly influence soil processes through the alteration of regional hydrology and local soil hydrologic regime which determines the residence time of water available for weathering. We provide a brief review of the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of plants on mineral weathering and critical knowledge gaps are highlighted. We summarize approaches that may be used to help quantify the effects of plants on soil weathering such as state factor analyses, mass balance approaches, laboratory batch experiments and isotopic techniques. We assess the changes in the soil chemical environment along a tropical bioclimatic gradient and identify the possible effects of plant production on the soil mineralogical composition. We demonstrate that plants are important in the transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the mineral weathering cycle and speculate how this may be related to ecosystem properties such as NPP. In the soils of Hawaiian rainforests subjected to deforestation, pasture grasses appear to change the proportion of non crystalline to crystalline minerals by altering the soil hydrologic regime or partitioning silica into more stable biogenic forms. A better understanding of the relationship between soil weathering processes and ecosystem productivity will assist in the construction predictive models capable of evaluating the sensitivity of biogeochemical cycles to perturbations.
41410575|Respiratory rates on the U.S. southeastern continental shelf have been estimated several times by different investigators, most recently by Jiang et al. (Biogeochemistry 98: 101-113,2010) who report lower mean rates than were found in earlier work and attribute the differences to analytical error in all methods used in earlier studies. The differences are, instead, attributable to the differences in the geographical scope of the studies. The lower estimates of regional organic carbon flux of Jiang et al. (Biogeochemistry 98: 101-113,2010) are a consequence of their extrapolation of data from a small portion of the shelf to the entire South Atlantic Bight.

40980891|This study compares the spatial and temporal variability of water colour for fifteen subcatchments of the River Nidd, northeast England, in 1986 and 2006/2007. Between 1986 and 2006/2007, mean annual water colour increased in all the subcatchments. However, there was considerable variation in the increase, which ranged from 22 to 155%. Statistical analysis revealed that the sub-catchments could be split into two 'types' based on water chemistry and therefore dominant source of runoff; type 1 where flow was dominated by runoff from peat and type 2 where a greater contribution of flow appears to originate from mineral soil horizons, as indicated by the higher silicon, base cation concentrations and pH values. Largest proportional increases in water colour were observed in the sub-catchments that had the smaller mean annual water colour values in 1986 which were, in general, the type 2 subcatchments. The higher rate of water colour increase in the type 2 catchments, in comparison to the type 1 catchments, may be related to changes in adsorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) within the mineral horizons of the organo-mineral soils on the lower catchment slopes possibly as a result of changes in acid sulphur deposition.
1468821|Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured in precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, and soil, peat and stream water in a 50 ha catchment with a central 5 ha swamp at Mont St. Hilaire, Quebec. DOC concentrations in precipitation were low (2.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup>), but increased in passage through the tree canopies as throughfall (9.1-14.6 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and stemflow (23.1-30.1 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). For the period July 1-November 15, 1987, 0.5 g DOC m<sup>-2</sup> was imported as precipitation, and forest canopies contributed a further 1.4-1.7 g m<sup>-2</sup> to the soil surface. DOC concentrations were higher (46.0 and 67.6 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) in upland soil organic horizons, but decreased with depth because subsoil mineral horizons acted as a major sink of DOC. A laboratory experiment using leaf leachate revealed that subsoil horizons were able to adsorb DOC, with equilibrium DOC concentrations ranging from 3 to 19 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. Soil organic carbon appeared to be an important determinant of equilibrium DOC concentrations. The swamp was a major source of DOC, with an overall average DOC concentration of 58.6 mg L<sup>-1</sup> and showed strong spatial and temporal variations related to hydrologic and thermal regimes. During base flow periods, stream DOC concentrations were small (<latex>$<3\ \text{mg L}^{-1}$</latex>), dominated by water fed from springs draining upland soils. During high flows, stream DOC concentrations increased through the contribution of DOC-rich water originating in the swamp. Sources, sinks and transport of DOC are thus a function of a complex set of inter-related biotic and abiotic process.
1468596|The distribution of fish species in the North Branch of the Moose River (Lake Rondaxe to headwaters of Big Moose Lake) was determined by intensive netting and electrofishing surveys of lakes and streams in the watershed during 1982-83. A chronology of changes in fish species occurrence in the drainage system was reconstructed from earlier published surveys conducted in 1882 and 1931 and unpublished survey data obtained by the NYSDEC during the period 1948-1975. Native species present in 1882 were also collected in 1931. Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) were introduced in the early 1900's and were present in collections made in 1931. Major changes in the fish community have taken place since 1931. The smallmouth bass and many of the native species found in the earlier surveys were either absent or restricted in occurrence to downstream sites (eg. L. Rondaxe and Moss L. sub-drainage) in 1982. Non-native species introduced after 1931 (yellow perch, Perca flavescens; central mudminnow, Umbra limi; banded killifish, Fundulus diaphanus) are currently widely distributed throughout the drainage system. In particular, the yellow perch is now a dominant species in the larger lakes of the basin. Comparisons of survival rates for caged fish transferred from high to low pH sites in the Big Moose drainage system demonstrated relatively greater acid tolerance of non-native species (yellow perch, mudminnow, killifish) than native cyprinids. Watershed acidity gradients (pH and aluminum concentrations) and relative physiological acid tolerance are major determinants of currently observed fish species distribution patterns in the North Branch of the Moose River. Differences in age and size structure of fish populations inhabiting acidic and non-acidic lakes of the drainage system were apparent, but difficult to interpret without additional information on population size and potential density dependent parameters such as age specific growth and survival rates. Differential hatching success was observed for yellow perch eggs reciprocally transferred between acid (Big Moose) and neutral (Moss L.) lakes. Eggs transferred from Moss L. to Big Moose L. exhibited poor hatching success as a result of alterations in egg membrane structure that inhibited normal egg expansion and the hatching process. This effect was not evident in eggs from the same parents reared in Moss Lake nor in eggs from the Big Moose parents reared in both lakes. These experimental observations suggested possible genetic adaptation to acid stress by the yellow perch population inhabiting Big Moose Lake.
20456382|Abies pinsapo fir forests are remnant of temperate-like coniferous forests currently subjected to the typical seasonal constraints of Mediterranean-type climates. We have examined for the first time, P availability and cycling in A. pinsapo forests from southern Spain by using both, measurements of concentrations of soil P fractions (resin extractable P, bicarbonate extractable P and NaOH extractable P) and rates of P supply to (P solubilization, P mineralization and phosphomonoesterases (PMEase activity) and P immobilization from the soil solution. Soils from A. pinsapo stands differing in lithology (serpentinitic and calcareous substrates) and successional status (from young-agradative to old-growth stages) were chosen for this study. Labile organic P fractions, PMEase activity and rates of P gross mineralization and immobilization were significantly higher in agradative stands on serpentines than in successionally comparable calcareous stands. This suggests an important role of the organic P subcycle in the A. pinsapo stand on serpentine. On calcareous lithology, PMEase activity and all soil P transformation rates significantly increased throughout the successional series. Similarly, all organic and inorganic P fractions measured in old-growth forests showed the maximum values of the series. These trends fit the predictions of standard patterns of P cycling changes along with succession, in which P supply to plants greatly depends on solubilization from mineral forms at early-to-mid successional stages, whereas the importance of processes related to the organic P subcycle increases as succession progresses.
1468816|In a boreal forest catchment in the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, wildfire caused an increase in the concentrations of strong acid anions and base cations of the stream. In the naturally base-poor Northwest (NW) Subbasin, a 1980 wildfire caused exports of strong acid anions to increase more than export of base cations, causing a 2.5 fold increase in the acidity of the stream. Mean annual stream pH declined from 5.15 prior to fire to 4.76 two years after fire. Acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC), calculated as the difference between total base cations and strong acid anions, decreased to 20% of pre-fire values. Sulfate and chloride were the strong acid anions responsible for the decline in ANC, increasing four-fold. While nitrate increased eleven-fold, concentrations were too low to significantly affect ANC. There was a significant correlation between weekly sulfate concentration and base cation concentration (r<sup>2</sup>=0.83) in the two years after fire. Recovery of ANC was caused by the more rapid decline in concentration of sulfate than by changes in base cations. Drought produced a similar but weaker response than fire, with increased sulfate concentrations and decreased stream pH. Climatic warming that increases drought and fire frequency would have effects that mimic the impacts of acidic precipitation (i.e. higher sulfate concentrations and acidic stream waters). Areas which have higher concentrations of stored S from past acid precipitation or have large areas of peatlands in the watershed may have aggravated losses of S and H<sup>+</sup> after drought and fire.
1469589|We have studied the inhibiting effect of fertilisation and soil compaction on CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation by measuring gas fluxes and soil mineral N dynamics in the field, and CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rates in laboratory-incubated soil samples. The fertilisation and soil compaction field experiment was established in 1985, and the gas fluxes were measured from 1992 to 1994. Methane oxidation was consistently lower in fertilised than in unfertilised soil, but there apparently was no effect of repeated fertiliser additions on the fertilised plots. The measured mineral N in fertilised and unfertilised soil showed large differences in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations just after fertilisation, but the levels rapidly converged because of plant uptake and nitrification. The CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rate did not reflect these contrasting mineral N patterns, suggesting that the CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation capacity remaining in the soil that had been fertilised since 1985 was largely insensitive to ammonia in the new fertiliser. Thus, competitive inhibition by ammonia may have been involved in the early stage of the field fertiliser experiment, but the CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation remaining after 7 to 9 years of continued fertilisation seems not to have been affected by ammonia. The substrate affinity of the CH<sub>4</sub>-oxidizing microflora appeared to be the same in both the fertilised soil and the unfertilised control, as judged from the response to elevated CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations (52  l l<sup>-1</sup>) in laboratory incubations. Soil compaction resulted in a persistent reduction of CH<sub>4</sub> influx, also seen in laboratory incubations with sieved (4-mm mesh) soil samples. Since the sieving presumably removes diffusion barriers created by the soil compaction, the fact that compaction effects persisted through the sieving may indicate that soil compaction has affected the biological potential for CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in the soil.
1469164|Walker and Syers (1976) proposed a conceptual model that describes the pattern and regulation of soil nutrient pools and availability during long-term soil and ecosystem development. Their model implies that plant production generally should be limited by N on young soils and by P on old soils; N and P supply should more or less equilibrate on intermediate-aged soils. We tested the application of this model to nutrient limitation, using a well characterized substrate age sequence in Hawaiian montane rain forest. Earlier experiments had evaluated nutrient limitation in forests on a young (300 y) and an old (4,100,000 y) substrate on the same developmental sequence; N alone limited tree growth on the young substrate, while P alone did so on the old one. An additional fertilizer experiment based on replicated treatments with N, P, and all other nutrients combined, applied in individually and in all factorial combinations, was established in an intermediate-aged site in the Laupahoehoe Forest Reserve, Hawaii. Here, diameter increments of the dominant tree Metrosideros polymorpha increased slightly with N additions, and nearly doubled when N and P were added together. Additions of elements other than N and P had no significant effect on growth. These results show that N and P had equilibrated (relative to plant requirements) in the intermediate aged site. Together with the earlier experiments, these results suggest that the Walker and Syers model provides a useful starting point for explaining the nature and distribution of nutrient limitation in forest ecosystems.
1469696|Since the Changjiang River, Huanghe River and Zhujiang River are the three major rivers in China that are flowing into the Pacific Ocean, this paper addresses nitrogen budgeting, source (input) and sink (output and storage), in these three river valleys, and the China watershed as well. In the China watershed, the anthropogenic reactive N has far exceeded the terrestrial bio-fixed N in nature, and human activities have significantly altered the N cycling in this region. In 1995, the total amount of anthropogenic reactive N in China reached 31.2 Tg with 22.2 Tg coming from synthetic fertilizers and 4.18 Tg from NO<sub>x</sub> emission from fossil fuel combustion, and the input of recycling N amounted to 30.5 Tg, consisting mainly of human and animal excrement N, reflecting the intensity of the human activity. The sink of N includes N in the harvested crop, denitrification and storage in agricultural soils, transportation into waterbodies and volatilization of NH<sub>3</sub>. N output and storage in soil reached up to 48-53 Tg. Of this amount, 14 Tg was in the harvested crops, 12 Tg stored in agricultural soils, 11 Tg transported into waterbodies, 5 - 10 Tg denitrified in the soils and a limited amount exported through food/feed. In this paper - besides the N budget in the China watershed - the N budgets and especially N transports into waterbodies in the Changjiang, Huanghe and Zhujiang river valleys are estimated.
40343595|The effect of phytodetritus derived from Phaeocystis sp. bloom on benthic mineralization processes has been determined at four intertidal stations along the French coast of the eastern English Channel. Sites were chosen to offer a diversity of sediment types, from permeable sandy beach to estuarine mudflats. Sediment Oxygen Demand (SOD) as well as total fluxes of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) at the sediment-water interface were determined by using whole core incubation technique and diffusive fluxes were predicted from interstitial water concentrations. In the absence of phytodetritus deposits, a marked gradient of granulometric characteristics and organic matter contents were observed, and resulted in more intensive mineralization processes in muddy sediments. Highly significant correlations (P < 0.05) were evidenced between SOD and porosity, bacterial biomass, Organic Carbon and Organic Nitrogen, evidencing the direct link between sediment texture, organic matter accumulation and microbial activity. The spring bloom led to a massive input of organic matter in surficial sediments and mineralization rates significantly increased while higher DIN release towards the water column was observed. A modification of the mineralization pathways was evidenced but clearly depended on the sediment type. With a global view, benthic mineralization processes in the intertidal zone provided significant a part of DIN inputs in the coastal zone while water column was depleted in nutrients.
1469873| In the present study, the pyritization of trace metals was studied in 12 soils from 3 salt marshes in the Ra of Ortigueira (NW Spain). The concentrations of trace metals in the pyrite fraction were related to physicochemical conditions, physiographical position in the salt marsh, and the presence or absence and type of vegetation. Redox conditions in soils from the low-salt marsh and from the creek bottom were strongly reducing throughout the profile, and there were higher concentrations of Fe and some trace metals (Cu and Mn) in the pyrite fraction (soluble in HNO<sub>3</sub>) than in the reactive fraction (soluble in 1N HCl). In contrast, the trace-metal content in pyrite fraction in the surface layers of the high-salt marsh was low. In some of the soils, there was a significant increase in the pyrite content below 25 cm, and levels of Fe, Mn and Cu incorporated into this fraction were similar to those in the reactive fraction. The degree of pyritization varied greatly among metals in the order: Cu  Fe-1N HCl>dithionite-Fe>Ni  Mn>>Zn>Cr, although when we considered only the amorphous forms (ascorbate-Fe) as reactive-Fe, the order was: ascorbate-Fe>>Cu>Ni  Mn>>Zn>Cr. These differences appeared to be a consequence of the different geochemical behaviour of each metal (mainly in terms of the thermodynamic stability of sulfides and reaction kinetics), except for Zn. The low concentrations of Zn obtained may have been due to the solubility of ZnS in 1N HCl, which meant that it was extracted with the reactive fraction. Finally, we observed a direct relationship between DOP and DTMP, which was independent of the geochemical behaviour of each metal and of its concentration in the soil. Thus, the strong correlation between pyrite-Fe and the metals associated with this fraction appears to indicate that these metals coprecipitate with pyrite rather than form metal sulfides. 
1469521|The aim of this study was to correlate magnitude and controls of CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes with the microtopography and the vegetation in a hollow-ridge complex of a raised bog. High CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates were measured from hollows and mud-bottom hollows, while hummocks consumed atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> at a low rate. The highest emissions were measured from plots with Eriophorum vaginatum and Scheuchzeria palustris. CH<sub>4</sub> emission ceased after Scheuchzeria had been clipped below the water table, indicating the importance of this aerenchymatic plant as a conduit for CH<sub>4</sub>. Peat in the upper catotelm of hollows was younger and less decomposed than in hummocks. Potential CH<sub>4</sub> production in vitro was higher and the methanogenic association was better adapted to higher temperatures in hollow than in hummock peat. Higher temperatures in hollows resulted in a stronger CH<sub>4</sub> source in hollows than in hummocks. Negative fluxes from hummocks indicated that even in wetlands methanotrophic bacteria exist that are able to oxidize CH<sub>4</sub> at atmospheric mixing ratios, and that oxidation controls CH<sub>4</sub> emission completely. The CH<sub>4</sub> mixing ratio was low in the acrotelm, but it increased within the catotelm. Comparing fluxes measured in static chambers with fluxes calculated from the pore-water CH<sub>4</sub> profiles it was deduced that the zone of methane oxidation was located close to the water table. In hollows, CH<sub>4</sub> production at in situ temperature was far higher than emission into the atmosphere, corresponding to an oxidation rate of nearly 99%. The CH<sub>4</sub> flux between the catotelm and the acrotelm of hollows was also higher than the emission, indicating the importance of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in the aerobic acrotelm, too. CH<sub>4</sub> microprofiles showed that CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in mud-bottom hollows was confined to the topmost 2 mm, and that in Sphagnum-covered hollows CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation occurred at the lower edge of green Sphagnum-parts.
1468533|Chemical analysis of Na, K, Ca and Mg in bulk deposition, using 230 events, showed that variations in atmospheric deposition are explained better by measured concentration than by precipitation amount. In addition, measured concentration is related to precipitation by a significant power function with the exponent near -1. These observations led us to propose an inverse linear model which makes it possible to calculate two parameters: one of them is indicative of the mean composition of "cloud rain" and is assumed to be typical for the study area; the other parameter is representative of particulates, aerosols and gases that are washed out from the atmosphere in the initial phases of precipitation, including dry deposition. This initial component represents an average of 64% of the bulk deposition for the cations studied. The functions that explain the relations between atmospheric deposition and measured concentration are, within statistical limits, equal for the four cations.
41490459|The ocean-atmosphere flux of carbon dioxide in subantarctic surface water (SASW) east of New Zealand has been determined using data from bi-monthly cruises on a time series transect for 8 years. The 60 km long transect extends from the coast (45.770S 170.720E) to a station at 45.833S 171.500E. Sea surface temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations and pCO have been measured at a frequency of about once every 2 months from January 1998 until December 2005. Measured pCO exhibits a seasonal cycle with a maximum in late winter/spring, and a minimum in late summer/autumn, a mean 356 atm, and an amplitude of 9 atm. The magnitude of pCO (the air-sea concentration gradient) has increased over the 8 years, primarily due to the increase in atmospheric CO concentration. The air-sea flux of CO was determined from wind speed data and pCO. The uptake of atmospheric CO by SASW in the study area changed from + 1 and +82 mmol m in 1998 and 1999 respectively (ocean as source) to 870 and  510 mmol m in 2004 and 2005 (ocean as sink). These values are substantially less in magnitude than the value obtained from the Takahashi et al. (Deep-Sea Res II, 2009) flux climatology.
1469057|Nitrous oxide production was measured in intact cores taken from active pasture and old-growth forest Inceptisols in the Atlantic Lowlands of Costa Rica. Following additions of aqueous KNO<sub>3</sub> or glucose, or the two combined amendments, the cores were incubated in the laboratory to determine if N<sub>2</sub>O production rates were either N-limited or C-limited in the two land use types. Differences in rates of denitrification (N<sub>2</sub>O+N<sub>2</sub> production) among amended forest and pasture soils were determined by addition of 10% C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. The forest soils were relatively insensitive to all amendment additions, including the acetylene block. Forest N<sub>2</sub>O production rates among the treatments did not differ from the controls, and were consistently lower than those of the pasture soils. With the addition of glucose plus nitrate to the forest soils, production of N<sub>2</sub>O was three times greater than the controls, although this increase was not statistically significant. On the other hand, the pasture soils were definitely nitrogen-limited since N<sub>2</sub>O production rates were increased substantially beyond controls by all the amendments which contained nitrate, despite the very low N level (5 mg N kg<sup>-1</sup> soil) relative to typical fertilizer applications. With respect to the nitrate plus glucose plus acetylene treatment, denitrification was high in the pasture soils; N<sub>2</sub>O production in the presence of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> was 150% of the rate of N<sub>2</sub>O production measured in the absence of the acetylene block. The results are discussed in relation to the effects of agricultural land use practices and subsequent impacts of disturbance on N<sub>2</sub>O release.
1468888|Phosphorus and nitrogen mass balances of five wetlands (two beaver ponds, two conifer-Sphagnum swamps and one sedge fen) situated in three catchments in central Ontario, Canada, were measured. Monthly and annual input-output budgets of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), total organic nitrogen (TON), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), ammonium ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were estimated for the five wetlands during the 1982-83 and 1983-84 water years. Except for the deepest beaver pond (3.2 m) which had annual TP retention of -44% (-0.030 0.015 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), the wetlands retained <latex>$<0.001\ \text{to}\ 0.015\ \text{g m}^{-2}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$</latex>; however, this was less than 20% of the inputs and the estimated budget uncertainties were equal to or greater than the retention rates. Annual TN retentions ranged from -0.44 to 0.56 g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (-12 to 4%) but were not significantly different from zero. The wetlands transformed nitrogen by retaining TIN (16 to 80% RT) and exporting an equivalent amount as TON (- 7 to 102% RT). The beaver ponds, however, retained NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> while NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> was passed through or the outputs exceeded the inputs. In contrast, the conifer swamps retained both NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. DOC fluxes into and out of the beaver ponds were equal (- 18 and 4% RT) but output from the conifer swamps exceeded input by > 90%. Marked seasonal trends in nutrient retention were observed. Nutrient retention coincided with low stream flow, increased evapotranspiration and biotic uptake during the summer. Net nutrient export occurred during the winter and spring when stream flows were highest and biotic uptake was low.
20055292|Reservoirs are intrinsically linked to the rivers that feed them, creating a river--reservoir continuum in which water and sediment inputs are a function of the surrounding watershed land use. We examined the spatial and temporal variability of sediment denitrification rates by sampling longitudinally along an agriculturally influenced river--reservoir continuum monthly for 13 months. Sediment denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 63 g NO g ash free dry mass of sediments
24715134|This article addresses spatial variability in soil nutrients in altitudinal and latitudinal foresttundra ecotones in the Kola Peninsula, Russia. Higher total carbon, nitrogen, and bio-available nutrients were found in the organic horizons of latitudinal ecotone against the background of lower nutrients in soil-forming rock. This is supposedly related to higher contribution of nutrient-rich plants in latitudinal ecotone and intense downward within-profile matter migration in the altitudinal ecotone. Elevated bioavailable soil nutrients in spruce forests compared with birch forests and tundra sites, and in birch forests compared with tundra against the background of different trends in the soil-forming rock were attributed to the effects of predominant plants. The effects of predominant plants on soil nutrients were distinctly pronounced at the level of site patches. Soil-forming rock effects on soil nutrients were clear at the level of zones/belts and the whole ecotones. Strong negative correlations between the soil nutrients and altitudes were explained by replacement of vascular plants by low-ash lichens at higher elevations.
20456446|Low molecular weight organic carbon compounds are potentially important carbon and energy substrates to heterotrophic production in the aquatic environment. We studied the occurrence of dissolved free amino acids (AA), monosaccharides (CHO), and carboxylic acids (CA) in the subarctic Lake Diktar-Erik. The lake is unproductive with slightly humic water, and receives water via one major inlet stream draining a birch forest environment. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the inlet stream was strongly correlated with the discharge. This relationship changed from season to season, indicating changes in the sources of the DOC entering the stream. AA and CHO each accounted for an average of less than 0.5% of the DOC. After high discharge events during the ice-free period, AA and CHO occurred in especially high concentrations. CA occurred in higher concentrations during the ice-free period, when it generally accounted for 20-30% of the DOC pool. The CA content relative to the total DOC pool was strongly inversely correlated with overall DOC concentration, and at low DOC levels the relative content of CA was high and vice versa. This followed a seasonal trend, with CA accounting for a smaller proportion of the DOC in winter and a larger part in spring/early summer. A conservative estimate suggested that the studied simple organic carbon compounds potentially could cover 30% of the bacterial gross production in the lake and therefore potentially also was an important source of CO that occur in supersaturated concentrations in the lake.
1469550|Soil respiration is the primary path by which CO<sub>2</sub> fixed by land plants returns to the atmosphere. Estimated at approximately 75 10<sup>15</sup> gC/yr, this large natural flux is likely to increase due to changes in the Earth's condition. The objective of this paper is to provide a brief scientific review for policymakers who are concerned that changes in soil respiration may contribute to the rise in CO<sub>2</sub> in Earth's atmosphere. Rising concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere will increase the flux of CO<sub>2</sub> from soils, while simultaneously leaving a greater store of carbon in the soil. Traditional tillage cultivation and rising temperature increase the flux of CO<sub>2</sub> from soils without increasing the stock of soil organic matter. Increasing deposition of nitrogen from the atmosphere may lead to the sequestration of carbon in vegetation and soils. The response of the land biosphere to simultaneous changes in all of these factors is unknown, but a large increase in the soil carbon pool seems unlikely to moderate the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during the next century.
20456536|The Oder and the Vistula rivers are responsible for about 25% of the total riverine nitrogen input to the Baltic Sea and of this 60% have been estimated to originate from diffuse sources. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that changes in agricultural practices in Poland have changed the riverine nitrogen export from the rivers Oder and Vistula to the Baltic Sea. We calculated agricultural long-term nitrogen budgets (1960-2000) for the catchments of the Oder and the Vistula rivers. Poland went through severe economical changes in the early 1990s, which led to a drastic decrease in fertilizer consumption. The role of the calculated nitrogen surplus as an eutrophication capacitor and the potential to reduce this important capacitor to improve the environmental state of the Baltic Sea is discussed. N surplus for the entire country showed a maximum in 1980 (58 kg ha sown area) and it dropped to 39 kg ha sown area in 2000. The surplus was, however, up to two times lower than that in other transitional countries, and much lower than in Western Europe with intensive agriculture. An observed decrease in nitrogen concentrations in both Polish rivers is not ascribed to drop in fertilizer use, but it results from nutrient removal in municipal wastewater treatment plants with tertiary treatment facilities. Comparison of trends in nitrogen concentrations in different transition countries indicates that factors other than reduced fertilizer application influenced the inertia of the water quality response. Hence, the potential to reduce diffuse nitrogen emissions from agriculture by reducing fertilization is constricted in areas with low-nitrogen surplus. In transitional countries like Poland the largest potential for nutrient reductions seem to be in improving the connectivity to waste water treatment plants with tertiary treatment.
24715337|In sediments emerging on the scarp of Lower Orinoco River, Venezuela, we have discovered and studied large (0.5 m) features formed by a plinthite nucleus surrounded by evenly spaced concentric spheroidal structures of iron oxides separated by depletion zones. These features are located in sediments subjected to the mean annual river fluctuation (approx. 14 m) and hence are submerged for several months each year. To the best of our knowledge, structures like these have never been reported or studied. The nuclei and concentric ring formations found in the Orinoco sediments represent an extreme case of regular currently alternating redox conditions. Here we show that the concentric ferric rings surrounding the nuclei could be the result of repeated cycles of diffusion of ferrous ions during flood and subsequent precipitation as ferric oxide during the dry period, thus reflecting the seasonal fluctuation in river level. Our results are consistent with a simple proposed model of ferrous iron diffusion/oxidation according to the flood/dry intervals imposed by river dynamics. This paper is a contribution toward understanding these redoximorphic features (RFs) by: (1) describing their composition and mineralogy; (2) suggesting a possible mode of their formation using the switch to reducing conditions and diffusion of soluble Fe during flood, and its subsequent oxidation and hence immobilization and partial crystallization once exposed to the air; (3) by confirming how this theoretical approach fits the actual pattern of river hydrology in Orinoco, both under average conditions, and as modified by climatic extreme conditions influenced by the El Nio/La Nia Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affecting the ratio of flood/emergence.
40343635|Although soil carbon dioxide (CO) efflux from tropical forests may play an important role in global carbon (C) balance, our knowledge of the fluctuations and factors controlling soil CO efflux in the Asian tropics is still poor. This study characterizes the temporal and spatial variability in soil CO efflux in relation to temperature/moisture content and estimates annual efflux from the forest floor in an aseasonal intact tropical rainforest in Sarawak, Malaysia. Soil CO efflux varied widely in space; the range of variation averaged 17.4 mol m s in total. While most CO flux rates were under 10 mol m s, exceptionally high fluxes were observed sporadically at several sampling points. Semivariogram analysis revealed little spatial dependence in soil CO efflux. Temperature explained nearly half of the spatial heterogeneity, but the effect varied with time. Seasonal variation in CO efflux had no fixed pattern, but was significantly correlated with soil moisture content. The correlation coefficient with soil moisture content (SMC) at 30 and 60 cm depth was higher than at 10 cm depths. The annual soil CO efflux, estimated from the relationship between CO efflux and SMC at 30 cm depth, was 165 mol m year (1,986 g C m year). As this area is known to suffer severe drought every 4-5 years caused by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the results suggest that an unpredictable dry period might affect soil CO efflux, leading an annual variation in soil C balance.
24715110|The Okavango River, in semi-arid north-western Botswana, flows for over 400 km in a pristine wetland developed on a large (>22,000 km) alluvial fan (Okavango Delta). An annual flood pulse inundates the floodplains of the wetlands and travels across the Delta in 46 months. In this study, we assess the effects of long hydraulic residence time, variable hydrologic interaction between riverfloodplainwetland and evapotranspiration on carbon cycling. We measured dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and stable carbon isotopes of DIC (CDIC) from river water when the Delta was not flooded (low water) and during flooding (high water). During low water, the average DIC concentration was 31 % higher and the CDIC 2.1  more enriched compared to high water. In the lower Delta with seasonally flooded wetlands, the average DIC concentration increased by 70 % during low water and by 331 % during high water compared to the Panhandle with permanently flooded wetlands. The increasing DIC concentration downriver is mostly due to evapoconcentration from transpiration and evaporation with increased transit time. The average CDIC between low and high water decreased by 3.7  in the permanently flooded reaches compared to an increase of 1.6  in the seasonally flooded reaches. The lower CDIC during high water in the permanently flooded reaches suggest that DIC influx from the floodplain-wetland affects river's DIC cycling. In contrast, higher river channel elevations relative to the wetlands along seasonal flooded reaches limit hydrologic interaction and DIC cycling occurs mostly by water column processes and river-atmospheric exchange. We conclude that river-wetlands interaction and evapoconcentration are important factors controlling carbon cycling in the Okavango Delta.
20519856|We measured annual net nitrogen (N) mineralization, nitrification, and amino acid production in situ across a primary successional sequence in interior Alaska, USA. Net N mineralization per gram dry soil increased across the successional sequence, but with a sharp decline in the oldest stage (black spruce). Net N mineralization expressed per gram soil organic matter exhibited the opposite pattern, suggesting that soil organic matter quality decreases significantly across succession. Net N mineralization rates during the growing season from green-up (early May) through freeze-up (late September-early October) accounted for approximately 60% of the annual inorganic N flux, whereas the remaining N was released during the apparent dormant season. Nitrogen release during winter occurred primarily during October-January with only negligible N mineralization during early spring in stands of willow, alder, balsam poplar and white spruce. By contrast, black spruce stands exhibited substantial mineralization after snow melt during early spring. The high rates of N mineralization in late autumn through early winter coincide with high turnover of fine root biomass in these stands, suggesting that labile substrate production, rather than temperature, is a major controlling factor over N release in these ecosystems. We suggest that the convention of restricting measurements of soil processes to the growing season greatly underestimate annual flux rates of inorganic nitrogen in these high-latitude ecosystems.
1468845| When ferrous iron and sulfur were supplied, cells of T. ferrooxidans in a well-aerated medium started growth by oxidizing ferrous iron. After ferrous iron depletion a lagphase followed before sulfur oxidation started. During sulfur oxidation at pH-values below 1.3 (0,2) the ferrous iron concentration increased again, although the oxygen saturation of the medium amounted to more than 95%. The number of viable cells did not increase. Thus resting cells of T. ferrooxidans, which are oxidizing sulfur to maintain their proton balance, reduce ferric to ferrous iron. The ferrous iron-oxidizing system seemed to be inhibited at pH-values below 1.3. At a pH-value of 1.8 the ferrous iron was reoxidized at once. A scheme for the linkage of iron- and sulfur metabolism is discussed. 
1468913|Although catchments have been implicated as an important source of metals to lakes, the catchment contribution of different metals is poorly known, and the anthropogenic contribution is not known at all. We determine the anthropogenic lake sediment burdens of Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, and Pb for several Quebec and Ontario lakes, not subject to point source loading, to obtain estimates of atmospheric loading and inputs from terrestrial sources. To do this, we first collected multiple cores across 11 lake basins to estimate the whole-lake Pb burdens. As the whole-lake Pb burdens did not differ among lakes that spanned over two orders of magnitude in drainage ratios (drainage basin area/lake area), we conclude that catchment retention of anthropogenic Pb is complete. The anthropogenic Pb burdens were then used as a correction for focusing for the other metals. Among the metals, Cr and Ni were the most readily exported from drainage basins, followed by Cu. Zn showed no increase with drainage ratio, indicating Zn to be effectively retained by catchments. The export coefficients of the Pb corrected metals correlate well with ocean residence time, revealing a similar metal sorption/precipitation sequence in both soils and oceans. Sediment metal burdens provide a relatively easy way to obtain not only metal export coefficients from drainage basins, but also the atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic metals (e.g. Pb: S.E. Quebec, 950 mg<sup>*</sup>m<sup>-2</sup>: Laurentians, north of Montreal, 420 mg<sup>*</sup>m<sup>-2</sup>). The export coefficients are not only simpler to obtain than by mass balance measurements, but, in addition, identify the anthropogenic component.
1469904| The pCO<sub>2</sub> distribution in the surface waters of the Elbe estuary and German Bight was investigated during high river discharge in April 1997. pCO<sub>2</sub> values of about 1100 atm found in the upper part of the estuary are, compared to other European rivers, only moderate. In the outer estuary, the enhanced river discharge creates a pronounced river plume reflected in decreased surface salinity. However, pCO<sub>2</sub> in this area (250 atm) is below atmospheric values due to primary production. Comparison with results we obtained during other measuring campaigns show that in the outer estuary supersaturation of CO<sub>2</sub> with respect to the atmosphere occurs only in early spring during the time of highest river discharge. In late spring and summer, intensive primary production within the surface layer leads to a pronounced undersaturation (141 atm), despite a temperature increase of more than 20 C from winter to summer. Undersaturation is enforced by stable stratification of the water column during the productive seasons that diminishes the entrainment of CO<sub>2</sub> from below the thermocline into the surface water. In winter, CO<sub>2</sub> is close to equilibrium with the atmosphere and controlled by physical processes. Our data suggest that the Elbe estuary represents a sink for atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> over the investigated seasons and that carbon cycling in this area is dominated by biological processes. 
20519826|Recent national assessments document that nitrogen-driven coastal eutrophication is widespread and increasing in the United States. This significant coastal pollution problem includes impacts including increased areas and severity of hypoxic and anoxic waters; alteration of food webs; degradation and loss of sea grass beds, kelp beds and coral reefs; loss of biodiversity; and increased incidences and duration of harmful algal blooms. In this paper, we review two complementary approaches to assessing the causes and consequences of these trends, as well as potential remedies for them. The first is a national-scale assessment, drawn primarily from expert knowledge of those most familiar with the individual estuaries and integrated into a common analysis framework. The second approach, focused on the Mississippi/Atchafalaya basin -- the largest US drainage basin -- draws upon both quantitative and qualitative analyses within a comprehensive framework, Integrated Assessment.
1469427|The ability to predict the effects of climate change on trace gas fluxes requires a knowledge of microbial temperature responses. However, the response of a microbial community to temperature in a given substrate may be complicated by its thermal history. To examine the effect of sequentially changing temperature on methane and carbon dioxide production in different peat types, we incubated anaerobic peat samples from 3 types of northern peatlands, a bog, a sedge fen and a cedar swamp, in both rising and falling temperature regimes. Graphic and statistical comparisons of the different temperature regimes suggest hysteresis in microbial response to temperature, although the absolute rates at any given temperature often did not differ. Where regressions for temperature response (Arrhenius plots) were significant, they generally differed between temperature regimes. The greatest differences among treatments occurred during the first half of the 40-d incubation. Increases in carbon dioxide production were similar across all peat types, but methanogenesis varied widely: methane production was uniformly low in the bog peat but increased sharply with temperature in the other two peat types. The complicating effect of history or chronology on substrate responses to environmental stimuli may restrain our ability to model the responses of complex systems to changing conditions.
1469370|Hawaiian montane ecosystems developing on recent tephra deposits contain more fixed nitrogen than conventional sources can explain. Heath and Huebert (1999) demonstrated that cloud water interception is the mechanism by which this extra nitrogen is deposited, but could not identify its source. We show here that atmospheric dinitrogen is fixed at the surface of active lava flows, producing concentrations of NO which are higher than those found in most urban rush hour air pollution. Over a period of hours this NO is blown away from the island and oxidized to nitrate. Interruptions in the trade wind flow can return this nitrate to the island to be deposited in cloud water. Thus, fixation on active lava flows is able to provide nitrogen to developing ecosystems on flows emplaced earlier.
1469486| Recent work in seasonally snow covered ecosystems has identified thawed soil and high levels of heterotrophic activity throughout the winter under consistent snow cover. We performed measurements during the winter of 1994 to determine how the depth and timing of seasonal snow cover affect soil microbial populations, surface water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> loss during snowmelt, and plant N availability early in the growing season. Soil under early accumulating, consistent snow cover remained thawed during most of the winter and both microbial biomass and soil inorganic N pools gradually increased under the snowpack. At the initiation of snowmelt, microbial biomass N pools increased from 3.0 to 5.9 g N m<sup>-2</sup>, concurrent with a decrease in soil inorganic N pools. During the latter stages of snowmelt, microbial biomass N pools decreased sharply without a concurrent increase in inorganic N pools or significant leaching losses. In contrast, soil under inconsistent snow cover remained frozen during most of the winter. During snowmelt, microbial biomass initially increased from 1.7 to 3.1 g N m<sup>-2</sup> and then decreased as sites became snow-free. In contrast to smaller pool sizes, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> export during snowmelt from the inconsistent snow cover sites of 1.14 (0.511) g N m<sup>-2</sup> was significantly greater (p < 0.001) than the 0.27 (0.16) g N m<sup>-2</sup> exported from sites with consistent snow cover. These data suggest that microbial biomass in consistently snow-covered soil provides a significant buffer limiting the export of inorganic N to surface water during snowmelt. However, this buffer is very sensitive to changes in snowpack regime. Therefore, interannual variability in the timing and depth of snowpack accumulation may explain the year to year variability in inorganic N concentrations in surface water these ecosystems. 
1468595| Surface water acidification is potentially a problem in regions with low ionic strength drainage waters. Atmospheric deposition of sulfuric acid has generally been implicated as the causative agent of this problem, although other sources of acidity may contribute. The Adirondack region of New York State is an area with "acid-sensitive" surface waters and an abundance of acidic lakes. The intent of this study was to evaluate the processes regulating the acid/base chemistry of a series of lakes draining a large heterogeneous watershed in the Adirondack region of New York. The study site, the North Branch of the Moose River, is heterogeneous in its soil and geological characteristics. This variability was reflected through differences in water chemistry that occurred within the basin. The northern headwaters generally drain subcatchments with shallow, acidic soils. The resulting water chemistry was acidic (equivalence of acidic anions exceeded equivalence of basic cations) with high concentrations of Al and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). As this water migrated through a large lake (Big Moose Lake) with a moderate hydrologic retention time (0.5 yr), considerable loss of DOC was evident. As acidic water was transported through the drainage area, it mixed with waters that were enriched in concentrations of basic cations from the eastern subbasins. As a result, there was a successive increase in the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and a decrease in Al concentrations as water migrated from the northern reaches to the outlet of the watershed. In addition to these general trends, short-term changes in water chemistry were evident. During low flow summer periods concentrations of basic cations were elevated, while concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were relatively low. These conditions resulted in less acidic waters (higher ANC) with relatively low concentrations of Al. During high flow winter/spring conditions, elevated concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were evident, while concentrations of basic cations were reduced resulting in low pH (low ANC) waters with high concentrations of Al. Variability in the processes regulating the pH buffering of waters was apparent through these short-term changes in water chemistry. In the northern subbasin short-term fluctuations in ANC were minimal because of the buffering of Al under low pH conditions. Seasonal changes in the ANC were more pronounced in the eastern subbasin because of the predominance of inorganic carbon buffering in the circumneutral pH waters. Lakes in the west-central Adirondacks have characteristically short hydraulic residence times and elevated nitric acid inputs. As a result these waters may be more susceptible to surface water acidification than other "acid-sensitive" lake districts in eastern North America. Given the apparent interregional differences, extrapolation of chemical trends in the Adirondacks to other areas may be tenuous. 
40343634|Hydrochemical patterns across groundwater-fed wetlands, especially carbonate and redox gradients, can influence phosphorus (P) availability by controlling its distribution among different soil pools. We explored these linkages by comparing shallow (5-20 cm) soil properties along groundwater flowpaths in two rich fens, a marl fen, and a poor fen. Organic matter content, bulk density, and total elemental content varied more with depth to underlying drift materials than with water table fluctuation, but also were influenced by groundwater discharge, which stabilized water table elevations and controlled redox conditions. Total sulfur and calcium content increased where pore-water chemistry indicated active iron and sulfate reduction. Calcium mineral dynamics, however, did not appear to influence  availability: first, calcium carbonate (CaCO) accounted for < 2% of the soil composition, except in the marl fen where it accounted for 20-25% of the soil composition. Second, Ca-bound P pools, determined from hydrochloric extraction of wet soil samples, accounted for < 25% of the inorganic soil P pool. In contrast, iron-bound P determined from bicarbonate-buffered dithionite solution, accounted for 50-80% of the inorganic soil P, and increased where there was evidence of groundwater mixing, as did P release rates inferred from incubated anion resin bags. The total carbon and phosphorus content of organic-rich soils as well as available and labile P pools were strongly correlated with pore-water iron and alkalinity concentrations. Groundwater discharge and resulting hydrochemical gradients explained significant variation in soil composition and P availability across each site. Results highlight the importance of conducting biogeochemical studies in the context of a site's shallow geologic setting and suggest mechanisms supporting the diverse plant species unique to groundwater wetlands.
1469809|We document an example of a forested watershed at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory with an extraordinary tendency to retain dissolved organic matter (DOM) generated in large quantities within the ecosystem. Our objectives were to determine fluxes of dissolved organic C, N, and P (DOC, DON, DOP, respectively), in water draining through each stratum of the ecosystem and synthesize information on the physicochemical, biological and hydrologic factors leading to retention of dissolved organic nutrients in this ecosystem. The ecosystem retained 99.3, 97.3, and 99.0% of water soluble organic C, N and P, respectively, produced in litterfall, throughfall, and root exudates. Exports in streamwater were 4.1 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of DOC, 0.191 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of DON, and 0.011 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of DOP. Fluxes of DON were greater than those of inorganic N in all strata. Most DOC, DON, and DOP was removed from solution in the A and B horizons, with DOC being rapidly adsorbed to Fe and Al oxyhydroxides, most likely by ligand exchange. DON and DOC were released gradually from the forest floor over the year. Water soluble organic C produced in litterfall and throughfall had a disjoint distribution of half-decay times with very labile and very refractory fractions so that most labile DOC was decomposed before being leached into the mineral soil and refractory fractions dominated the DOC transported through the ecosystem. We hypothesize that this watershed retained soluble organic nutrients to an extraordinary degree because the soils have very high contents of Fe and Al oxyhydroxides with high adsorption capacities and because the predominant hydrologic pathway is downwards as unsaturated flow through a strongly adsorbing A and B horizon. The well recognized retention mechanisms for inorganic nutrients combine with adsorption of DOM and hydrologic pathway to efficiently prevent leaching of both soluble inorganic and organic nutrients in this watershed.
1468515|Microbial growth rate was estimated by multiplying <sup>15</sup>N immobilization by an estimated microbial C:N ratio. This growth rate, in combination with measurements of respiration, was used to calculate growth efficiency. Growth rates and efficiencies were calculated for grassland and cultivated soils of three textures. Calculated efficiencies (Y<sub>c</sub>), assuming a microbial C:N ratio of 7, ranged from 32 to 54. Cultivated soils tended to have higher Y<sub>c</sub> values than did grassland soils. This calculation depends on several hard-to-verify assumptions, but yields numbers that should be of great interest in comparative studies.
41490557|The effect of episodic drought on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in peatlands has been the subject of considerable debate, as decomposition and DOC production is thought to increase under aerobic conditions, yet decreased DOC concentrations have been observed during drought periods. Decreased DOC solubility due to drought-induced acidification driven by sulphur (S) redox reactions has been proposed as a causal mechanism; however evidence is based on a limited number of studies carried out at a few sites. To test this hypothesis on a range of different peats, we carried out controlled drought simulation experiments on peat cores collected from six sites across Great Britain. Our data show a concurrent increase in sulphate (SO) and a decrease in DOC across all sites during simulated water table draw-down, although the magnitude of the relationship between SO and DOC differed between sites. Instead, we found a consistent relationship across all sites between DOC decrease and acidification measured by the pore water acid neutralising capacity (ANC). ANC provided a more consistent measure of drought-induced acidification than SO alone because it accounts for differences in base cation and acid anions concentrations between sites. Rewetting resulted in rapid DOC increases without a concurrent increase in soil respiration, suggesting DOC changes were primarily controlled by soil acidity not soil biota. These results highlight the need for an integrated analysis of hydrologically driven chemical and biological processes in peatlands to improve our understanding and ability to predict the interaction between atmospheric pollution and changing climatic conditions from plot to regional and global scales.
1469538|The sources of spatial and temporal variation and rates of nutrient deposition via throughfall were studied for 9 months in the Anavilhanas archipelago of the Negro River, Brazil. A total of 30 events was sampled individually for rain and throughfall chemistry in a 1-ha plot of flooded forest. Throughfall samples were collected in 40 collectors distributed in five parallel transects in the study plot, while rain was collected in 4 collectors in an adjacent channel. Volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations of solutes in rain were consistently lower than in throughfall, except for H<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Ratios of VWM concentrations of rain to throughfall indicated that K<sup>+</sup>, followed by Mg<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, were the most enhanced solutes as rain passed through the forest canopy. The deposition of solutes varied significantly among transects, except for Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and was significantly correlated with maximum flooding depth, foliar nutrient content, soil fertility and canopy closure for most solutes. The concentrations of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and most major ions were higher in throughfall compared to those in rain due to canopy exchange and dry deposition. In contrast, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> were retained due to immobilization by leafy canopy and ion exchange processes. Solute inputs via throughfall (not including stemflow) to a floodplain lake (Lake Prato) of the archipelago accounted for 30 to 64% of the total for most solutes in the lake at high water, which indicates that throughfall is an important source of nutrients to the aquatic ecosystem of the Anavilhanas archipelago.
1469032|Sedimentation rates were estimated in a Central Amazonian Black-water inundation forest. Sediment deposition on the forest ground, remote from the river bed, during an annual flood period, is of the order of 1 to 10 tons per hectare, depending on water depth and duration of flooding. The sediments consisted of fine organic matter, kaolinite, quartz sands and biogenic particles of silica. Their genesis and deposition depend on the interplay between pedogenic, limnological and biological processes. Sediments derive primarily from the materials leached from the soils. Clay soils are the main source of dissolved silica, and the sandy soils are the main sources of organic coumpounds and mineral particles. The physical sedimentation of particles as quartz sand grains only occurs in the upper reaches of the studied river. In the flood plain, the sedimentation is due to the coagulation and deposition of combined mineral particles and humic substances, and to the biological precipitation of the silica leached from the soil by sponges.
20456518|The objective of this study was to evaluate the nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry of an 18-22 year old forested watershed in western Maryland. We hypothesized that this watershed should not exhibit symptoms of N saturation. This watershed was a strong source of nitrate (NO) to the stream in all years, with a mean annual export of 9.5 kg N ha year and a range of 4.4-18.4 kg N ha year. During the 2001 and 2002 water years, wet deposition of inorganic N was 9.0 kg N ha year and 6.3 kg N ha year, respectively. Watershed N export rates in 2001 and 2002 water years were 4.2 kg N ha year and 5.3 kg N ha year, respectively. During the wetter water years of 2003 and 2004, the watershed exported 15.0 kg N ha year and 18.4 kg N ha year, rates that exceeded annual wet deposition of N by a factor of two (7.5 kg N ha year in 2003) and three (5.5 kg N ha year in 2004). Consistent with the high rates of N export, were high concentrations (2.1-3.3%) of N in foliage, wood (0.3%) and fine roots, low C:N ratios in the forest floor (17-24) and mineral soil (14), high percentages (83-96%) of the amount of mineralized N that was nitrified and elevated N concentrations (up to 3 mg N l) in soil solution. Although this watershed contained a young aggrading forest, it exhibited several symptoms of N saturation commonly observed in more mature forests.
1469660| Microbial activity within the environment can have distinct geochemical effects, and so changes in a microbial community structure can result in geochemical change. We examined seasonal changes in both the microbial community and the geochemistry of an inter-tidal salt marsh in north-west England to characterise biogeochemical processes occurring at this site. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis of sediment samples collected at monthly intervals was used to measure seasonal changes in microbial biomass and community structure. The PLFA data were analysed using multivariate techniques (Ward's method and the Mahalanobis distance metric), and we show that the use of the Mahalanobis distance metric improves the statistical analysis by providing detailed information on the reasons samples cluster together and identifying the distinguishing features between the separate clusters. Five clusters of like samples were defined, showing differences in the community structure over the course of a year. At all times, the microbial community was dominated by PLFA associated with aerobic bacteria, but this was most pronounced in summer (August). The abundance of branched fatty acids, a measure of the biomass of anaerobes, started to increase later in the year than did those associated with aerobes and the fungal biomarker 18:26 showed a brief late-summer peak. The salt marsh remained mildly oxic throughout the year despite the increase in microbial respiration, suggested by the large increases in the abundance of PLFA, in the warmer months. The conditions therefore remained most favourable for aerobic species throughout the year, explaining their continual dominance at this site. However, as the abundance of PLFA synthesised by anaerobes increased, increases in dissolved Mn concentrations were observed, which we suggest were due to anaerobic respiration of Mn(IV) to Mn(II). Overall, the geochemical conditions were consistent with the microbial community structure and changes within it. 
41490528|The carbon (C) sink strength of arctic tundra is under pressure from increasing populations of arctic breeding geese. In this study we examined how CO and CH fluxes, plant biomass and soil C responded to the removal of vertebrate herbivores in a high arctic wet moss meadow that has been intensively used by barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) for ca. 20 years. We used 4 and 9 years old grazing exclosures to investigate the potential for recovery of ecosystem function during the growing season (July 2007). The results show greater above-and belowground vascular plant biomass within the grazing exclosures with graminoid biomass being most responsive to the removal of herbivory whilst moss biomass remained unchanged. The changes in biomass switched the system from net emission to net uptake of CO (0.47 and 0.77  mol m s in grazed and exclosure plots, respectively) during the growing season and doubled the C storage in live biomass. In contrast, the treatment had no impact on the CH fluxes, the total litter C pool or the soil C concentration. The rapid recovery of the above ground biomass and CO fluxes demonstrates the plasticity of this high arctic ecosystem in terms of response to changing herbivore pressure.
1468915|Young corn, pea and rapeseed plants were exposed to compressed synthetic air containing varying COS concentrations. The results suggest that COS exchange depends highly on the ambient COS mixing ratios. Ambient COS mixing ratios larger than 150 pptv resulted in a deposition of COS to all plant species studied. Significant (confidence level 95%) COS emission was only detected from rapeseed leaves at COS mixing ratios lower than 90 pptv. We computed COS compensation points around 90 (57-135) pptv and 144 (0-328) pptv COS for rapeseed and corn. For both plant species we found a close correlation between the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and the COS uptake. In contrast to the gas exchange studies with corn and rapeseed, experiments with pea plants revealed neither a change in response to increased COS concentrations of between 350 and 900 pptv COS nor any correlation with photosynthesis. However, for all three plants studied we found indications that COS is taken up preferentially over CO<sub>2</sub> under normal ambient conditions.
41490491|The Gallery forests of the Cerrado biome play a critical role in controlling stream chemistry but little information about biogeochemical processes in these ecosystems is available. This work describes the fluxes of N and P in solutions along a topographic gradient in a gallery forest. Three distinct floristic communities were identified along the gradient: a wet community nearest the stream, an upland dry community adjacent to the woodland savanna and an intermediate community between the two. Transects were marked in the three communities for sampling. Fluxes of N from bulk precipitation to these forests resulted in deposition of 12.6 kg ha y of total N of which 8.8 kg ha was as inorganic N. The throughfall flux of total N was generally <8.4 kg ha year . Throughfall NO-N fluxes were higher (7-32%) while NH-N and organic N fluxes were lower (54-69% and 5-46%) than those in bulk precipitation. The throughfall flux was slightly lower for the wet forest community compared to other communities. Litter leachate fluxes differed among floristic communities with higher NH-N in the wet community. The total N flux was greater in the wet forest than in the dry forest (13.5 vs. 9.4 kg ha year, respectively). The stream water had total N flux of 0.3 kg ha year . The flux of total P through bulk precipitation was 0.7 kg ha year while the mean fluxes of total P in throughfall (0.6 kg ha year) and litter leachate (0.5 kg ha year) declined but did not differ between communities. The low concentrations presented in soil solution and low fluxes in stream water (0.3 and 0.1 kg ha year for N and P, respectively) relative to other flowpaths emphasize the conservative nutrient cycling of these forests and the importance of internal recycling processes for the maintenance and conservation of riparian and stream ecosystems in the Cerrado.
40343639|Evidence for abiotic immobilization of nitrogen (N) in soil is accumulating, but remains controversial. Identifying the fate of N from atmospheric deposition is important for understanding the N cycle of forest ecosystems. We studied soils of two Abies pinsapo fir forests under Mediterranean climate seasonality in southern Spainone with low N availability and the other with symptoms of N saturation. We hypothesized that biotic and abiotic immobilization of nitrate (NO) would be lower in soils under these forests compared to more mesic temperate forests, and that the N saturated stand would have the lowest rates of NO immobilization. Live and autoclaved soils were incubated with added NO (10 g N g dry soil; 99% enriched) for 24 h, and the label was recovered as total dissolved-N, NO, ammonium (NH), or dissolved organic-N (DON). To evaluate concerns about possible iron interference in analysis of NO concentrations, both flow injection analysis (FIA) and ion chromatography (IC) were applied to water extracts, soluble iron was measured in both water and salt extracts, and standard additions of NO to salt extracts were analyzed. Good agreement between FIA and IC analysis, low concentrations of soluble Fe, and 100% (3%) recovery of NO standard additions all pointed to absence of an interference problem for NO quantification. On average, 85% of the added NO label was recovered as NO, which supports our hypothesis that rates of immobilization were generally low in these soils. A small amount (mean = 0.06 g N g dry soil) was recovered as NH in live soils and none in sterilized soils. Mean recovery as DON ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 g N g dry soil, with no statistically significant effect of sterilization or soil type, indicating that this was an abiotic process that occurred at similar rates in both soils. These results demonstrate a detectable, but modest rate of abiotic immobilization of NO to DON, supporting our first hypothesis. These mineral soils may not have adequate carbon availability to support the regeneration of reducing microsites needed for high rates of NO reduction. Our second hypothesis regarding lower expected abiotic immobilization in soils from the N-saturated site was not supported. The rates of N deposition in this region may not be high enough to have swamped the capacity for soil NO immobilization, even in the stand showing some symptoms of N saturation. A growing body of evidence suggests that soil abiotic NO immobilization is common, but that rates are influenced by a combination of factors, including the presence of plentiful available carbon, reduced minerals in anaerobic microsites and adequate NO supply.
20519879|The chemistry of recent fish scales (tench, common carp, amur and European perch) and sub-recent fish scales (European perch and mostly taxonomically not determined) was studied by means of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and electron microprobe from shallow boreholes in the abandoned meander Certak near Uhersk Hradiste. A detailed study of subfossil fish confirms extremely rapid changes in the chemical composition of hydroxylapatite during very early diagenetic processes in the first 2 years, which does not change significantly in the bottom of the boreholes about 25 years old. While there is an enormous increase in Na, K, Ba and Sr, Fe and Mn, there is a major decrease in Mg. The fish scales from 70 to 78 cm (6-8 years old) are approaching already the level of francolite-type hydroxylapatite. The high Na content indicates carbonate substitutions for OH or PO group. Consequently, environmental interpretations based on the chemistry of fossil hydroxylapatites require extreme caution. In recent fish scales, the element concentrations reflect not only the position in the trophic pyramid but also a complicated interplay of the diet, physiological processes and environmental contamination.
24715350|Woody encroachment has dramatically changed land cover patterns in arid and semiarid systems (drylands) worldwide over the past 150 years. This change is known to influence bulk soil carbon (C) pools, but the implications for dynamics and stability of these pools are not well understood. Working in a Chihuahuan Desert C grassland encroached by C creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), we used two density fractionation techniques (2 and 7 pool density fractionations) and isotopic analysis to quantify changes in C pools and dynamics among vegetation microsites typical of an encroachment scenario (remnant intact grassland, shrub subcanopies, and in shrub intercanopy spaces within a shrub-encroached area). The C concentration of bulk soils varied with microsite, with almost twice the C in shrub subcanopies as in intercanopy spaces or remnant grasslands. Estimated SOC accumulation rates from Larrea encroachment (4.79 g C m year under canopies and 1.75 g C m year when intercanopy losses were taken into account) were lower than reported for higher productivity Prosopis systems, but still represent a potentially large regional C sink. The composition of soil C varied among microsites, with the shrub subcanopy C composed of proportionally more light fraction C (<1.85 g cm) and C that was soluble in sodium polytungstate. Grassland soils contained very little carbonate C compared to shrub subcanopies or shrub intercanopy spaces. Stable isotope analyses indicate that inputs from C shrubs were incorporated into all density fractions, even in heavy fractions in which shrub inputs did not change overall C concentration. The seven density fractionation yielded unexpected C patterns, where the two heaviest fractions were strongly depleted in C, indicating strong fractionation following organic matter inputs. These results suggest that the utility of isotope mixing models for determining input sources may be limited in systems with similar fractionation patterns. We propose a five pool model for dryland soil C that includes a relatively dynamic light fraction, aggregate and heavy fractions that are stable in size but that reflect dynamic inputs and outputs, a potentially large and seasonally dynamic pool of soluble C, and a large pool of carbonate C. Combined, these results suggest that dryland soil C pools may be more dynamic than previously recognized.
20519873|The great spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen (N) processing introduces large uncertainties for quantifying N cycles in large scales, e.g. a watershed scale, and hence challenges the present techniques in measuring ecosystem N mass balance. The dual isotopes of nitrate (O and N) integrate signals for both nitrate sources and N processing, making them promising for studies on large scale N cycling. Here, the dual isotopes, as well as some ion tracers, from a subtropical river in south China were reported to identify the main nitrate sources and to assess the possible occurrence and degree of denitrification in the context of monsoon climate. Our results indicated that nitrification of reduced fertilizer N in soil zones was the main nitrate source, with sewage and manure as another important source in dry winter. Seasonal changes of denitrification was apparent by the  1:2 enrichment of O and N from April to August, and suggested to occur over the watershed rather than in the river. The lowest denitrification (10%) occurred in April, when the fertilizer application was strongest and the monsoon rainfall abruptly increased, causing enhancement of leaching. The highest denitrification (48%) took place in August due to the high soil temperature and moisture. In December, denitrification was significant (26%) perhaps due to the high enough temperature for microbial activities, whereas the low soil moisture appeared to limit the degree of denitrification. This study suggests that the seasonal variations in denitrification should be taken into account when estimating regional N mass balance.
20055272|Seasonal variations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) (NO-N and NH-N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were determined in Fuirosos, an intermittent stream draining an unpolluted Mediterranean forested catchment (10.5 km) in Catalonia (Spain). The influence of flow on streamwater concentrations and seasonal differences in quality and origin of dissolved organic matter, inferred from dissolved organic carbon to nitrogen ratios (DOC:DON ratios), were examined. During baseflow conditions, nitrate and ammonium had opposite behaviour, probably controlled by biological processes such as vegetation uptake and mineralization activity. DON concentrations did not have a seasonal trend. During storms, nitrate and DON increased by several times but discharge was not a good predictor of nutrient concentrations. DOC:DON ratios in streamwater were around 26, except during the months following drought when DOC:DON ratios ranged between 42 and 20 during baseflow and stormflow conditions, respectively. Annual N export during 2000-2001 was 70 kg
1468844| Sr/Ca ratios in modern brachiopod shells reflect variations in ambient seawater, whereas their Na contents show no relationship with water depth or habitat. Their Mn and Fe contents are controlled, in part, by leaching of these elements from oxide coatings or the low input/sedimentation rate of detrital material into depositional areas such as Quatsino Sound. For most Carboniferous brachiopods from North America, the Mn and Fe contents are similar to those recorded by their Recent counterparts. The high Mn and Fe contents in the brachiopods from shales suggest several possibilities for these levels. One possibility is the leaching of Mn and Fe from oxide coatings/matrix which was not completely removed in the cleaning process, or the high levels in part reflect unusual depositional conditions (some degree of anoxia) for the local shaly environments. The Sr/Ca ratio of brachiopods and, by inference, complementary seawater, did not vary significantly during the Carboniferous. The Sr/Ca minimum observed in brachiopods of Mississippian age coincides with a dip in the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr curve and correlates with the Hercynian orogeny. This is attributed to the cycling of seawater through mid-ocean ridge basalts, and postulated exchange reactions account for variation in the composition of seawater-Ca. The unidirectional trend of heavier  <sup>13</sup>C values from the Devonian to the Permian is intricately coupled with the evolution of the terrestrial biomass. In addition to expansion of terrestrial plants, burial of reduced carbon in the form of coal (organic matter) contributed to the observed shift. The start of the Permo-Pennsylvanian glaciation is marked by a negative excursion of the secular carbon trend, which is linked to weathering of reduced carbon and its return to the oceanic reservoir with its oxidized carbon. The oxygen isotope values reflect the unidirectional trend towards higher values of the carbon data with decreasing geologic age. Negative excursions of the trend may be related to extensive weathering of terrestrial and submarine rocks, whereas positive excursions may be related to hydrothermal alteration of submarine rocks and dehydration of oceanic crust during times of active sea-floor spreading. Oxygen-calculated water temperatures of unaltered brachiopod material are unrealistically high for all of the Devonian, and the Chesterian-Meramecian, Desmoinesian-Missourian, and Artinskian Epochs. During these times maximum water temperatures of 42 to 56C are well above the thermal threshold of protein denaturation. This process, which is lethal to most higher organisms, demands an adjustment in oxygen of -2.5 for samples older than Missourian, and of -1.25 for samples spanning the Missourian-Artinskian interval. With these adjustments and salinity considerations made prior to calculations, water temperatures become reasonable for the Late Paleozoic epeiric, tropical seas of North America. 
1469725|To quantify the extent to which biomass and phosphorus in particular is removed from an aquatic system via sedimentation as well as to identify factors that influence sedimentation of nutrient elements, various characterizations of suspended and settling particulate matter were made in Trout Lake, Wisconsin, USA. The proportion of water column phosphorus reaching sediment traps showed a seasonal component with a minimum during late summer. Biogenic silicon analysis indicated that relatively high rates of phosphorus removal were associated with the sedimentation of siliceous algae (diatoms) from the water column. Estimates of the impact of nutrient removal through diatom sedimentation indicate that this process can reduce primary production by decreasing the amount of nutrient remineralization in the water column during the stratified period.
1468643|The organic matter present in coarse- and fine-grained sample preparations of a peat core from Minnie's Lake, Okefenokee Swamp (Georgia, USA) was analysed on a molecular level by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of alditol acetates obtained from polysaccharides after acid hydrolysis and derivatization and by flash pyrolysis-mass spectrometry. We found that the coarse-grained fraction is dominated by neutral monosaccharides derived from vascular plants whilst the fine-grained fraction is dominated by neutral monosaccharides derived from microorganisms. Relatively high contributions of xylose discriminate the Taxodium derived peat from the underlying peats derived from Carex and Nymphaea which show relatively low contributions of this sugar. Factor-discriminant analysis of the Py-MS data indicates that most carbohydrate degradation is restricted to the upper peat levels and that guaiacyl and syringyl type lignins are better preserved than carbohydrates. Resinous organic matter -- presumably derived from Taxodium -- is selectively preserved in the fine-grained fraction. Deviant monosaccharide concentrations and Py-MS results observed for the top sample of the Carex peat were explained by oxygenation of the peat, a concomitantly high microbial activity and subsequent preservation of the organic material due to the action of phytotoxins derived from Taxodium.
40343528|This study investigates soil NO dynamics in forest soils representing early (3-years) and late (>50 years) post-harvest succession in Atlantic Canada over a 9-month snow-free period in order to develop a better understanding of the role of managed forests as sources and sinks of NO. We couple measurement of surface flux with detailed measurements of subsurface NO concentrations at four mineral soil depths (0, 5, 20 and 35 cm) at 40 plots located within four sites. Median surface fluxes were similar at all sites regardless of the management stage (5 to +19 ugNON/m/day), with all sites behaving as net sinks and sources of NO over the measurement period. Subsurface mineral soil NO concentrations at early (3-year) post-harvest succession sites, which ranged from median values of 362 ppbv at 0 cm to 1783 ppbv at 35 cm depth, were significantly higher than late post-harvest succession sites where median concentrations ranged from 329 ppbv at 0 cm to 460 ppbv at 35 cm depth. Examination of relationships between subsurface gas storage and surface flux magnitudes, suggested although recently harvested forest soils may be producing NO at a greater rate than mature forest soils, observed patterns are consistent with a strong sink for this gas that prevents its conservative transport through the soil profile, and ultimate emission to the atmosphere through the majority of the measurement period.
20519846|The Nanjing Declaration on Nitrogen Management, signed in Nanjing in October 2004, calls for national governments to optimize N management by several strategies including assessment of N cycles. Here we develop a first N budget for New Zealand (267,000 km), at both national and regional scales. The national inputs are estimated to be 36.5 kg/ha, mainly from biological N fixation, but also increasingly from fertilizer application and atmospheric deposition. The outputs are estimated at 40.5 kg/ha. Biological N fixation from legumes in pasture was the most important input in most regions. Exceptions were Auckland, with a large urban population, and the West Coast of the South Island, with large tracts of rain forest. Outputs were distributed in the order leaching &gt; ammonia volatilisation &gt; erosion = produce = denitrification. These outputs are very different from global averages because of the large numbers of grazing animals on pasture. A large loss occurs between the subsoil and the oceans, and further research is needed to identify these pathways. Riverine export of N was generally well correlated with inputs.
1469605| This study evaluated the impact of P supply on rice plant development and the methane budget of rice fields by 2 different approaches: (1) root growth, exudation and aerenchyma formation were recorded in an experiment with hydroponic solution; (2) dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> concentration and CH<sub>4</sub> emission were investigated in a pot experiment. In both approaches, we used three different cultivars and three levels of P supply. In the experiment with solution culture (0.5 ppm, 5 ppm, and 10 ppm P), root exudation ranged between 0.5 to 36.7  mol C plant<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> and increased steadily with plant growth at given P level. Low P supply resulted in  depressed shoot growth but increased root growth in culture solution,  increments in the root/shoot ratio by factors of 1.4 to 1.9 at flowering stage,  enhanced the development of root aerenchyma, and  stimulation of root exudation per plant by factors of 1.3-1.8 as compared to medium P supply and by factors of 2.1-2.4 as compared to high P supply. However, root exudation did not differ among treatments when related to the dry weight of roots. Thus, high exudation rates were caused by larger root biomass and not by higher activity of the root tissue. The pot experiment was conducted with a P-deficient soil that was either left without amendment or fertilized by 25 and 50 mg P kg<sub>soil</sub><sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Low P supply resulted in  higher CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations in soil solution; i.e., at flowering stage the soil solution concentrations were 34-50 M under P deficiency and 10-22 M under ample P supply and  significant increases of CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates during the later stages of plant growth. These findings reflect a chain of response mechanisms to P stress, that ultimately lead to higher methane emission rates. 
40343519|Field experiments were carried out in order to assess the practicality and application of SO as a tracer of the physical and geochemical fate of aerially derived sulfur in peat. Six enclosures were isolated in a lowland peat with high historical acid sulfate inputs at Thorne Moors, UK, and treated with regular additions of 99.9% pure SO for 12 months. The total S sulfate addition resulted in negligible change to the sulfate concentration, but allowed unequivocal change to the isotopic composition of sulfate inputs relative to pre-experiment control data set. Migration and biogeochemical transformations of the S tracer were monitored via depth-specific sampling of surface and pore-waters every 6 weeks, and sacrificial sampling of solid peat at 12, 24, and 48 week intervals. Tracer incorporation into the various sulfur forms within the surface and pore-waters, vegetation, organic and inorganic fractions of the peat was apparent through strong positive deviation of S from natural values (in comparison with 18 months control data set for the same site). Consistency within enclosures is good and a detailed model of sulfur cycling within each enclosure can be established but natural variability in the control data and differences between replicate enclosures prevents more quantitative assessment. The S tracer was initially rapidly removed from surface waters. The majority of uptake was by living vegetation (5.7-33% of tracer added, mean 17.6%), or through transformation to the organic fraction of the upper peat (25 cm) after rapid bacterial reduction of sulfate to sulfide. Despite penetration of S labelled sulfate to deeper pore-waters over time, there was no significant reduction to sulfide or subsequent incorporation into organic or inorganic fraction at these depths (>25 cm); organic and inorganic sulfur, and porewater sulfide retained their initial unlabelled isotopic compositions. This limitation on sulfur cycling at relatively shallow depth may be attributed to diminished labile organic matter inhibiting the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria or poisoning of sulfate reducers by high dissolved sulfide, after long-term sulfur pollution of this ecosystem.
24715148|Recent research has highlighted that humans are perturbing the global silica (Si) cycle through land use change. Here we compare in-stream Si biogeochemistry across four rivers that lie along a gradient of land use change in New England, USA. Differences between basins were most notable during the late winter/early spring period when dissolved Si (DSi) concentrations declined significantly in all but the most urban site. Declines in DSi concentration could not be attributed to volumetric dilution by higher discharges, nor in-stream phytoplankton growth, as biogenic Si concentrations did not increase during this period. We provide evidence that uptake of Si by terrestrial vegetation, specifically trees, is responsible for the observed declines of in-stream DSi concentrations (a loss of 2.7 M day at the most forested site). We hypothesize that sap flow during this late winter/early spring period is driving this accretion. We estimate that 68 kmol Si km is accreted annually by New England forests, falling well within the range of forest Si accretion rates found in published studies. This analysis increases our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to altered Si biogeochemistry in rivers draining watersheds with different land use.
1468988|Comparative, experimental studies on sediment cores from freshwater and brackish-marine conditions reveal major differences in the benthic exchange of phosphate across the sediment-water interface when shifting from anoxic to oxic conditions. The flux of phosphate to the sediment during this shift was found to be mediated mainly by scavenging from newly formed colloidal ferric oxohydroxide. The capacity of the iron-rich particles to scavenge phosphorus depended on the stoichiometric ratio between dissolved iron and phosphorus built up in the supernatant water during reducing conditions. The freshwater system was characterized by high iron to phosphorus ratios in the dissolved phase and thus most of the phosphate was incorporated into the colloidal iron oxohydroxide during the oxygenation. In contrast, the marine systems reached lower iron to phosphorus ratios during the anoxic period which resulted in less efficient phosphate scavenging. Consequently, significant amounts of phosphate remained dissolved in the marine systems after the change to oxic conditions, possibly increasing the proportion of phosphate recycled to the euphotic zone. Manganese showed a consistent redox-dependent behaviour in all the investigated systems, but interacted neither with phosphate nor with iron.
40343617|Human alteration of the nitrogen cycle has stimulated research on nitrogen cycling in many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, where analyses of nitrate (NO) by standard laboratory methods are common. A recent study by Colman et al. (Biogeochemistry 84: 161-169, 2007) identified a potential analytical interference of soluble iron (Fe) with NO quantification by standard flow-injection analysis of soil extracts, and suggested that this interference may have led Dail et al. (Biogeochemistry 54: 131-146, 2001) to make an erroneous assessment of abiotic nitrate immobilization in prior N pool dilution studies of Harvard Forest soils. In this paper, we reproduce the Fe interference problem systematically and show that it is likely related to dissolved, complexed-Fe interfering with the colorimetric analysis of NO. We also show how standard additions of NOand NOto soil extracts at native dissolved Fe concentrations reveal when the Fe interference problem occurs, and permit the assessment of its significance for past, present, and future analyses. We demonstrate low soluble Fe concentrations and good recovery of standard additions of NO and NO in extracts of sterilized Harvard Forest soils. Hence, we maintain that rapid NO immobilization occurred in sterilized samples of the Harvard Forest O horizon in the study by Dail et al. (2001). Furthermore, additional evidence is accumulating in the literature for rapid disappearance of NO added to soils, suggesting that our observations were not the result of an isolated analytical artifact. The conditions for NO reduction are likely to be highly dependent on microsite properties, both in situ and in the laboratory. The so-called "ferrous wheel hypothesis" (Davidson et al., Glob Chang Biol 9: 228-236, 2003) remains an unproven, viable explanation for published observations.
1469331|There are spatial differences in methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations in biota in Water Conservation Areas 2 and 3 in the Everglades, with higher concentrations generally found in the southern areas. Fish and hemipterans had the most MeHg on a wet weight basis, with levels exceeding 30 ng g<sup>-1</sup>. The magnitude of MeHg accumulation in biota varies seasonally and does not always appear to be associated with changes in water column concentration. This is exemplified by periphyton, the base of the foodweb in the Everglades, at a high nutrient sampling site. Although limited in scope, MeHg concentrations presented for biota provide insight into beginning to understand the dynamic nature of Hg transfer in the Everglades foodweb on a spatial and temporal basis.
1469274| The hypothesis that SO<sub>4</sub> desorption can explain apparent long term net SO<sub>4</sub>-S losses (5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> on average) at the Lake Laflamme catchment from 1982 to 1991 is examined. Field observations show that SO<sub>4</sub> concentrations in the soil solution are strongly buffered during percolation through the Bf horizon. In the Bf horizon, SO<sub>4</sub> exchange reactions between the adsorbed and aqueous compartments are rapid (hours). Most (60%) of the adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub> may be readily desorbed with deionized water. These observations and the presence of an important adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub>-S reservoir in the Bf horizon (113 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) as compared with annual wet SO<sub>4</sub>-S deposition (7 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), suggest that on the short-term, adsorption and desorption reactions can control dissolved SO<sub>4</sub> concentration in the Bf horizon. To examine whether SO<sub>4</sub> adsorption/desorption could explain long-term SO<sub>4</sub>-S losses by the catchment, an aggregated Langmuir isotherm for the Bf horizon was used to calculate the catchment's resilience to changing SO<sub>4</sub>-S loads. The results indicate that the soil should adjust rapidly (within 4 years) to changing SO<sub>4</sub>-S loads and that SO<sub>4</sub> desorption alone cannot explain long-term net SO<sub>4</sub>-S losses. Other possibilities, such as an underestimation of dry deposition or the weathering of S-bearing minerals also appear unlikely. Our results suggest a net release of SO<sub>4</sub>-S from the soil organic S reservoirs (1230 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) present in the catchment. 
40647952|Understanding and predicting the responses of plant communities to multiple overlapping disturbances remains a challenging task. Hurricane Wilma represents a large, yet infrequent type of disturbance that was superimposed on an existing disturbance gradient of time since fire. We examined disturbance and recovery patterns in response to these overlapping disturbances by measuring how canopy structure, fine roots, mycorrhizae, and soil nitrogen dynamics, varied along a fire chronosequence in the 2 years after Hurricane Wilma. Hurricane damage increased canopy openness in all serai stages. In the early-seral stage, canopy openness returned to prehurricane conditions within 2 years, whereas canopy openness in the late-seral stage remained significantly higher throughout the study. We observed no significant change in root length density in the early-and mid-seral stages. However, in the late-seral stage, root length density was significantly reduced immediately after the hurricane and remained so 2 years after the hurricane. In the late-seral stage, we also observed a significant reduction in percent soil nitrogen and a significant increase in soil nitrogen isotopic composition (N) values, indicating a loss of soil nitrogen. In contrast, in the early-and midseral stages, there were no significant changes in percent nitrogen or soil N values. Results from this study suggest that forest fire disturbance history influences responses to hurricane damage. Moreover, feedbacks between aboveground and belowground processes have the potential to influence forest recovery.
1469911|The occurrence of alkylated volatile iodide and selenide species was evidenced and investigated in water, sediments and overlying atmosphere of three major European estuaries, such as the Gironde (F), the Rhine (NL) and the Scheldt (B/NL), along with the salinity gradient. For iodine, up to eight volatile species were observed as alkyl-iodides in estuarine waters. The major one (ca. 40%) was methyl-iodide (MeI) with average seasonal concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 pmol l<sup>-1</sup>. Other species observed were found to correspond to several halomethane derivatives and light alkyl-iodide species. For selenium, dimethyl selenide (Me<sub>2</sub>Se) was the main compound (ca. 90%) over three methyl-selenides encountered in estuarine waters. Me<sub>2</sub>Se average seasonal concentrations were found to range between 0.2 and 100 pmol l<sup>-1</sup> in the water column. The occurrence of methylated iodides and selenides seems to be mainly related to the algae's biomass turnover as indicated by photosynthetic pigment tracers (i.e. chlorophyll a and phaeopigments) and seasonal variation of surface water concentrations. The production and release of gaseous iodide and selenide compounds may then result from natural biological pathways leading to methylation of their inorganic form. Finally, significant volatilisation rates were evaluated leading to average seasonal flux rates for total volatile iodide and selenide compounds ranging from 4 to 100 and from 1 to 75 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> respectively. Estuarine mass balance estimated from MeI and Me<sub>2</sub>Se distributions indicates that volatilisation to the atmosphere represents a primary sink for MeI and Me<sub>2</sub>Se from estuarine surface waters.
1469712|Previous research has suggested that nitrogen-fixing lichens can play an important role in the nitrogen cycle of early primary successional systems and other extreme environments. In this study, we estimate rates of nitrogen fixation by a nitrogen-fixing lichen, Stereocaulon vulcani, at 1500 m on the northeast slope of Mauna Loa volcano. Using microclimate measurements and a climate-driven model of nitrogen fixation, we estimate that S. vulcani fixes between 0.2 and 0.45 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. We calculate that S. vulcani could have derived 40% of its nitrogen content from biological fixation.
1469315| A microwave technique for digesting foliage samples was developed and evaluated for quantifying low levels of Hg by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy, CVAFS. The method meets three criteria: (1) to digest all sample material completely and consistently, (2) to reduce sample digestion time to less than one hour, and (3) to maintain a low analytical blank. Mean recovery of NIST standards was 906%. Samples that were analyzed by this technique and by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis compared within 15%. This method also compared within 15% of hot acid digestion methods on samples prepared and analyzed by CVAFS at different laboratories in the First International Mercury in Foliage Intercomparison of Methods (FIM)<sup>2</sup>. The largest source of variability in all of the interlaboratory comparisons was sample inhomogeneity rather than analytical error. 
20456524|In this paper, we propose a structure for organo-mineral associations in soils based on recent insights concerning the molecular structure of soil organic matter (SOM), and on extensive published evidence from empirical studies of organo-mineral interfaces. Our conceptual model assumes that SOM consists of a heterogeneous mixture of compounds that display a range of amphiphilic or surfactant-like properties, and are capable of self-organization in aqueous solution. An extension of this self-organizational behavior in solution, we suggest that SOM sorbs to mineral surfaces in a discrete zonal sequence. In the contact zone, the formation of particularly strong organo-mineral associations appears to be favored by situations where either (i) polar organic functional groups of amphiphiles interact via ligand exchange with singly coordinated mineral hydroxyls, forming stable inner-sphere complexes, or (ii) proteinaceous materials unfold upon adsorption, thus increasing adhesive strength by adding hydrophobic interactions to electrostatic binding. Entropic considerations dictate that exposed hydrophobic portions of amphiphilic molecules adsorbed directly to mineral surfaces be shielded from the polar aqueous phase through association with hydrophobic moieties of other amphiphilic molecules. This process can create a membrane-like bilayer containing a hydrophobic zone, whose components may exchange more easily with the surrounding soil solution than those in the contact zone, but which are still retained with considerable force. Sorbed to the hydrophilic exterior of hemimicellar coatings, or to adsorbed proteins, are organic molecules forming an outer region, or kinetic zone, that is loosely retained by cation bridging, hydrogen bonding, and other interactions. Organic material in the kinetic zone may experience high exchange rates with the surrounding soil solution, leading to short residence times for individual molecular fragments. The thickness of this outer region would depend more on input than on the availability of binding sites, and would largely be controlled by exchange kinetics. Movement of organics into and out of this outer region can thus be viewed as similar to a phase-partitioning process. The zonal concept of organo-mineral interactions presented here offers a new basis for understanding and predicting the retention of organic compounds, including contaminants, in soils and sediments.
1469343|Plant community structure is expected to regulate the microbial processes of nitrification and denitrification by controlling the availability of inorganic N substrates. Thus it could also be a factor in the concomitant release of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O from soils as a result of these processes. C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants differ in several attributes related to the cycling of nitrogen and were hypothesized to yield differences in trace gas exchange between soil and atmosphere. In this study we estimated fluxes of NO, N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> from soils of shortgrass steppe communities dominated by either C<sub>3</sub> plants, C<sub>4</sub> plants or mixtures of the two types. We collected gas samples weekly from two sites, a sandy clay loam and a clay, throughout the growing seasons of 1995 and 1996 Plant functional type effects on gas fluxes at the clay site were not apparent, however we found several differences among plant communities on the sandy clay loam. CH<sub>4</sub> uptake from atmosphere to soil was significantly greater on C<sub>4</sub> plots than C<sub>3</sub> plots in both years. NO fluxes were significantly greater from C<sub>4</sub> plots than from C<sub>3</sub> plots in 1995. NO fluxes from C<sub>3</sub> and mixed plots were not significantly different between 1995 and 1996, however fluxes from C<sub>4</sub> plots were significantly greater in 1995 compared to 1996. Results indicate that under certain environmental conditions, particularly when factors such as moisture and temperature are not limiting, plant community composition can play an important role in regulating trace gas exchange.
1468896|Suspended particulate barium was measured in the Western Mediterranean along 4 profiles sampled during the PHYCEMED 1 cruise in 1981. The non-terrigenous fraction of particulate barium (i.e. excess Ba; Ba<sub>xs</sub>) can account for up to 96% of total barium. This fraction follows the barite settling and dissolution rate model we described earlier for the Atlantic Ocean, confirming barite as the carrier of excess barium. We propose that these Ba<sub>xs</sub> concentrations, which are higher in the Western Mediterranean than in the overall Atlantic, may represent an adaptation of the microplankton to the high densities and density gradients of surface Mediterranean waters. A mass-balance for Ba in the Mediterranean Sea shows: (1) that the atmospheric source must be much more important than previously reported: (2) that contrary to the Atlantic situation, the internal recycling of barium is of little importance compared to the flow of barium through the system.
20519824|Large-scale changes in land use are occurring in many tropical regions, with significant impacts on nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemistry. In this study we examine the relationships between land use, anthropogenic nutrient inputs, and riverine nutrient exports in a major agricultural watershed of the Pacific coast of South America, the Guayas River basin of Ecuador. We present comprehensive nutrient budgets for nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) for the Guayas River basin and 10 sub-watersheds. We quantify the four major anthropogenic nutrient fluxes into and out of the region: N and P fertilizer application, N fixation by leguminous crops, net import/export of N and P in agricultural products (food and feed), and atmospheric deposition. We also estimate inputs of N from biological N fixation in forests and of P from weathering sources in soils and bedrock. The sum of these sources represents net inputs of N and P to each watershed region. Overall, synthetic fertilizers are the largest input to the Guayas Basin for N (53%) and P (57%), and the largest outputs are N and P in crops. Losses of N and P in river export account for 14-38% of total N and P inputs, and there is significant accumulation of N and P, or unmeasured forms of N and P export, in most of the sub-basins. Nutrient balances are indicative of the sustainability of land use practices in a region, where a negative balance of N or P indicates nutrient depletion and subsequent loss of soil fertility, yield, and economic viability. Although the nutrient balance of the entire Guayas Basin is positive, there are negative or near zero balances in two sub-watersheds with extensive banana, coffee and permanent crops. In these basins, degradation of soil quality may be occurring due to these net nutrient losses. Our data show that nutrients are leaving the basin primarily as export crops, with riverine losses of nutrients smaller than crop exports. Nonetheless, there is a direct relationship between nutrient inputs and river outputs, suggesting that agricultural management practices in the basin may have direct impacts on N and P delivery to the highly productive Guayas estuary.
40980879|Acid N depositions in the Bohemian Forest during the second half of the last century caused enormous soil acidification which led to the leaching of essential nutrients including nitrates. We investigated the effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and pH on the abundance of 16S RDNA, nirK and nirS gene copies in four spruce forest sites. Soil samples for molecular based quantification (qPCR) were taken from the organic litter and humus layers. The amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved nitrogen (DN) were much lower in highly acidified soils. We found a strong correlation between nirK denitrifiers and the amount of available P (r = 0.83, p < 0.001), which suggested a higher nutrient sensitivity of this group of denitrifying bacteria. Additionally, we found that correlations between the amount of nirK denitrifiers and DOC and pH are exponentional showing two important threshold values, being 4.8 mol kg and 5, respectively. The amount of nirK denitrifiers rapidly decreased below these values. The amount of nirK and nirS denitrifiers was higher in the organic litter horizon than the organic humus horizon at all sampling sites.
1468989| Methane emissions from three wetland habitats in the Mississippi River deltaic plain were measured over a three year period. Flux data collected indicate that each habitat was a net source of methane to the atmosphere throughout the year. Average emission from a Taxodium distichum / Nyssa aquatica (bald cypress / water tupelo) swamp forest was 146  199 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> while emissions from a Sagittaria lancifolia (bulltongue) freshwater marsh averaged 251  188 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>. Methane flux from a Spartina patens / Sagittaria lancifolia intermediate marsh was significantly higher, 912  923 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>. Seasonal variation was significant with emissions being higher in the late summer and early fall. Significant diurnal emissions were observed from the Sagittaria lancifolia marsh site. Soil temperature (5 and 10 cm depths) was found to be significantly correlated with methane emission from the three sites. 
1468892|Eight forest sites representing a large range of climate, vegetation, and productivity were sampled in a transect across Oregon to study the relationships between aboveground stand characteristics and soil microbial properties. These sites had a range in leaf area index of 0.6 to 16 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>-2</sup> and net primary productivity of 0.3 to 14 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Measurements of soil and forest floor inorganic N concentrations and in situ net N mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and soil respiration were made monthly for one year. Microbial biomass C and anaerobic N mineralization, an index of N availability, were also measured. Annual mean concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ranged from 37 to 96 mg N kg<sup>-1</sup> in the forest floor and from 1.7 to 10.7 mg N kg<sup>-1</sup> in the mineral soil. Concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were low (<latex>$<1\ \text{mg N kg}^{-1}$</latex>) at all sites. Net N mineralization and nitrification, as measured by the buried bag technique, were low on most sites and denitrification was not detected at any site. Available N varied from 17 to 101 mg N kg<sup>-1</sup>, microbial biomass C ranged from 190 to 1230 mg C kg<sup>-1</sup>, and soil respiration rates varied from 1.3 to 49 mg C kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> across these sites. Seasonal peaks in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations and soil respiration rates were usually observed in the spring and fall. The soils data were positively correlated with several aboveground variables, including leaf area index and net primary productivity, and the near infrared-to-red reflectance ratio obtained from the airborne simulator of the Thematic Mapper satellite. The data suggest that close relationships between aboveground productivity and soil microbial processes exist in forests approaching semi-equilibrium conditions.
20456412|Mangroves represent a major environment of tropical coasts. They are highly productive, and act both as a source and a sink of organic carbon. Concentrations and characteristics (fluorescence and hydrophobic-hydrophilic fractions) of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were investigated in relation to the organic content of sediments and to the chemistry of pore waters along the coastline of French Guiana. The pore waters studied were extracted (centrifugation, soil moisture sampler) from sediments cored beneath A. germinans mangrove stands representative of development stages: pioneer, mature and senescent. In order to asses the effects of seasonal changes, two cores were performed in each location, just after dry and wet seasons, respectively. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in pore waters of the upper sediment were found to increase, from 0.7 mmol l under the pioneers to 9 under senescent mangroves. The evolution of sedimentary organic carbon (SedOC) in the same sediment paralleled that of DOC, increasing from 0.7 to 28%. On the contrary, in the lower parts of sediment cores SedOC and DOC displayed contrasting vertical trends: SedOC decreased sharply with depth while DOC increased, reaching concentrations up to 30 mmol l at 50 cm in the older, senescent mangroves. In addition, the Fluorescence/DOC ratios and the hydrophobic contents of DOC were higher at greater depths in most cores, expressing changes in the DOC composition. These results suggest that the DOC of the upper layers originated directly from the SedOC of the enclosing sediment, while the hydrophobic and fluorescent DOC accumulated in the anoxic bottom layer. The mechanisms responsible for this accumulation at depth requires additional research to be fully understood. However, the anoxic conditions and high pH values prevailing in the lower sediment, by lessening DOM sorption and enhancing SedOC dissolution, may be partly responsible for the high DOC concentrations and fluorescences at depth. In addition, seasonal variation may be involved. During the rainy season, water sources were mixed resulting in lower DOC concentrations in the upper sediment, whereas during the dry season, increased evapotranspiration concentrate salts and DOC, which are transported vertically with percolating water.
1469749|We investigated the nutrient uptake capacity of three lakes (Uzlina, Matita and Rosu) within the Danube Delta during high water level in June and low water level in September 1999. Special emphasis was placed on nutrient cycling at the sediment-water interface and on the self-purification capacity of the lakes in the Danube Delta. In order to estimate the nutrient uptake of selected lakes we present in this paper the results of water analyses, benthic flux chamber experiments and deck incubation experiments of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled sediment cores at the inflow and the outlet of the lakes. The external input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and silica into the lakes decreases with increasing distance to the main Danube branches whereas the total dissolved phosphorus input is independent of the hydrological distance to the main branches. The nutrient loading is highest in the inflow channels, and decreases towards the outflow of the lakes. In June, the uptake of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, TDP and Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> in the lakes was higher than in September. In contrast, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake was more intense in September, when benthic release was more intense as well. On average, about 76% of the external plus internal nitrogen and phosphorus input into the lakes was taken up by macrophytes and phytoplankton during the growing season, whereas the uptake of external nutrient input amounted to about 43%. The benthic release of ammonia and silica increases from June to September and indicates, that part of the nutrients taken up during the growing season might be released during winter. We estimate the net impact of the Delta on the nutrient reduction of the Danube during the growing season is about 4.3%, assuming 10% of the Danube water is flowing through the Delta.
1469095|Iron reduction in marine sulfitic environments may occur via a mechanism involving direct bacterial reduction with the use of hydrogen as an electron donor, direct bacterial reduction involving carbon turnover, or by indirect reduction where sulfide acts to reduce iron. In the presented experiments, the relative importance of direct and indirect mechanisms of iron reduction, and the contribution of these two mechanisms to overall carbon turnover has been evaluated in two marsh environments. Sediments collected from two Northeastern US salt marshes each having different Fe (III) histories were incubated with the addition of reactive iron (as amorphous oxyhydroxide). These sediments were either incubated alone or in conjunction with sodium molybdate. Production of both inorganic and organic pore water constituents and a calculation of net carbon production were used as measures to compare the relative importance of direct bacterial reduction and indirect bacterial reduction. Results indicate that in the environments tested, the majority of the reduced iron found results from indirect reduction mediated by hydrogen sulfide, a result of dissolution and precipitation phenomena, or is a result of direct bacterial reduction using hydrogen as an electron donor. Direct iron reduction plays a minor role in carbon turnover in these environments.
1469514|Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) reduction rates are generally low in freshwater wetlands and are regulated by the scarce availability of the ion. Increased concentrations of this electron acceptor due to sulphur (S) pollution of groundwater and surface water may, however, lead to high SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction rates now regulated by the availability of appropriate electron donors. Due to variations in this availability, the response to S pollution (e.g. from surface water or groundwater) is expected to differ between soils. This hypothesis was tested in laboratory mesocosm experiments by comparing two wetland soil types with distinctly different humus profiles: a Hydromoder and a Rhizomull type. In the first type, expected to have a higher availability of degradable soil organic matter (SOM), SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> availability appeared to be rate limiting for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction. In the Rhizomull soils, in contrast, the electron acceptor did not limit SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction rates at higher concentrations. These differences in response could not, however, be attributed to differences in the various SOM fractions or in SOM densities. Eutrophication and free sulphide accumulation, two major biogeochemical problems caused by SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> pollution, occurred in both types. The absolute extent of phosphorus mobilisation was determined by the concentration of this element in the soil (C/P ratio), while the level of sulphide accumulation was governed by the concentration of dissolved iron in the pore water. It was therefore concluded that neither the humus profile nor the concentrations of different SOM fractions in the soils are reliable indicators for the sensitivity of wetland types to S pollution.
20456467|Phaeocystis is recognized both as a nuisance and as an ecologically important phytoplankton species. Its polymorphic life cycle with both colonial and flagellated cells causes many taxonomic problems. Sequence variation among 22 isolates representing a global distribution of the genus has been compared using three molecular markers. The ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) spacer is too conserved to resolve species. The most conserved 18S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) analysis suggests that an undescribed unicellular Phaeocystis sp. (isolate PLY559) is a sister taxon to the Mediterranean unicellular Phaeocystis jahnii; this clade branched prior to the divergence of all other Phaeocystis species, including the colonial ones. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region shows sufficient variation that some spatial population structure can be recovered, at least in P. antarctica. P. globosa and P. pouchetii have multiple different ITS copies, suggestive of cryptic species that are still able to hybridize. A molecular clock has been constructed that estimates the divergence of the cold water colonial forms from the warm-water colonial forms to be about 30 Ma and the divergence of P. antarctica and P. pouchetii to be about 15 Ma. A short description of the colonial stage and the flagellated stage for each formally recognized species is provided. Morphological information is also provided on a number of undescribed species. These include the strain Ply 559, consisting of non-colonial cells with peculiar tubular extrusomes, a second non-colonial species from the north western Mediterranean Sea producing a lot of mucus, and a colonial species with scale-less flagellates found in Italian waters. In addition, three flagellated morphotypes with scales different from those of P. antarctica were reported in the literature from Antarctic waters. The picture emerging from both molecular and morphological data is that the number of species in the genus is still underestimated and that cryptic or pseudocryptic diversity requires a sound assessment in future research of this genus. Based on all published observations, an emended description of the genus is provided.

20055185|This paper reviews the role of soil respiration in determining ecosystem carbon balance, and the conceptual basis for measuring and modeling soil respiration. We developed it to provide background and context for this special issue on soil respiration and to synthesize the presentations and discussions at the workshop. Soil respiration is the largest component of ecosystem respiration. Because autotrophic and heterotrophic activity belowground is controlled by substrate availability, soil respiration is strongly linked to plant metabolism, photosynthesis and litterfall. This link dominates both base rates and short-term fluctuations in soil respiration and suggests many roles for soil respiration as an indicator of ecosystem metabolism. However, the strong links between above and belowground processes complicate using soil respiration to understand changes in ecosystem carbon storage. Root and associated mycorrhizal respiration produce roughly half of soil respiration, with much of the remainder derived from decomposition of recently produced root and leaf litter. Changes in the carbon stored in the soil generally contribute little to soil respiration, but these changes, together with shifts in plant carbon allocation, determine ecosystem carbon storage belowground and its exchange with the atmosphere. Identifying the small signal from changes in large, slow carbon pools in flux dominated by decomposition of recent material and autotrophic and mycorrhizal respiration is a significant challenge. A mechanistic understanding of the belowground carbon cycle and of the response of different components to the environment will aid in identifying this signal. Our workshop identified information needs to help build that understanding: (1) the mechanisms that control the coupling of canopy and belowground processes; (2) the responses of root and heterotrophic respiration to environment; (3) plant carbon allocation patterns, particularly in different forest developmental stages, and in response to treatments (warming, CO, nitrogen additions); and (4) coupling measurements of soil respiration with aboveground processes and changes in soil carbon. Multi-factor experiments need to be sufficiently long to allow the systems to adjust to the treatments. New technologies will be necessary to reduce uncertainty in estimates of carbon allocation, soil carbon pool sizes, and different responses of roots and microbes to environmental conditions.
1468942|The possibility for accumulation of hydrogen sulphide gas in roots of mangroves (Avicennia spp) which had colonized reclaimed coastal areas in Singapore was investigated using a simple potentiometric technique preceded by an extraction step. The study showed that detectable amounts of hydrogen sulphide gas were present in the underground cable roots of the mangroves and that the concentrations increased with the age of the plant. Furthermore concentrations of hydrogen sulphide in the roots were 30-40 times higher than the concentrations of the gas which were simultaneously generated by anaerobic processes in the surrounding, ageing mangrove sediment. The reasons for these patterns and their possible impact on the succession of Avicennia spp by a different type of mangrove, Rhizophora spp, are discussed.

41490418|Denitrification, N-fixation, and dissolved inorganic and organic fluxes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were measured in each of the major benthic habitat types of a shallow oligotrophic subtropical coastal system, and N and P budgets were constructed to quantify the importance of each habitat to N and P cycling in the whole ecosystem. The productivity/respiration (p/r) ratio (trophic status) of the habitats was an important control on the rates, direction (uptake, efflux) and composition (dissolved inorganic N (DIN), dissolved organic N (DON), N) of N fluxes across the sediment-water interface, with an efflux below p/r = 1.5 and an uptake above p/r = 1.5. The Zostera Seagrass Community was the most important habitat for  loss via net N effluxes (denitrification; 48%). Denitrification rates in seagrass were higher than those previously measured in temperate regions, most likely due to greater availability of NH for coupled nitrification-denitrification. Yabby Shoals (sub-tidal shoals inhabited by burrowing shrimp, Trypaea australiensis) accounted for the second largest loss of N via denitrification, the largest recycling of DIN and dissolved inorganic P (DIP; statistically significant only during the dark in summer) across the sediment-water interface and the second largest uptake of DON (statistically significant only in summer). This study highlighted that shallow subtropical coastal systems have a complex mosaic of benthic habitats and that some less 'iconic' habitats (i.e. non-seagrass) also make an important functional contribution that controls the flow of N and P through the whole ecosystem.
1469056| In the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, precipitation and soil nitrogen vary greatly between northwestern tallgrass areas and southeastern shortgrass areas, with the tallgrass having higher total precipitation and lower soil fertility. We used a model of grassland productivity, carbon/nitrogen cycling, and abiotic factors to test the hypothesis that tallgrass productivity is limited primarily by nitrogen availability while shortgrass productivity is limited by water. Under observed grazing intensities and ungrazed conditions, precipitation exerted primary control over grassland productivity for both regions, with differences in soil texture mediating soil water availability to the grasses. Mineral nitrogen availability interacted with water availability to influence productivity at precipitation levels  130% of the mean. Nitrogen mineralization and precipitation were positively related for each grassland type, however, nitrification varied both between grassland types and between grazed and ungrazed conditions. Combined mineralization and nitrification could not maintain soil mineral nitrogen levels in the face of plant nitrogen uptake stimulated by increased precipitation, thus providing the mechanism by which nitrogen becomes a secondary limiting factor for both grasslands. Model experiments indicated that the pattern of primary limitation by precipitation and secondary limitation by nitrogen was robust to model assumptions concerning ungulate deposition of urine and dung nitrogen to the soil. 
20055177|Free-living marine bacteria isolated from oligotrophic Mediterranean waters were enriched in culture to characterize their phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Odd chain iso- and anteiso-FAMEs and n--16:0 were the predominant structural PLFAs, together with a homologous series identified as mid-chain methoxy FAMEs. The dominant methoxy fatty acids identified were 9-CHO-15:0, 9-CH-16:0 and 11-CHO-17:0, occuring as pairs of stereoimers. Methoxy fatty acids accounted for up to 37% of PLFAs of free-living bacteria, which sets them as promising new biomarkers for bacteria of oligotrophic waters. Although similar homologues have already been characterized in a variety of eukaryotes and prokaryotes, methoxy fatty acids are identified here for the first time in marine bacteria. Analytical difficulties that may hinder the characterization of these biomarkers are presented, and structural elucidation keys by gas chromotography coupled to mass spectrometry are discussed. Whilst bacterial branched fatty acids were transferred to storage lipids of bacterivorous flagellates methoxy acids were not transferred to higher trophic levels in the studied conditions.
20456389|The study focuses on the response of a sulphate rich lowland river (River Spree) to a further increase in sulphate concentration as a result of mining activities in its catchments. It was hypothesized that riverine sediments could be conservative against an increase in sulphate concentration relating to both the intensity of sulphate reduction and the accompanying P mobilization. The usually lower amount of organic matter, compared to lakes or wetlands, and the high contents of iron oxides in the Spree sediment from discharged mining waters should counteract an enhanced P mobilization. Three short-term incubation experiments were carried out to test the sensitivity of different sediment horizons (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm), the influence of temperature (5 and 25 C) and the effect of a rising sulphate concentration (2.6-7.8 mM) on P mobilization rates (PMR) and sulphate reduction rates (SRR). Contrary to our initial hypothesis sulphate played a key role for P mobilization in riverine sediments because (1) all sulphate treated horizons showed a significant increase in pore water P concentrations, (2) increasing sulphate concentrations led to rising SRR and PMR, (3) the highest response on sulphate-mediated P mobilization was observed by a temperature enhancement of 20 C. PMR increased one order of magnitude at all tested sulphate concentrations, but these increases in PMR only slightly effected the P concentrations in the overlying water. In conclusions, an increase of internal P load is only expected in case of doubling the recent in situ sulphate concentrations, but extended warm periods as an effect of climate change or increasing temperature, respectively, could be of more importance.
40343553|N and P budgets quantify inputs and outputs of nutrients at the catchment scale to allow evaluation of inputs and outputs as well as inferences about transport and processing based on unaccounted-for nutrients. N and P budgets were constructed for two catchments in southeastern Michigan with markedly different numbers of impoundments, over two years, to evaluate the influence of impoundments on nutrient fluxes from each catchment. The Huron, with 88 impoundments > 10ha, stored 156 kg P km y, while the Raisin (with 14 impoundments) had a net export of 102 kg P km y. The Huron catchment also stored and denitrified more N than the Raisin catchment -2,418 kg N km y compared to 1,538 kg N km y. Riverine export of N and P also varied markedly between the catchments, with the Huron River exporting 288 kg N and 7 kg P km y and the Raisin River exporting 1,268 kg N and 34 kg P km y. We then re-calculated budget results from previous studies using the approach of the present study, altering input and outputs fluxes as well as system boundaries to obtain comparable budgets. For these comparable budgets, annual P outputs on average accounted for 77% of inputs whereas N outputs accounted for only 39% of N inputs. Across catchments, the percent of inputs exported by the river averaged 16% for N and 5% for P, indicating more effective retention of P than N.
20055158|We evaluated the P sources (point, diffuse), through a nested watershed approach investigating the Blaise (607 km), dominated by livestock farming, the Grand Morin (1202 km), dominated by crop farming, and the Marne (12,762 km), influenced by both agriculture and urbanization. Fertilizers account for the main P inputs (&gt60%) to the soils. An agricultural P surplus (0.5-8 kg P
41490474|Severe wildfire may cause long-term changes in the soil-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide and methane, two gases known to force atmospheric warming. We examined the effect of a severe wildfire 10 years after burning to determine decadal-scale changes in soil gas fluxes following fire, and explored mechanisms responsible for these dynamics. We compared soil carbon dioxide efflux, methane uptake, soil temperature, soil water content, soil horizon mass, fine root mass, and microbial biomass between a burned site and an unburned site that had similar stand conditions to the burned site before the fire. Compared to the unburned site, soil carbon dioxide efflux was 40% lower and methane uptake was 49% higher at the burned site over the 427-day measurement period. Soil O horizon mass, microbial biomass, fine root mass, and surface soil water content were lower at the burned site than the unburned site, but soil temperature was higher. A regression model showed soil carbon dioxide efflux was more sensitive to changes in soil temperature at the burned site than the unburned site. The relative importance of methane uptake to carbon dioxide efflux was higher at the burned site than the unburned site, but methane uptake compensated for only 1.5% of the warming potential of soil carbon dioxide efflux at the burned site. Our results suggest there was less carbon available at the burned site for respiration by plants and microbes, and the loss of the soil horizon increased methane uptake in soil at the burned site.
1469601|Three major reservoirs (Marne, Seine and Aube), situated in the upstream basin of the river Seine represent a storage capacity of 800 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. In order to quantify the possible role of these reservoirs as a sink or source of nutrients and organic matter for the river system, an input/output mass-balance of suspended matter, organic carbon, inorganic nitrogen forms, phosphorus and reactive silica was established, providing reliable estimates of their retention/elimination and export. The study was carried out over 3 years (1993, 1994 and 1995) in differing hydrological conditions. The retention times varied from 0.3 to 0.8 year, depending on the reservoir and the year, but was longer in 1993 that was a drier year than 1994 and 1995, hydrologically quite similar. Regarding retention (or elimination) and export, the behaviour of the three studied reservoirs was similar. A clear loss or retention of nitrogen, phosphorus and silica was observed in the reservoirs and represented about 40% of the incoming flux of nitrate, 50% of silica, and 60% of phosphate. The retention was lower for total phosphorus than for phosphate. The reservoirs are also sites of suspended matter deposition except during the decennial drawdown, when suspended matter is exported. For inorganic nitrogen, the average amount of nitrate retained in the Seine basin reservoirs upstream from Paris is 5000 tonnes y<sup>-1</sup> that is almost equal to the estimated retention by deposition or denitrification in river channel sediments for the whole drainage network. The retention in the reservoirs represents about 12% of the total flux of nitrate at the outlet of the basin upstream from Paris, and 5% at the mouth of the Seine River. We also calculated inlake C, N, P, Si budgets on the basis of direct process measurements. Measurements of planktonic primary and bacterial activity production led to annual net production of 4200 and 580 tonnes of carbon, respectively. A reasonable value (450 tonnes of carbon) of grazing was calculated. Corresponding N, P, Si fluxes were drawn from appropriate C:N:P:Si ratios. Benthic fluxes were measured with bell jars. The retention of P and Si represents a small fraction of important internal fluxes of phytoplanktonic uptake and recycling, while inorganic nitrogen retention depends mostly on benthic denitrification. The behaviour of P and Si differs in that P is mainly recycled in the water column, while Si dissolution occurs at the sediment interface. Nitrogen is recycled in both the planktonic and the benthic phase.
20456410|Bubble gas samples were collected at three different vegetation sites and two different depths (surface and 40 cm) in a natural wetland, Mizorogaike in Kyoto city, to investigate hydrogen concentration and D and C values of CH. Hydrogen concentration in bubble gas varied from 1 to 205 ppm, and that collected during summer was higher than that during winter. Bubble samples collected at 40 cm at sphagnum site usually showed the lowest H concentration among the samples collected at the three sites and two depths on the same day. The lowest H concentration observed at 40 cm at sphagnum site was similar to that expected for environmental water in which H producer and consumer need to assemble for free energy requirement.

1469978| Although the variation in natural <sup>15</sup>N abundance in plants and soils is well characterized, mechanisms controlling N isotopic composition of organic matter are still poorly understood. The primary goal of this study was to examine the role of NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization from ungulate urine patches in determining <sup>15</sup>N abundance in grassland plants and soil in Yellowstone National Park. We additionally used isotopic measurements to explore the pathways that plants in urine patches take up N. Plant, soil, and volatilized NH<sub>3</sub>  <sup>15</sup>N were measured on grassland plots for 10 days following the addition of simulated urine. Simulated urine increased <sup>15</sup>N of roots and soil and reduced <sup>15</sup>N of shoots. Soil enrichment was due to the volatilization of isotopically light NH<sub>3</sub>. Acid-trapped NH<sub>3</sub>  <sup>15</sup>N increased from -28 (day 1) to -0.3 (day 10), and was lighter than the original urea-N added (1.2). A mass balance analysis of urea-derived N assimilated by plants indicated that most of the N taken up by plants was in the form of ammonium through roots. However, isotope data also showed that shoots directly absorbed <sup>15</sup>N - depleted NH<sub>3</sub>-N that was volatilized from simulated urine patches. These results indicate that NH<sub>3</sub> volatilization from urine patches enriches grassland soil with <sup>15</sup>N and shoots are a sink for volatilized NH<sub>3</sub>, which likely leads to accelerated cycling of excreted N back to herbivores. 
1469412|Losses of dissolved nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, and SO<sub>4</sub>) in runoff were measured on grassland and shrubland plots in the Chihuahuan desert of southern New Mexico. Runoff began at a lower threshold of rainfall in shrublands than in grasslands, and the runoff coefficient averaged 18.6% in shrubland plots over a 7-year period. In contrast, grassland plots lost 5.0 to 6.3% of incident precipitation in runoff during a 5.5-year period. Nutrient losses from shrubland plots were greater than from grassland plots, with nitrogen losses averaging 0.33 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> vs 0.15 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, during a 3-year period. The greater nutrient losses in shrublands were due to higher runoff, rather than higher nutrient concentrations in runoff. In spite of these nutrient losses in runoff, all plots showed net accumulations of most elements due to inputs from atmospheric deposition. Therefore, loss of soil nutrients by hillslope runoff cannot, by itself, account for the depletion of soil fertility associated with desertification in the Chihuahuan desert.
25652604|Phosphorus (P) is often a limiting factor of forest growth but our knowledge of the processes governing P availability in forest soils is rather limited. In the present work, we combined a isotopic dilution method with extraction methods to evaluate the P status in Pinus pinaster plantation forests on highly P-deficient soils. Total, organic, and inorganic P, dissolved and diffusive P, i.e. ionic P species that can be transferred from the solid phase to the soil solution due a gradient of concentration, were determined to a soil depth of 120 cm in a gradient of 18 forest sites (seven humid sites, five mesic sites, and six dry sites). Our objective was to assess the potential contribution of organic and inorganic P to plant available P. Based on results and our original assumptions, we observed that the contribution of organic P fractions (mineralization of soil organic P) to P availability related to the contribution of inorganic P fractions (diffusive P for durations up to 1 year) was predominant in litter, less important in top soil horizons, and negligible at depths below 30 cm. This was partly due to a decreasing proportion of organic P and an increasing proportion of diffusive P with soil depth. Owing to a very low amount of diffusive P in the top soils in dry sites, the relative contribution of organic P was actually higher in these sites than in humid and mesic sites, despite a lower overall organic P fraction. The combination of extraction and isotopic dilution methods in our study shed new light on P status in this forest range. In particular, these methods enable assessment of both the size of the pools and their dynamic fractions.
24715105|The relative contributions of different anthropogenic and natural sources of in-stream nitrogen (N) cannot be directly measured at whole-watershed scales. Hence, source attribution estimates beyond the scale of small catchments must rely on models. Although such estimates have been accomplished using individual models, there has not yet been a comparison of N source attribution predictions at large spatial scales. We compared results from two models applied to the continental US: Nutrient Export from WaterSheds (NEWS) and SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watersheds (SPARROW). NEWS and SPARROW predictions for total N delivery to the US coastal zone were 373 and 429 kg N km year, respectively, for the contemporary period. Despite differences in how inputs were represented and defined by the models, NEWS and SPARROW both identified the same single-largest N sources for 67 % of the surface area that drains to the US coastal zone. When only anthropogenic sources were considered, agreement increased to 78 % of surface area. Fertilizer and crop N-fixation were dominant in the Mississippi River Basin, where the bulk of agricultural lands are located. Sewage and population-related sources were most important in urban areas and natural N (primarily N-fixation on non-agricultural land) was most important in the Pacific Northwest. Attribution to fertilizer plus crop N-fixation, atmospheric deposition, and sewage and population-related sources was generally greater by SPARROW than NEWS, and the reverse was true for manure and natural sources. Nonetheless, both models agreed in attributing 6281 % of N delivered to the coastal zone in the continental US to human activities.
1469401| Respiration and nitrogen mineralization rates of humus samples from 7 Scots pine stands located along a climatic transect across the European continent from the Pyrenees (4240) to northern Sweden (6608) were measured for 14 weeks under laboratory conditions at temperatures from 5 C to 25 C. The average Q<sub>10</sub> values for the respiration rate ranged from about 1.0 at the highest temperature to more than 5 at 10 C to 15 C in the northernmost samples. In samples from more northern sites, respiration rates remained approximately constant during the whole incubation period; in the southern end of the transect, rates decreased over time. Respiration rate was positively correlated with incubation temperature, soil pH and C:N ratio, and negatively with soil total N. Regressions using all these variables explained approximately 71% of the total variability in the respiration rate. There was no clear relation between the nitrogen mineralization rate and incubation temperature. Below 15 C the N-mineralization rate did not respond to increasing temperature; at higher temperatures, significant increases were found for samples from some sites. A regression model including incubation temperature, pH, N<sub>tot</sub> and C:N explained 73% of the total variability in N mineralization. The estimated increase in annual soil respiration rates due to predicted global warming at the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere ranged from approximately 0.07 10<sup>15</sup> to 0.13 10<sup>15</sup> g CO<sub>2</sub> at 2 C and 4 C temperature increase scenarios, respectively. Both values are greater than the current annual net carbon storage in northern forests, suggesting a switch of these ecosystems from net sinks to net sources of carbon with global warming. 
1469512| We studied five 20-m transects on the lower slope under tropical lower montane rain forest at 1900-2200 m above sea level. We collected samples of soil and of weekly rainfall, throughfall, litter leachate, and stream water between 14 March 1998 and 30 April 1999 and determined the concentrations of Al, total organic C (TOC), Ca, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, total N (TN), Na, P, S, and Zn. The soils were shallow Inceptisols; pH ranged 4.4-6.3 in the O horizons and 3.9-5.3 in the A horizons, total Ca (6.3-19.3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and Mg concentrations (1.4-5.4) in the O horizon were significantly different between the transects. Annual rainfall was 2193 mm; throughfall varied between 43 and 91% of rainfall, cloud water inputs were  3.3 mm a<sup>-1</sup> except for one transect (203). The volume-weighted mean pH was 5.3 in rainfall and 6.1-6.7 in throughfall. The median of the pH of litter leachate and stream water was 4.8-6.8 and 6.8, respectively. The concentrations of Ca and Mg in litter leachate and throughfall correlated significantly with those in the soil (r = 0.76-0.95). Element concentrations in throughfall were larger than in rainfall because of leaching from the leaves (Al, TOC, Ca, K, Mg), particulate dry deposition (Cu, Cl<sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N), and gaseous dry deposition (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N, total N, S). Net throughfall (= throughfall-rainfall deposition) was positive for most elements except for Mn, Na, and Zn. High-flow events were associated with elevated Al, TOC, Cu, Mn, and Zn concentrations. 
23359720|About a decade of dimethylsulphide (DMS) measurements in the North East Pacific are summarized and compared to model simulations. Bottle samples at various depths have been taken three times per year along Line P from the British Columbia coast to Ocean Station Papa (145 W, 50 N). Despite the long timeseries, DMS measurements are still sparse and the data show large variabilities in concentrations both spatially and temporally. DMS concentrations in late summer have been consistently high, while spring measurements at the offshore stations suggest a downward trend over the past years. Low values in spring, however, have also been recorded in the late 1990s, which might hint to interannual variability in the onset of the spring bloom and/or plankton assemblage rather than to a response to recent climate change. Some of the variability, both short-term and interannual, can be caused by regional or local preconditioning of the physical environment. The model simulations provide examples where periods of low winds, shallow mixed layers and sometimes high irradiance follow a mixing event and cause DMS peaks on various time scales as well as consistently elevated DMS concentrations for longer timeperiods. The model in its current configuration, which has been calibrated with measurements in the late 1990s/early 2000s, is not able to capture the low values in winter and spring observed in recent years. We suggest that this is due to missing or misrepresented links in the biogeochemical parameterizations of the model, e.g., an incomplete representation of variations in the phytoplankton assemblage. Including a seasonally varying S:N ratio to account for the absence of dinoflagellates in winter and spring significantly improves the simulation. Variability in DMS concentrations can also be induced by natural iron fertilization, which the model reproduces when timing is specified. For example, the model can reproduce the effects of natural volcanic Fe fertilization on surface water plankton dynamics and mixed layer DMS accumulation. The model also shows that the amplitude of the short term variability (days) increases when DMSP producing phytoplankton are less iron limited.

1469981| This study documents regional patterns in stream nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the Brazilian state of Rondnia in the southwestern Amazon basin, and interprets the patterns as functions of watershed soil properties, deforestation extent, and urban population density. The survey includes 77 different locations sampled in the dry and wet seasons, with a watershed size range from 1.8 to 33,000 km<sup>2</sup> over a total area of approximately 140,000 km<sup>2</sup>. A sequential regression technique is used to separate the effects of natural watersheds properties and anthropogenic disturbance on nutrients and chloride. Natural variation in soil texture explains most of the variance in stream nitrate concentrations, while deforestation extent and urban population density explain most of the variance in stream chloride (Cl) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations. Stream TDN, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), particulate phosphorus (PP) and Cl concentrations all increase non-linearly with deforestation extent in the dry season after controlling for natural variability due to soil type. Stream nutrient and Cl disturbances are observed only in watersheds more than 66-75% deforested (watershed area range 2-300 km<sup>2</sup>), suggesting stream nutrient concentrations are resistant to perturbation from vegetation conversion below a 66-75% threshold. In heavily deforested watersheds, stream Cl shows the largest changes in concentration (12  6 times forested background), followed by TDP (2.3  1.5), PP (1.9  0.8) and TDN (1.7  0.5). Wet season signals in Cl and TDP are diluted relative to the dry season, and no land use signal is observed in wet season TDN, PN, or PP. Stream TDN and TDP concentrations in non-urban watersheds both correlate with stream Cl, suggesting that sources other than vegetation and soil organic matter contribute to enhanced nutrient concentrations. Small, urbanized watersheds (5-20 km<sup>2</sup>) have up to 40 times the chloride and 10 times the TDN concentrations of forested catchments in the dry season. Several large watersheds ( 1000-3000 km<sup>2</sup>) with urban populations show higher Cl, TDN and TDP levels than any small pasture watershed, suggesting that human impacts on nutrient concentrations in large river systems may be dominated by urban areas. Anthropogenic disturbance of dry-season stream Cl and TDN is detectable in large streams draining deforested and urbanized watersheds up to 33,000 km<sup>2</sup>. We conclude that regional deforestation and urbanization result in changes in stream Cl, N and P concentrations at wide range of scales, from small pasture streams to large river systems. 
1469365|This study investigates the presence and concentration of light hydrocarbon gases in soil vapor located immediately above the capillary fringe of a petroleum-contaminated aquifer. A correlation was observed for the linear regression plot of redox potential versus detectable C<sub>2</sub>+C<sub>3</sub> alkane concentrations for a limited number of sampling points. C<sub>2</sub>+C<sub>3</sub> alkanes were not detected at points were redox potentials in groundwater exceeded -260 millivolts. The predominance of methanogenic processes in this redox range, as well as the observed C<sub>2</sub>+C<sub>3</sub> concentration ratios, suggest that ethane and propane gases in soil vapor may be biogenically produced as well as a result of volatilization from NAPL.
1468604|Decreases in pH and increases in the concentration of Al and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> have been observed in surface waters draining acid-sensitive regions in the northeastern U.S. during spring snowmelt. To assess the source of this acidity, we evaluated solute concentrations in snowpack, and in meltwater collected from snow and forest floor lysimeters in the west-central Adirondack Mountains of New York during the spring snowmelt period, 29 March through 15 April 1984. During the initial phase of snowmelt, ions were preferentially leached from the snowpack resulting in elevated concentrations in snowmelt water (e.g. H<sup>+</sup>=140  eq.l<sup>-1</sup>; NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>=123  eq.l<sup>-1</sup>; SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>=160  eq.l<sup>-1</sup>). Solute concentrations decreased dramatically within a few days of the initial melt (<latex>$<50\ \mu \text{eq}.\text{l}^{-1}$</latex>). The concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in snowpack and snowmelt water were similar, whereas NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in the forest floor leachate was at least two times the concentration of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Study results suggest that the forest floor was a sink for snowmelt inputs of alkalinity, and a net source of H<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, K<sup>+</sup> and Al inputs to the mineral soil. The forest floor was relatively conservative with respect to snowmelt inputs of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>. These results indicate that mineralization of N, followed by nitrification in the forest floor may be an important process contributing to elevated concentrations of H<sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in streams during the snowmelt period.
1469232|As gas phase atmospheric ammonia reacts with acidic aerosol particles it affects the chemical, physical, and optical properties of the particles. A knowledge of the source strengths of NH<sub>3</sub> is useful in determining the effect of NH<sub>3</sub> on aerosol properties on a regional basis. Here, an attempt is made to determine the direction and magnitude of the air/sea flux of ammonia for the North Atlantic Basin from both measured and modeled seawater and atmospheric ammonia concentrations. Previously reported measured seawater concentrations range from less than 30 to 4600 nM with the highest concentrations reported for the Caribbean Sea, the North Sea, and the Belgium coast. Measured atmospheric ammonia concentrations range from 2 to 500 nmol m<sup>-3</sup> with the largest values occurring over the Sargasso Sea, the Caribbean Sea, and the North Sea. For comparison to the measurements, seawater ammonia concentrations were calculated by the Hamburg Model of the Ocean Carbon Cycle (HAMOCC3). HAMOCC3 open ocean values agree well with the limited number of reported measured concentrations. Calculated coastal values are lower than those measured, however, due to the coarse resolution of the model. Atmospheric ammonia concentrations were calculated by the Acid Deposition Model of the Meterological Synthesizing Center (MSC-W) and by the global 3-dimensional model Moguntia. The two models predict similar annually averaged values but are about an order of magnitude lower than the measured concentrations. Over the North Sea and the NE Atlantic, the direction and magnitude of the air/sea ammonia flux calculated from MSC-W and Moguntia agree within the uncertainty of the calculations. Flux estimates derived from measured data are larger in both the positive and negative direction than the model derived values. The discrepancies between the measured and modeled concentrations and fluxes may be a result of sampling artifacts, inadequate chemistry and transport schemes in the models, or the difficulty in comparing point measurements to time-averaged model values. Sensitivity tests were performed which indicate that, over the range of values expected for the North Atlantic, the accuracy of the calculated flux depends strongly on seawater and atmospheric ammonia concentrations. Clearly, simultaneous and accurate measurements of seawater and atmospheric ammonia concentrations are needed to reduce the uncertainty of the flux calculations, validate the model results, and characterize the role of oceanic ammonia emissions in aerosol processing and nitrogen cycling for the North Atlantic.
1468956| The effect of soil heat and autoclaving on labile inorganic P (Bray I), microbial P (P-flush) and on phosphatase activity was studied by heating five forest soils in the laboratory, which simulated the effects of heat during bushfires. Top soil was heated to 60 C, 120 C and 250 C or autoclaved for 30 minutes. Soils were analysed immediately after heating and during seven months of incubation to assess immediate and longer-term effects of heating. Labile inorganic P increased immediately after heating and autoclaving soils, with the highest amount recorded for the 250 C treatment. Phosphorus associated with microbial biomass decreased with heat, and none or small amounts were detected in soils heated to 250 C and autoclaved, because high temperatures killed the microbial population. Most of the P released from microbes acted as a source of labile inorganic P in soils low in inorganic P, and some of the released P was fixed by the soil. In one soil high in inorganic labile P and with undetectable amounts of microbial-P, the increase in Bray P on heating could only be assigned to solubilisation of other sources of total P. Because high temperatures denature enzymatic proteins, phosphatase activity diminished with the increase in temperature, and no activity was detected in 250 C and autoclaved soils. Phosphorus released by heating decreased during incubation in three of the five soils studied, approaching values observed in unheated soils. Simultaneously, an increase in microbial P was observed in these heated soils, indicating that the partial recovery of microbial biomass acted as a sink for the decrease in Bray-P measured. Phosphatase activity recovered only partially during incubation of heated soils. 
1468997| Concerns about a possible feedback effect on global warming following possible increased emissions of methane from tundra environments have lead to series of methane flux studies of northern wetland/tundra environments. Most of these studies have been carried out in boreal sub-Arctic regions using different techniques and means of assessing representativeness of the tundra. Here are reported a time series of CH<sub>4</sub> flux measurements from a true Arctic tundra site. A total of 528 independent observations were made at 22 fixed sites during the summers of 1991 and 1992. The data are fully comparable to the most extensive dataset yet produced on methane emissions from sub-Arctic tundra-like environments. Based on the data presented, from a thaw-season with approximately 55% of normal precipitation, a global tundra CH<sub>4</sub> source of 18-30 Tg CH<sub>4</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> is estimated. This is within the range of 42  26 Tg CH<sub>4</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> found in a similar sub-Arctic tundra environment. No single-parameter relationship between one environmental factor and CH<sub>4</sub> flux covering all sites was found. This is also in line with conclusions drawn in the sub-Arctic. However, inter-season variations in CH<sub>4</sub> flux at dry sites were largely controlled by the position of the water table, while flux from wetter sites seemed mainly to be controlled by soil temperature. 
40343517|This paper represents the first continuous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) record, measured in a stream draining an Atlantic blanket bog in South West Ireland for the calendar year 2007. At 30-min intervals, the DOC concentration was automatically measured using an in-stream spectroanalyser whose variation compared well with laboratory analysed samples taken by a 24-bottle auto-sampler. The concentration of DOC ranged from 2.7 to 11.5 mg L1 with higher values during the summer and lower values during the winter. A simple linear regression model of DOC concentration versus air temperature of the previous day was found, suggesting that temperature more than discharge was controlling the DOC concentration in the stream. The change in DOC concentration with storm events showed two patterns: (1) in the colder period: the DOC concentration seemed to be independent of changes in stream flow; (2) in the warmer period: the DOC concentration was found to rise with increases in stream flow on some occasions and to decrease with increasing stream flow on other occasions. The annual export of DOC for 2007 was 14.1 ( 1.5) g C m2 . This value was calculated using stream discharge data that were determined by continuously recorded measurements of stream height. The flux of DOC calculated with the 30-min sampling was compared with that calculated based on lower sampling frequencies. We found that sampling frequency of weekly or monthly were adequate to calculate the annual flux of DOC in our study site in 2007.
25652595|In the upper Amazon basin, podzolisation involves the remobilization of large amounts of organic matter and chemical elements (Fe, Al, Si) previously accumulated in lateritic formations. In order to better understand the fate of organic matter in podzolic environments in this area, the evolution of lipid abundance and molecular composition were studied along a representative soil sequence showing the transition between a latosol and a well-developed podzol. Total solvent extracts were obtained from eight key soil samples from three profiles and their overlying litters, and enable us to follow both lateral and vertical evolutions. Lipid composition was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Major compound classes include alkanes, alkanones, alkanols, alkanoic acids, -hydroxyacids, as well as aromatics, steroids and triterpenoids. Free lipids do not accumulate in the early stages of podzolisation but are abundant in well-developed podzolic horizons, possibly due to (i) combined acidity and waterlogging, (ii) limited amounts of complexing elements, (iii) a decreased microbial activity. The evolution of lipid composition is consistent with podzolisation mechanisms previously highlighted in the sequence. This paper provides further evidence for the occurrence of anoxic conditions in deep water-logged podzolic horizons. It also shows that aromatic, phytotoxic compounds are stabilized in the well-developed podzol. This may play a role in the vegetation changes associated with podzolisation in the area.
41490549|This study aimed at tracing and quantifying organic carbon and total nitrogen fluxes related to suspended material in irrigation water in the uplands of northwest Vietnam. In the study area, a reservoir acts as a sink for sediments from the surrounding mountains, feeding irrigation channels to irrigate lowland paddy systems. A flow separation identified the flow components of overland flow, water release from the reservoir to the irrigation channel, direct precipitation into the channel, irrigation discharge to paddy fields and discharge leaving the sub-watershed. A mixed effects model was used to assess the C and N loads of each flow component. Irrigation water had an average baseline concentration of 29  4.4 mg 1 inorganic C, 4.7  1.2 mg 1 organic C and 3.9  1.6 mg 1 total N. Once soils were rewetted and overland flow was induced, organic C and total N concentrations changed rapidly due to increasing sediment loads in the irrigation water. Summarizing all monitored events, overland flow was estimated to convey about 63 kg organic C ha and 8.5 kg N ha from surrounding upland fields to the irrigation channel. The drainage of various nonpoint sources towards the irrigation channel was supported by the variation of the estimated organic C/total N ratios of the overland flow which fluctuated between 2 and 7. Nevertheless, the majority of the nutrient loads (up to 9399%) were derived from the reservoir, which served as a sediment-buffer trap. Due to the overall high nutrient and sediment content of the reservoir water used for irrigation, a significant proportion of nutrients was continuously reallocated to the paddy fields in the lowland throughout the rice cropping season. The cumulative amount of organic C and total N load entering paddies with the irrigation water between May and September was estimated at 0.8 and 0.7 Mg ha, respectively. Therefore deposition of C and N through irrigation is an important contributor in maintaining soil fertility, and a process to be taken into account in the soil fertility management in these paddy rice systems.
20456495|Daily community rates of calcification, photosynthesis and respiration were measured on a coral reef located in the Northern Red Sea, Gulf of Eilat, Israel between March 2000 and March 2002. This reef is exposed to seasonally varying levels of inorganic nutrient loading due to mixing and stratification of the adjacent open sea water column. Net production measurements were positively and linearly correlated with open sea nurient levels, and the community photosynthesis to respiration ratio varied between 0.9 and 1.7 accordingly. Community calcification varied between 30  20 and 60  20 mmol C m day during summer and winter, respectively. Under increased nutrient loading the relation between community calcification and aragonite saturation state is suppressed by 30% on average. Both of these findings demonstrate the deleterious effects of nutrient loading on coral reefs.
1469373|Soil organic carbon (SOC) has been identified as the main global terrestrial carbon reservoir, but considerable uncertainty remains as to regional SOC variability and the distribution of C between vegetation and soil. We used gridded forest soil data (8-km  8-km) representative of Swiss forests in terms of climate and forest type distribution to analyse spatial patterns of mineral SOC stocks along gradients in the European Alps for the year 1993. At stand level, mean SOC stocks of 98 t C ha-1 (N = 168, coefficient of variation: 70%) were obtained for the entire mineral soil profile, 76 t C ha-1 (N = 137, CV: 50%) in 0-30 cm topsoil, and 62 t C ha-1 (N = 156, CV: 46%) in 0-20 cm topsoil. Extrapolating to national scale, we calculated contemporary SOC stocks of 110 Tg C (entire mineral soil, standard error: 6 Tg C), 87 Tg C (0-30 cm topsoil, standard error: 3.5 Tg C) and 70 Tg C (0-20 cm topsoil, standard error: 2.5 Tg C) for mineral soils of accessible Swiss forests (1.1399 Mha). According to our estimate, the 0-20 cm layers of mineral forest soils in Switzerland store about half of the C sequestered by forest trees (136 Tg C) and more than five times more than organic horizons (13.2 Tg C). At stand level, regression analyses on the entire data set yielded no strong climatic or topographic signature for forest SOC stocks in top (0-20 cm) and entire mineral soils across the Alps, despite the wide range of values of site parameters. Similarly, geostatistical analyses revealed no clear spatial trends for SOC in Switzerland at the scale of sampling. Using subsets, biotic, abiotic controls and categorial variables (forest type, region) explained nearly 60% of the SOC variability in topsoil mineral layers (0-20 cm) for broadleaf stands (N = 56), but only little of the variability in needleleaf stands (N = 91, R2=0.23 for topsoil layers). Considerable uncertainties remain in assessments of SOC stocks, due to unquantified errors in soil density and rock fraction, lack of data on within-site SOC variability and missing or poorly quantified environmental control parameters. Considering further spatial SOC variability, replicate pointwise soil sampling at 8-km  8-km resolution without organic horizons will thus hardly allow to detect changes in SOC stocks in strongly heterogeneous mountain landscapes.
1469273|The Orangi river is an important all-year source of water for wildlife in the northern part of the Serengeti National Park. At two points along the river in the Banagi area, tributaries draining the adit and tailings of the Kilimafeza mine impact the Orangi. The former Au-Cu mine is subject to occasional wet season flooding leading to the release of iron ochres from the adit and physical as well as chemical mobilization of tailings material. The unpolluted river chemistry is essentially Na-Ca-HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and well-buffered. Drainage waters from the tailings are characterized by low pH (2.3) and high concentration of sulphate (up to 3280 mg/l), aluminium (275 mg/l), arsenic (324 mg/l), copper (125 mg/l), iron (622 mg/l), lead (21 mg/l), manganese (65 mg/l), and zinc (126 mg/l). Adit-drainage waters are typically of a lower pH (4.6) and have a lower concentration of sulphate (up to 1840 mg/l) and metals (up to 25 mg/l Al, 92 mg/l As, 42 mg/l Cu, 258 mg/l Fe, 9.6 mg/l Pb, 53 mg/l Mn, and 102 mg/l Zn). Mixing of these acidic waters with the alkaline river leads to rapid metal precipitation as Fe-ochre coatings on clastic sediment. This effect is more noticeable in the dry season. Consequently, although the tributaries draining the two sources are heavily contaminated, the effective buffering of the mine drainage waters restricts any potential pollution to within 1 km of the mine workings. Faecal coliforms show an antipathetic relationship to low pH and high metal conditions. The only mobile metals in the water outside this area are Mn and Zn and their contamination can be biologically monitored using a protozoan-based bioassay.
1468689|Resistivity and water level measurements were made on a barrier island on the south shore of Long Island, New York to examine the distribution of fresh groundwater and the potential for recirculation of saline groundwater. The depth to the base of the freshwater lens was overpredicted by calculations of the static-equilibrium depth to a sharp interface apparently because of the sensitivity of the calculation to the low water-table elevations which are in turn sensitive to variations in sea level because of the existence of a transition zone between fresh and saline groundwater. Mixing and recirculation of saline groundwater at the base of the lens produced a transition zone up to 9.65 m thick. Measurements also support model forecasts of a mean bay level several centimeters above sea level, augmented by atmospheric forcing and wave setup. A time lag of about 8 hours between the response of the ocean level to longshore winds and the corresponding response of the bay level can result in a difference in elevation between the bay and the ocean that is up to four times that produced by other agents such as Stokes transport and density differences. In the presence of differential hydraulic head, bay and ocean water may be exchanged via groundwater flow between the base of the freshwater lens under the barrier beach and a deeper clay layer.
23359753|In response to decreasing atmospheric emissions of sulfur (S) since the 1970s there has been a concomitant decrease in S deposition to watersheds in the Northeastern U.S. Previous study at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH (USA) using chemical and isotopic analyzes ( ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{34}{\mathrm{S}}_{\mathrm{S}{\mathrm{O}}_{4}}$ ) combined with modeling has suggested that there is an internal source of S within these watersheds that results in a net loss of S via sulfate in drainage waters. The current study expands these previous investigations by the utilization of  18 O analyzes of precipitation sulfate and streamwater sulfate. Archived stream and bulk precipitation samples at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest from 19682004 were analyzed for stable oxygen isotope ratios of sulfate ( ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{S}{\mathrm{O}}_{4}}$ ). Overall decreasing temporal trends and seasonally low winter values of ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{\mathrm{S}{\mathrm{O}}_{4}}$ in bulk precipitation are most likely attributed to similar trends in precipitation ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}}$ values. Regional climate trends and changes in temperature control precipitation ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}}$ values that are reflected in the ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{4}}$ values of precipitation. The significant relationship between ambient temperature and the ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}}$ values of precipitation is shown from a nearby site in Ottawa, Ontario (Canada). Although streamwater ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{4}}$ values did not reveal temporal trends, a large difference between precipitation and streamwater ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{4}}$ values suggest the importance of internal cycling of S especially through the large organic S pool and the concomitant effect on the ${\mathrm{\delta }}^{18}{\mathrm{O}}_{{\mathrm{S}\mathrm{O}}_{4}}$ values in drainage waters.
1468490| The role of rhodanese as an intermediate catalyst in the oxidation of elemental S (S<sup></sup>) is not well understood. This study investigated the effect of 26 soil properties and steam sterilization in relation to S<sup></sup> oxidation and rhodanese activity in 33 soils (27 Oregon soils and six Chinese soils). S<sup></sup> oxidation potential was determined by incubating (7 d at 23 C) soil amended with 500 mg S<sup></sup> kg<sup>-1</sup> soil and measuring the SO<sub>4</sub> released. Both total S<sup></sup> oxidation (TSO) and rhodanese activity varied widely among the 33 soils, ranging from 0 to 143 mg SO<sub>4</sub>-S kg<sup>-1</sup> soil 7 d<sup>-1</sup> and 22 to 2109 nmoles SCN<sup>-</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> soil h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. S<sup></sup> oxidation but not rhodanese activity had a significant positive correlation with soil pH. In sterile soils, chemical S<sup></sup> oxidation (CSO) averaged 3% of the total S<sup></sup> oxidation and apparent rhodanese activity averaged 11% of the total rhodanese activity. S<sup></sup> oxidation was not significantly correlated with rhodanese activity. However, development of stepwise regression models predicting S<sup></sup> oxidation revealed that rhodanese activity was an important explanatory variable in predicting biological S<sup></sup> oxidation (TSO minus CSO). Also, microbial biomass C was found to be an important parameter in models for both S<sup></sup> oxidation and rhodanese activity. Investigations of the effect of acidification during S<sup></sup> oxidation showed that biological S<sup></sup> oxidation was negatively correlated with S<sup></sup> oxidation-induced-pH-change for soils with pH  6 but no such significant relationship was found on soils with pH > 6. This suggested that extreme acidity may inhibit S<sup></sup> oxidation but not rhodanese activity. 
41410549|Urbanization impacts fluvial systems via a combination of changes in sediment chemistry and basin hydrology. While chemical changes in urban soils have been well characterized, similar surveys of riparian sediments in urbanized areas are rare. Metal concentrations were measured in sediments collected from riparian areas across the urbanization gradient in Baltimore, MD. Average metal concentrations are similar to those observed in other regional studies. Two important spatial patterns are evident in the data. First, calcium concentrations double across the urbanization gradient, regardless of changes in underlying geochemistry at the boundary between the Eastern US Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Alkali-earth metal ratios indicate that the additional Ca is very pure and possibly arises from cement common to urban systems. Second, hot spots of trace metals typically associated with urban systems (e. g., Cu, Zn, and Pb) occur in areas that have been artificially filled to create additional real estate in high land value areas. Together, these data indicate that riparian sediments exhibit unexpected patterns of metal contamination. If these sediments are remobilized, during events such as droughts or floods, this contamination may perpetuate legacy impacts to ecosystem health from a history of fluvial contamination.
23359734|Nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) deposition, as well as altered soil moisture dynamics due to climate change can have large effects on fen meadow biogeochemistry and vegetation. Their combined effects may differ strongly from their separate effects, since each process affects different nutrients through different mechanisms. However, the impacts of these environmental problems are rarely studied in combination. We therefore investigated the separate and interactive effects of current levels of N- and S-deposition and changes in soil moisture dynamics on fen meadow vegetation. We focused on vegetation biomass and N:P stoichiometry, including access to soil P through root surface phosphatase activity, in a 3-year factorial addition experiment in an N-limited rich fen meadow in the Biebrza valley in Poland. We applied 29.5 kg N ha -1 year -1 and 32.1 kg S ha -1 year -1 , which correspond to current deposition levels in Western Europe. Changes in soil moisture dynamics due to climate change were mimicked by amplified drying of the soil in summer. This level of N-deposition had limited effects on plant biomass production in this rich fen, despite low foliar N:P ratios that suggest N limitation. This level of S-deposition, however, resulted in decreased vegetation P-uptake and biomass. We also showed that increased summer drought resulted in considerable increases in vegetation biomass. We found no interactive effects on vegetation biomass or N:P stoichiometry, possibly as a result of the limited main effects of the separate processes.
20456384|Base cation cycling was investigated on the Canadian Shield in a pristine catchment of the boreal forest. An input-output budget (atmospheric deposition -- stream exports) for the whole watershed indicated that nitrogen (N) was strongly retained, while sulphur (S) and base cations (K, Ca, Mg) were lost. The S losses are attributed to internal sources, such as SO desorption and/or mineralisation of soil organic-S. The base cation losses at the catchment scale, however, might be contributed by weathering of the till below the rooting zone, which has little ecological significance. For this reason, a detailed budget of basic cations, including atmospheric deposition, tree uptake, mineral weathering and leaching losses was constructed for the soil rooting zone of a stand representative of the forest covering the catchment. Different scenarios of tree uptake (whole tree and stem-only harvesting), weathering rates (PROFILE modelled values, PROFILE modelled values corrected for soil Na leaching) and soil leaching losses (depth of 22 and 81 cm) were considered. The element budgets were summed for the 1997-2003 (7 years) period. In every scenario, K was lost (-35.5 to -1.2 kg ha) from the exchangeable reservoir. Gain or losses of Ca were observable, depending of the scenario considered (28.8 to -20.1 kg ha) while Mg (-0.8 to 13.3 kg ha) generally accumulated over the 7-year period. The absolute K losses are very important, given the very small K soil exchangeable reservoir (55.2 kg ha) at the site. Because the amount of K sequestered in biomass (110 kg ha) is twice the amount found in the exchangeable soil reservoir, this forest is very sensitive to commercial forestry operations and forest harvesting appears as the main pathway of base cation losses. This raises important questions regarding the sustainability of the boreal forest that lies on K-poor soils of the Canadian Shield.
41490496|The main objective of this study was to evaluate dissolved organic and inorganic carbon dynamics along upstream and downstream reaches of the Acre River draining the city of Rio Branco, in the state of Acre, Brazil. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the Acre River were significantly higher during the wet season, ranging from 385  160 to 430  131 M among the stations, with no difference in upstream and downstream concentrations. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) showed an inverse pattern, with higher concentrations in the dry season, ranging from 816  215 to 998  754 M among the stations, as well as no difference in upstream and downstream DIC concentrations. Bicarbonate was the dominant DIC fraction and was mainly observed during the dry season. Due to lower pH values during the wet season, CO partial pressure (pCO) in the Acre River was higher in the wet season, with values ranging from 4,567  1,813 to 4,893  837 ppm among the stations. Our results indicate that, although the Acre River drains a large city with significant sewage disposal into the river, seasonal hydrological processes are the main driver of dissolved carbon dynamics, even in the downstream study reach directly influenced by urbanization.
1469953|The biogeochemical input-output fluxes of two forested catchments with contrasting levels of atmospheric deposition were investigated in Germany. This paper focuses on the effects of recent changes in atmospheric inputs on the chemical composition in the soil solution and stream. The catchment 'Schluchsee' (Black Forest; SW Germany) is characterized by relatively low atmospheric inputs whereas 'Rotherdbach' (Ore Mountains; E Germany) received significant amounts of acid deposition (mainly originating from SO<sub>2</sub> emissions) until recent years. Both sites reveal decreases in H<sup>+</sup> and S deposition during the 1990s. This pattern is typical when compared to trends in Europe. In response to the reduced S deposition, soil solution and streamwater SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations decreased significantly. A net release of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> (output > input) was observed at both sites due to the release of S previously stored in the soil. The level of N deposition was more or less constant at both sites. At Schluchsee, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration in streamwater remained more or less unchanged, whereas a decrease at Rotherdbach was observed. A recovery from acidification was found in seepage water as indicated by increasing acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). Streamwater ANC increased only in the permanently acidified Rotherdbach. No change of ANC was observed in the Schluchsee stream, which was characterized by episodic acidification during high-flow conditions. Nevertheless, the key factor controlling the recovery from surface water acidification was the type, amount and distribution of stored S pools in the ecosystem. Thus, time series analysis of long-term data of input-output chemistry can be a valuable instrument in order to improve the understanding of linked terrestrial-aquatic systems and give useful clues for modeling efforts.
1468852|Organic acids and inorganic chemistry were examined in seventeen seepage lakes, seven streams, and one seep in central Maine. The objectives of this analysis were to determine the quantity and quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and to assess the relationship between organic and inorganic surface water chemistry. Lakes and streams sampled were dilute (average conductivity of 20.3  S cm<sup>-1</sup>) with a wide range of DOC (125-2593  mol C L<sup>-1</sup>). Organic acids in DOC were evaluated by: -DOC fractionation (hydrophobic acids and neutrals, and hydrophilic acids, bases, and neutrals); -DOC isolation followed by FT-IR, base titration, and chemical analyses; -adsorption on solid phase extraction columns; and charge balance studies. All lakes and streams were dominated by hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids (60 to 92% of DOC). Lakes and streams with low DOC had low hydrophobic to hydrophilic acid ratios (ca 1.2-1.3), regardless of pH and acid neutralizing capacities (ANC), compared to lakes and streams with moderate to high DOC concentrations (ca 1.9-2.4). Based on FT-IR spectroscopy and chemical analysis, organic acids were found to be dominated by a strong carboxylic character. Titration data of isolated DOC allowed accurate prediction of organic anions, which were strongly pH dependent (organic anions ranged from 14 to 198  eq L<sup>-1</sup>). Exchange acidity averaged 11.3, 13.6, and 8.7  eq mg C<sup>-1</sup> for lake hydrophobic acids, lake hydrophilic acids, and stream hydrophobic acids, respectively. Overall evidence suggested that DOC and organic acid characteristics were related to their carboxylic functional group content and that the nature of these constituents was similar despite the source of origin (upland soils, wetlands, or Sphagnum deposits). Also, contact of soil leachates with B horizons seemed to be a controlling factor in DOC quantity and quality in the lakes and streams studied.
40343605|Black carbon (BC) is a quantitatively important C pool in the global C cycle due to its relative recalcitrance compared with other C pools. However, mechanisms of BC oxidation and accompanying molecular changes are largely unknown. In this study, the long-term dynamics in quality and quantity of BC were investigated in cultivated soil using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. BC particles and changes in BC stocks were obtained from soil collected in fields that were cleared from forest by fire at 8 different times in the past (2, 3, 5, 20, 30, 50, 80 and 100 years before sampling) in western Kenya. BC contents rapidly decreased from 12.7 to 3.8 mg C g soil during the first 30 years following deposition, after which they slowly decreased to a steady state at 3.5 mg C g soil. BC-derived C losses from the top 0.1 m over 100 years were estimated at 6,000 kg C ha. The initial rapid changes in BC stocks resulted in a mean residence time of only around 8.3 years, which was likely a function of both decomposition as well as transport processes. The molecular properties of BC changed more rapidly on surfaces than in the interior of BC particles and more rapidly during the first 30 years than during the following 70 years. The Oc/C ratios (Oc is O bound to C) and carbonyl groups (C=O) increased over the first 10 and 30 years by 133 and 192%, respectively, indicating oxidation was an important process controlling BC quality. A1, Si, polysaccharides, and to a lesser extent Fe were found on BC particle surfaces within the first few years after BC deposition to soil. The protection by physical and chemical stabilization was apparently sufficient to not only minimize decomposition below detection between 30 and 100 years after deposition, but also physical export by erosion and vertical transport below 0.1 m.
1468553|Stable isotopes of strontium provide a unique quantification of ecosystem processes because organisms do not differentiate between them. For landscapes with contrasting geologies, these isotopes can identify atmospheric source material from local weathered material. This study quantified the input of strontium, distribution within the ecosystem, canopy capture versus leaf leachate, canopy loss, and Sr increment in biomass from an atmospheric origin. Forest ecosystems were studied along an elevational gradient in New Mexico. Spruce forests had a much greater capacity for capturing atmospheric Sr than aspen forests; however, aspen contained more total atmospheric Sr in their tissues because of greater uptake rates and the ability to utilize atmospheric deposited Sr before the initiation of the aspen forest. This technique has excellent capabilities for estimating the relative importance of atmospheric and weathering inputs to certain ecosystems.
1468679| Methane flux measurements were made at four sites in a freshwater temperate swamp over the 13 month period of April 1985 through May 1986. Emissions were highly variable both between sites and over time at any one site. Ebullition from sediments was an important component of methane release. Although release of methane through bubbling occurred in only 19% of the measurements made between April and June 1985, when instrumentation allowed us to separate diffusive and bubble fluxes, ebullition accounted for 34% of the total flux during this period. Methane release rates showed a strong seasonal variation, with highest emission rates observed in early spring and again in late summer, which was associated with changes in plant growth and physiology. Emission rates were partially correlated with sediment temperature, but the relationship was not straightforward, and resembled a step function. Emissions responded strongly to temperature change through the range of 10-16C. At winter sediment temperatures between 4-9C, CH<sub>4</sub> flux continued at low rates (0-28 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>; average=7.9 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>) and appeared insensitive to changes in sediment temperature. Annual methane emission from three constantly flooded sites (mean water depth = 35 cm) was 43.7+/-7.8 g m<sup>-2</sup> (standard error); annual flux from a bank site was 41.4+/-20.5 g m<sup>-2</sup>. A comparison of flux measurements from fresh and saline wetlands in the immediate area of Newport News Swamp emphasizes the importance of edaphic factors in controlling flux. 
1469194|The short-term effect of a single fire, and the long-term effect of recent fire history and successional stage on total and mineral N concentration, net nitrogen mineralization, and nitrification were evaluated in soils from a steep semi-arid shrubland chronosequence in southeast Spain. A single fire significantly increased soil mineral N availability and net nitrification. Increasing fire frequency in the last few decades was associated with a sharp decrease in surface soil organic matter and total N concentrations and pools, and with changes in the long-term N dynamic patterns. The surface-soil extractable NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>: NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ratio increased throughout the chronosequence. All net mineralized N in laboratory incubations from all sites was converted to nitrate, suggesting that allelochemic inhibition of net nitrification is probably not important in this system. Net nitrification in samples during incubation increased through the sere. The maximum rate of net nitrification (k<sub>max</sub>) increased through the first three stages of the sere. A linear relationship was found between total soil N and N mineralization, and both k<sub>max</sub> and net nitrification for the first three stages of the sere, suggesting that total N and ammonification are likely to be the control mechanisms of nitrification within the sere. The oldest site exhibited the lowest specific k<sub>max</sub> and the highest potential soil respiration rate suggesting that a lower N quality and increasing competition for ammonium might also limit nitrification at least in the long-unburned garrigue site.
1469109|Reductions in the global stratospheric ozone layer are thought to be increasing the amount of ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation reaching the planet's surface and may be affecting the chemistry of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface waters. We studied the abundance of chromophores in DOC collected in four different aquatic environments in southwestern Nova Scotia using <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>13</sup>C NMR) spectroscopy. We showed a clear seasonal pattern in the distribution of structural carbon related to light-sensitive chromophores. There seemed to be little variation in the UV-B related chemical structure of DOC between lakes and streams, though water from a bog pool showed large differences from the other samples. These patterns of potential UV-B reactivity tend to be dampened however, by variations in DOC concentrations which also occur seasonally.
41490471|Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition is increasing rapidly in tropical regions, adding N to ecosystems that often have high background N availability. Tropical forests play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, yet the effects of N deposition on C cycling in these ecosystems are poorly understood. We used a field N-fertilization experiment in lower and upper elevation tropical rain forests in Puerto Rico to explore the responses of above- and belowground C pools to N addition. As expected, tree stem growth and litterfall productivity did not respond to N fertilization in either of these N-rich forests, indicating a lack of N limitation to net primary productivity (NPP). In contrast, soil C concentrations increased significantly with N fertilization in both forests, leading to larger C stocks in fertilized plots. However, different soil C pools responded to N fertilization differently. Labile (low density) soil fractions and live fine roots declined with fertilization, while mineral-associated soil in fertilized plots were correlated with smaller labile soil C pools in the lower elevation forest (R = 0.65, p < 0.05), and with lower live fine root biomass in the upper elevation forest (R = 0.90, p < 0.05). Our results indicate that soil storage is sensitive to N deposition in tropical forests, even where plant productivity is not N-limited. The mineral-associated soil pool has the potential to respond relatively quickly to N additions, and can drive increases in bulk soil stocks in tropical forests.
1468535|Total community, planktonic and benthic metabolisms were measured by using the carbon dioxide production and consumption, the 'diurnal curve' method and the in situ bottle incubation technique over an annual cycle in two sublagoons of the Saquarema Lagoon, Brazil. Metabolic rates of the phytoplankton-based lagoon were characterized by considerable daytime and daily variability in production and respiration, by a seasonal shift between net autotrophy and heterotrophy and by an annual balance of production (P=105 65 mmoles/m<sup>2</sup>/day, n = 25) and respiration (R=102 50 mmoles/m<sup>2</sup>/day, n = 25). Total community metabolism was similar throughout the lagoon, but phytoplankton assimilation rates and benthic respiration showed spatial differences. Bottle incubations compared to total community free water respiration suggested that the pelagic community was 2-5 times more active than the benthos.
1468909|The concentration of selected trace elements (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Se, and Zn) were analysed in soils, grass, bush, and tree samples from the Mole National Park, Ghana. The distribution of the essential nutrients: cobalt, copper, manganese, and selenium is controlled by bedrock geology, whereas iron, molybdenum, and zinc distribution is controlled by soil and hydrological processes. In the soils, iron, manganese, and cobalt are largely fixed in the mineral fraction while most of the copper, molybdenum, and selenium in the soils can be extracted by disodium ethylenediaminetetracetate. Copper, cobalt, and manganese appear to be preferentially concentrated in grass species while molybdenum and selenium are concentrated in browse plants. Variations in uptake exist between wet and dry seasons with all trace elements studied, except iron and manganese, showing a marked increased availability in the wet season and increased concentration in the residual fraction of the mineral and organic soils in the dry season. In the dry season the plant concentration of molybdenum and selenium decreased while copper and zine showed increased concentrations and this may be related to a lower pH of the groundwaters at this time. A budget of metal input and output in the ecosystem at Mole has been computed. From this potential dietary deficiencies in cobalt can be observed, however for other metals soil and plant concentrations are sufficient to prevent straightforward deficiencies while the concentrations of molybdenum and selenium are sufficiently low to be considered safe.
1469268| Calcite treatment of chronically acidic lakes has improved fish habitat, but the effects on downstream water quality have not previously been examined. In this study, the spatial and temporal effects of watershed CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment on the chemistry of a lake outlet stream in the Adirondack Mountains of New York were examined. Before CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment, the stream was chronically acidic. During spring snowmelt before treatment, pH and acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) in the outlet stream declined, and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al<sub>IM</sub>) concentrations increased sharply. During that summer, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations decreased downstream, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and ANC increased, in association with the seasonal increase in decomposition of organic matter and the attendant SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-reduction process. A charge-balance ANC calculation closely matched measured downstream changes in ANC in the summer and indicated that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction was the major process contributing to summer increases in ANC. Increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and ANC began immediately after CaCO<sub>3</sub> application, and within 3 months, exceeded their pretreatment values by more than 130 eq/L. Within 2 months after treatment, downstream decreases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, ANC, and pH, were noted. Stream mass balances between the lake and the sampling site 1.5 km downstream revealed that the transport of all chemical constituents was dominated by conservative mixing with tributaries and ground water, however, non-conservative processes resulted in significant Ca<sup>2+</sup> losses during the 13-month period after CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment. Comparison of substrate samples from the buffered outlet stream with those from its untreated tributaries showed that the percentage of cation-exchange sites occupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as well as non-exchangeable Ca, were higher in the outlet-stream substrate than in tributary-stream substrate. Mass-balance data for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, Al<sub>IM</sub>, and DOC revealed net downstream losses of these constituents and indicated that a reasonable set of hypothesized reactions involving Al<sub>IM</sub>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and DOC could have caused the measured changes in stream acid/base chemistry. In the summer, the sharp decrease in ANC continued despite significant downstream decreases in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations. After CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment, reduction of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was only a minor contributor to ANC changes relative to those caused by Ca<sup>2+</sup> dilution from acidic tributaries and acidic ground water, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> interactions with stream substrate. 
1468527|The seasonal change of the rates of production and emission of methane were determined under in-situ conditions in an Italian rice paddy in 1985 and 1986. The contribution to total emission of CH<sub>4</sub> of plant-mediated transport, ebullition, and diffusion through the flooding water was quantified by cutting the plants and by trapping emerging gas bubbles with funnels. Both production and emission of CH<sub>4</sub> increased during the season and reached a maximum in August. However, the numbers of methanogenic bacteria did not change. As the rice plants grew and the contribution of plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> emission increased, the percentage of the produced CH<sub>4</sub> which was reoxidized and thus, was not emitted, also increased. At its maximum, about 300 ml CH<sub>4</sub> were produced per m<sup>2</sup> per hour. However, only about 6% were emitted and this was by about 96% via plant-mediated transport. Radiotracer experiments showed that CH<sub>4</sub> was produced from H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> (30-50%) and from acetate. The pool concentration of acetate was in the range of 6 - 10 mM. The turnover time of acetate was 12 - 16 h. Part of the acetate pool appeared to be not available for production of CH<sub>4</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>.
1468895|Water samples from 36 lakes in northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were collected and analyzed during 1983-84. All study lakes were dilute and had total alkalinities of less than 150  eq L<sup>-1</sup>. Minnesota lakes have hydrologic inputs from the watershed and inputs of base cations derived from the watershed. Study lakes in Minnesota had higher total alkalinities, dissolved organic carbon, and noncarbonate alkalinity as a result of watershed inputs. Lakes in Michigan and Wisconsin were precipitation-dominated seepage lakes that have lower concentrations of base cations than lakes in Minnesota. All of the study lakes have lower sulfate concentrations than expected, based on atmospheric wet deposition and evapotranspiration. Pore water samples collected from one of the study lakes--Little Rock Lake--in Wisconsin were used to calculate diffusive fluxes between the sediment and water column. According to these calculations, the sediments were a source of total alkalinity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a sink for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The sediment-water exchange of total alkalinity, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> appears to be important in the whole-lake budgets of these ions for Little Rock Lake.
1469433| This study evaluated the effect of nutrient application on the regrowth dynamics of secondary fallow vegetation in an intensely exploited shifting cultivation area in the eastern Amazon region of Brazil. The importance of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S and a mixture of micro-nutrients was tested in a minus-one-trial by comparison with a full complement of nutrients and unfertilized control plots. Fertilizers were applied three times during the experiment and their effects were monitored over a period of 2 years. Prior to the second fertilization, one third of each experimental plot was cleared of the vegetation cover and planted in maize, prior to the third fertilizer application these subplots were planted in sorghum. Biomass of maize and sorghum were used to indicate nutrient constraints and fertilizing effects due to the different treatments. Both crops were limited by P- and N-availability, with greater responses to P. The initial fertilization did not affect the biomass accumulation of the secondary vegetation during the first 15 months, but two additional applications significantly increased biomass in the complete fertilizer treatment compared to the unfertilized control. Biomass accumulation was primarily P-limited, N-limitation was apparent but not significant. The remaining nutrients did not affect plant growth. Fertilization favored production of nutrient-rich leaves. Application of readily available nutrients gave grasses a competitive edge over slower reacting woody vegetation. Fertilization also caused significant shifts in the contribution of woody species to biomass accumulation, as could be demonstrated for two prominent pioneer tree species. Growth response to fertilization as well as the primary limiting nutrient varied among seven dominant species monitored in the secondary vegetation. We conclude that growth of tropical secondary vegetation can be nutrient limited and it might respond significantly to additional nutrients by increasing biomass production. 
40343628|Nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry of a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand subjected to an average total atmospheric N deposition of 48 kg ha year was studied during the period 1992-2007. The annual amount of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in throughfall (TF) averaged 34 kg ha year over the 16-year monitoring period. The throughfall fluxes contained also considerable amounts of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) (5-8.5 kg N ha year), which should be incorporated in the estimate of N flux using throughfall collectors. Throughfall DIN fluxes declined at a rate of -0.9 kg N ha year, mainly due to the decreasing TF fluxes of ammonium (NH), which accounted for 70% to TF DIN. The decrease in TF DIN was accompanied by a decrease in DIN leaching in the seepage water (1.6 kg N ha year), which occurred exclusively as nitrate (NO). Nitrate losses in the leachate of the forest floor (LFH) equalled the TF NO delivered to the LFH-layer. On the contrary, about half of the TF NH was retained within the LFH-layer. Approximately 60% of the TF DIN fluxes were leached indicating that N inputs were far in excess of the N requirements of the forest. For DON, losses were only substantial from the LFH-layer, but no DON was leached in the seepage water. Despite the high N losses through nitrate leaching and <tex-math>${\rm{NO}}_x $</tex-math> emission, the forest was still accumulating N, especially in the aggrading LFH-layer. The forest stand, on the contrary, was found to be a poor N sink.
24715339|Intensive agriculture has the potential to reduce soil carbon stocks in the years following initial cultivation, although the magnitude and direction of the effect can vary with ecosystem and management factors. Agriculture can also shift the carbon chemistry of soils via changes in crop plant chemistry, decomposition, and/or soil amendments [e.g. black carbon (i.e. charcoal)]. It is possible that soil carbon levels can recover if intensive cultivation ends, but the factors driving the extent and quality of this recovery are not well understood. Here, we examined soil carbon pool sizes and carbon chemistry >200 years after intensive cultivation by early Hawaiians. We compared soils from an extensive pre-European-contact agricultural field system with reference sites under similar modern management. Sites were selected along a climate and soil weathering gradient to investigate interactions between historic land use and ecosystem properties, such as soil mineralogy, in driving soil carbon recovery. Soil carbon content was measured from 0 to 30 cm depth, and carbon chemistry was assessed using C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Overall, we found significantly lower soil carbon stocks in pre-contact agricultural sites compared to reference sites. Radiocarbon dating of bulk soil carbon showed a trend toward older carbon in agricultural versus reference soils, suggesting decreased retention of newer C in agricultural sites. Radiocarbon dating of macroscopic charcoal particles from under agricultural field walls indicated that there were black carbon inputs concurrent with pre-contact agricultural activity. Nonetheless, black carbon and carbonyl carbon levels were lower in agricultural versus reference soils, suggesting decreased retention of specific carbon groups in cultivated sites. Proteins were the only biomolecule higher in abundance in agricultural versus reference sites. Finally, there was an interacting effect of soil mineralogy and historic land use on soil carbon stocks. Whereas short range order (SRO) minerals were positively associated with total soil carbon overall, differences in soil carbon between agricultural and reference soils were largest in soils with high concentrations of SRO minerals. Our results indicate that the negative effect of agriculture on soil carbon stocks can be long-lived, may be associated with persistent changes in soil carbon chemistry, and can vary with soil mineralogical properties.
41490450|Phosphorus is widely considered to constrain primary productivity in tropical rain forests, yet the chemistry of soil organic phosphorus in such ecosystems remains poorly understood. We assessed the composition of soil organic phosphorus in 19 contrasting soils under lowland tropical forest in the Republic of Panama using NaOH-EDTA extraction and solution P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The soils spanned a strong rainfall gradient (1730-3404 mm y) and contained a wide range of chemical properties (pH 3.3-7.0; total carbon 2.8-10.4%; total phosphorus 74-1650 mg P kg). Soil organic phosphorus concentrations ranged between 22 and 494 mg P kg and were correlated positively with total soil phosphorus, pH, and total carbon, but not with annual rainfall. Organic phosphorus constituted 26  1%(mean  STDerror, n = 19) of the total phosphorus, suggesting that this represents a broad emergent property of tropical forest soils. Organic phosphorus occurred mainly as phosphate monoesters (68-96% of total organic phosphorus) with smaller concentrations of phosphate diesters in the form of DNA (4-32% of total organic phosphorus). Phosphonates, which contain a direct carbon-phosphorus bond, were detected in only two soils (3% of the organic phosphorus), while pyrophosphate, an inorganic polyphosphate with a chain length of two, was detected in all soils at concentrations up to 13 mg P kg (3-13% of extracted inorganic phosphorus). Phosphate monoesters were a greater proportion of the total organic phosphorus in neutral soils with high concentrations of phosphorus and organic matter, whereas the proportion of phosphate diesters was greater in very acidic soils low in phosphorus and organic matter. Most soils did not contain detectable concentrations of either myo-or scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate, which is in marked contrast to many temperate mineral soils that contain abundant inositol phosphates. We conclude that soil properties exert a strong control on the amounts and forms of soil organic phosphorus in tropical rain forests, but that the proportion of the total phosphorus in organic forms is relatively insensitive to variation in climate and soil properties. Further work is now required to assess the contribution of soil organic phosphorus to the nutrition and diversity of plants in these species-rich ecosystems.
24715202|The response of soil respiration to warming has been poorly studied in regions at higher latitude with low precipitation. We manipulated air temperature, soil temperature and soil moisture using passive, open-top chambers (OTCs) in three different ecosystem settings in close proximity (boreal forest, riparian area, and semi-arid steppe) to investigate how environmental factors would affect soil respiration in these different ecosystems, anticipating that soil respiration would increase in response to the chamber treatment. The results indicated that OTCs significantly increased air and soil temperature in areas with open canopy and short-statured vegetation (i.e., steppe areas) but not in forest. OTCs also affected soil moisture, but the direction of change depended on the ecosystem, and the magnitude of change was highly variable. Generally, OTCs did not affect soil respiration in steppe and riparian areas. Although soil respiration was slightly greater in OTCs placed in the forest, the difference was not statistically significant. Analyses of relationships between soil respiration and environmental variables suggested that different factors controlled soil respiration in the different ecosystems. Competing effects analysis using a model selection approach and regression analyses (e.g., Q) demonstrated that soil respiration in the forest was more sensitive to warming, while soil respiration in the steppe was more sensitive to soil moisture. The differing responses and controlling factors among these neighboring forest, riparian and steppe ecosystems in Northern Mongolia highlight the importance of taking into account potential biome shifts in C cycling modeling to generate more accurate predictions of landscape-scale responses to anticipated climate change.
1469255| Experiments were conducted during 1993 at Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Front Range to determine if the insulating effect of winter snow cover allows soil microbial activity to significantly affect nitrogen inputs and outputs in alpine systems. Soil surface temperatures under seasonal snowpacks warmed from -14 C in January to 0 C by May 4th. Snowmelt began in mid-May and the sites were snow free by mid June. Heterotrophic microbial activity in snow-covered soils, measured as CO<sub>2</sub> production, was first identified on March 4, 1993. Net CO<sub>2</sub> flux increased from 55 mg CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> in early March to greater than 824 mg CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> by the middle of May. Carbon dioxide production decreased in late May as soils became saturated during snowmelt. Soil inorganic N concentrations increased before snowmelt, peaking between 101 and 276 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> soil in May, and then decreasing as soils became saturated with melt water. Net N mineralization for the period of March 3 to May 4 ranged from 2.23 to 6.63 g N m<sup>-2</sup>, and were approximately two orders of magnitude greater than snowmelt inputs of 50.4 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and 97.2 mg N m<sup>-2</sup> for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Both NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations remained at or below detection limits in surface water during snowmelt, indicating the only export of inorganic N from the system was through gaseous losses. Nitrous oxide production under snow was first observed in early April. Production increased as soils warmed, peaking at 75 g N<sub>2</sub>O-N m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> in soils saturated with melt water one week before the sites were snow free. These data suggest that microbial activity in snow-covered soils may play a key role in alpine N cycling before plants become active. 
1469569| Annual, volume-weighted concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in bulk precipitation have declined steadily (-0.44 mol/liter-yr) since 1965 at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH in response to decreases in regional SO<sub>2</sub> emissions (r<sup>2</sup>=0.74). Similar declines in concentrations have occurred in wet-only precipitation at HBEF and at nearby sites since 1978. However, decreases in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations following passage of the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990, were not unusual from the perspective of long-term data from the HBEF. Statistically significant declines (-5.6 mol/ha-yr) in bulk deposition of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> also have occurred since 1965 in relation to decreases in SO<sub>2</sub> emissions (r<sup>2</sup>=0.57), but annual variations in deposition also are strongly related to amount of precipitation and other factors. 
1468688|A two-year study of radium in the Suwannee River has shown that groundwater discharge, via springs, is a very important source of radium both to the river and to offshore Gulf of Mexico waters. Dissolved radium is maintained within relatively narrow limits in the river by uptake into suspended particles. In the estuary, dissolved radium versus salinity profiles show distinctive nonconservative behavior with radium in significant excess of its linear mixing value at mid-salinities. Unlike the situation in many other estuaries, however, desorption of radium from particles cannot account for most of the observed excess. Thus, the anomalously high radium characteristic of much of the west Florida shelf apparently does not have a riverine source. Direct effusion of high-radium groundwater into these coastal waters is thought to be the major supplier of radium, and perhaps other elements as well.
24715143|We measured the seasonal dynamics of major and trace elements concentrations in foliage of larch, main conifer species of Siberia, and we analyzed cryogenic soils collected in typical permafrost-dominated habitats in the Central Siberia. This region offers a unique opportunity to study element fractionation between the soil and the plant because of (i) the homogeneous geological substratum, (ii) the monospecific stands (Larix gmelinii) and (iii) the contrasted habitats (North-facing slope, South-facing slope, and Sphagnum peatbog) in terms of soil temperature, moisture, thickness of the active layer, tree biomass and rooting depth. The variation of these parameters from one habitat to the other allowed us to test the effects of these parameters on the element concentration in larch foliage considered with high seasonal resolution. Statistical treatment of data on larch needles collected 4 times in 3 locations during entire growing season (JuneSeptember) demonstrated that : (1) there is a high similarity of foliar chemical composition of larch trees in various habitats suggesting intrinsically similar requirements of larch tree growth for nutrients, (2) the variation of elemental concentrations in larch needles is controlled by the period (within the growing season) and not by the geographical location (South-facing slope, North-facing slope or bog zone) and (3) there are three groups of elements according to their patterns of elements concentration in needles over the growing season from June to September can be identified: (1): nutrient elements [P, Cu, Rb, K, B, Na, Zn, Ni and Cd] showing a decrease of concentration from June to September similar to the behaviour of major nutrients such as N, P and K; (2): accumulating elements [Ca, Mg, Mo, Co, Sr, Mn, Pb and Cr] showing an increase of concentration from JuneJuly to September; (3): indifferent elements [A1, Zr, Fe, Ba, Ti, REEs (Pr, Nd, Ce, La, Gd, Er, Dy, Tb, Lu, Yb, Tm, Sm, Ho, Eu), Y, Th and U] showing a decrease of concentration from June to July and then an increase of concentration to September. A number of micronutrients (e.g., Cu, Zn) demonstrate significant resorption at the end of growing season suggesting possible limitation by these elements. Although the intrinsic requirement seems to be similar among habitats, the total amount of element stored within the different habitats is drastically different due to the differences in standing tree biomass. The partitioning coefficients between soil and larch appear to be among the lowest compared to other environments with variable plants, soils and climates. Applying the "space for time" substitution scenario, it follows that under ongoing climate warming there will be an increase of the element stock following enhanced above-ground biomass accumulation, even considering zero modification of element ratios and their relative mobility. In this sense, the habitats like south-facing slopes can serve as resultant of climate warming effect on element cycling in larch ecosystems for the larger territory of Central Siberia.
24715349|The effects of drought on salt marsh sediments from Sapelo Island, Georgia, were examined in flow-through reactor experiments. Three hydrological treatments were employed: a continuously flooded anoxic control, a periodic drought treatment that experienced alternate periods of flooding and drying, and a severe drought treatment, where sediment was exposed to drought (drying) for several weeks and then flooded; the effect of both buffered and non-buffered flooding solutions were examined. In permanently anoxic sediments as well as in sediments exposed to drought, organic carbon oxidation was dominated by SO reduction (SR) and SR rates increased over time. The shift from anoxic to oxic conditions in drought treatments significantly altered sediment geochemistry and pathways of microbial metabolism. Drought conditions favored suboxic mineralization processes, such as Fe(III) reduction and denitrification, which was fueled by NH oxidation promoted by O delivered during drought conditions. Other major drought-induced changes included pH decrease, and altered concentrations of solid phase adsorbed metals.
1469841|Variation of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions over a three-year period was studied in a reed-dominated (Phragmites australis) littoral transect of a boreal lake undergoing shoreline displacement due to postglacial rebound. The seasonal variation in plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> emissions during open-water periods was significantly correlated with sediment temperature. The highest plant-mediated emission rates (up to 2050 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) were found in the outermost reed zone, where culms of the previous growing seasons had accumulated and free-floating plants grew on the decomposing culms. In reed zones closer to the shoreline as well as in mixed stands of reed and cattail, the maximum daily rates were usually > 500 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. The total plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> emission during the open-water period was significantly correlated with the seasonal maximum of green shoot biomass. This relationship was strongest in the continuously flooded (water depth > 25 cm) outermost zones. In this area, emissions through ebullition were of greatest importance and could exceed plant-mediated emissions. In general, total emissions of the open-water periods varied from ca. 20 to 50 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>, but in the outermost reed zone, the plant-mediated emissions could be as high as 123 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>; ebullition emissions from this zone reached > 100 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>. The proportion of CH<sub>4</sub> released in winter was usually < 10% of annual emissions. Emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> were higher in this flooded transgression shore the than those measured in boreal peatlands, but the role of ancient carbon stores as a substrate supply compared with recent anthropogenic eutrophication is unknown.
20519882|One of the key steps towards predicting dimethylsulfide (DMS) emission to the atmosphere is to understand the distribution and cycling of biogenic sulfur in the microlayer. In this study, we examined the distribution of DMS and dissolved and particulate fractions of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSPd and DMSPp) in the surface microlayer and bulk water of the western North Atlantic during July 2003. DMS concentrations in the bulk water varied from 0.71 to 7.65 nM. In contrast, DMS concentrations in the surface microlayer were fairly low (0.17-1.33 nM). Average concentrations of DMSPd and DMSPp in the bulk water were 2.09 (1.87-6.25) and 44.1 (8.06-119.8) nM, respectively, and those in the surface microlayer were 15.4 (4.06-54.3) and 29.9 (7.32-97.0) nM. In general, DMS was depleted in the microlayer (mean concentration: 0.60 nM) relative to the bulk water (mean concentration: 2.38 nM) with enrichment factors (the ratio of the microlayer concentration to bulk water concentration) ranging from 0.13 to 0.54. There was no consistent enrichment of DMSPp and chlorophyll a in the microlayer. On the contrary, DMSPd appeared to be highly enriched in the microlayer with an average EF of 4.89. The concentration of phaeopigments was also generally greater in the microlayer than in the bulk water, presumably due to enhanced photo-oxidation of chlorophyll a under high surface light intensities in the microlayer. In the study area, the concentration of DMSPp was significantly correlated with the abundance of dinoflagellates in the microlayer. Moreover, a significant correlation between the distributions of DMS, DMSPp, chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentrations in the microlayer and the bulk water demonstrated that the biogenic materials in the microlayer come primarily from the bulk water below.
1469738|Strong seasonal increases in aquatic (stream, ground and hyporheic water) nitrate have been observed in a variety of ecosystems. In most cases, changes in hydrological and vegetative activity occur contemporaneously, making it difficult to determine whether soil leaching is being driven by increases in the availability of leachable N or is simply due to flushing of N that has accumulated over longer periods. Three studies were conducted to better determine controls on soil nitrate leaching in a near-pristine temperate floodplain ecosystem receiving large N inputs via N-fixation by red alder: 1) an artificial rainfall experiment was conducted to estimate N-leaching potential during the summer, when plant uptake is high and new inputs of organic matter are low; 2) soil solution, groundwater and surface water were sampled during a major autumn storm to document exchanges at the seasonal transition, when plant uptake is low and inputs of senescent organic matter are high; and 3) monthly samples of soil and aquatic nitrogen were collected in 1997 and 1998 to document seasonal patterns of N exchanges. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the importance of hydrologic factors in controlling N flux. Nitrate was rapidly leached from soils during actual and simulated rainstorms. Two pathways of nitrate leaching were identified. Localized flooding and direct leaching of streamside soils into surface waters contributed to high solute concentrations in peak flows. Nitrate that leached into interstitial waters was subject to various factors that could delay or reduce its delivery to surface waters. Greater residence time may increase the influence of this component of stormflow on ecosystem productivity. While soil nitrate pools were rapidly depleted during rainstorms, accumulation of soil nitrate occurred over summer dry periods. Large differences in soil and aquatic nitrate concentrations between two years with contrasting rainfall highlight the potential for inter-annual hydrologic variability to affect ecosystem nutrient cycling.
1469692|We evaluated the accuracy of six watershed models of nitrogen export in streams (kg km<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) developed for use in large watersheds and representing various empirical and quasi-empirical approaches described in the literature. These models differ in their methods of calibration and have varying levels of spatial resolution and process complexity, which potentially affect the accuracy (bias and precision) of the model predictions of nitrogen export and source contributions to export. Using stream monitoring data and detailed estimates of the natural and cultural sources of nitrogen for 16 watersheds in the northeastern United States (drainage sizes = 475 to 70,000 km<sup>2</sup>), we assessed the accuracy of the model predictions of total nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen export. The model validation included the use of an error modeling technique to identify biases caused by model deficiencies in quantifying nitrogen sources and biogeochemical processes affecting the transport of nitrogen in watersheds. Most models predicted stream nitrogen export to within 50% of the measured export in a majority of the watersheds. Prediction errors were negatively correlated with cultivated land area, indicating that the watershed models tended to over predict export in less agricultural and more forested watersheds and under predict in more agricultural basins. The magnitude of these biases differed appreciably among the models. Those models having more detailed descriptions of nitrogen sources, land and water attenuation of nitrogen, and water flow paths were found to have considerably lower bias and higher precision in their predictions of nitrogen export.
40647946|Increased phosphorus availability may provoke serious eutrophication problems in wetlands. Strong evidence indicates that sulphate induced mobilization of phosphate (internal eutrophication) has been responsible for a strong decline of the biodiversity in wetlands during the last decades. It is currently underestimated, however, that the wide spread leaching of nitrate from agricultural lands can indirectly provoke strong internal phosphate eutrophication in wetlands, via its interference with sulphur and iron biogeochemistry in the subsoil. Nitrate can mobilize sulphate from geological pyrite deposits by the oxidation of FeS x in the aquifer, leading to a decrease of nitrate and an increase of groundwater sulphate concentrations. Furthermore nitrate immobilizes iron in the subsoil by oxidizing reduced (dissolved) iron. Increased sulphate concentrations may provoke strong phosphate eutrophication in wetlands fed directly or indirectly (via surface water) with groundwater as sulphate strongly interferes with iron phosphorus chemistry and stimulates anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Management of wetlands should therefore be approached at a broader scale which includes the landscape-scale management of groundwater systems. Leaching of nitrate to the groundwater, for instance, should not only receive attention for its potential effects on drinking water quality but above all because of the resulting large scale mobilization of sulphate from geological pyrite deposits and the immobilization of ferrous iron.
1469907| Methane concentrations have been measured along salinity profiles in nine tidal estuaries in Europe (Elbe, Ems, Thames, Rhine, Scheldt, Loire, Gironde, Douro and Sado). The Rhine, Scheldt and Gironde estuaries have been studied seasonally. A number of different methodologies have been used and they yielded consistent results. Surface water concentrations ranged from 0.002 to 3.6 M, corresponding to saturation ratios of 0.7 to 1580 with a median of 25. Methane concentrations in the fresh-water end-members varied from 0.01 to 1.4 M. Methane concentrations in the marine end-members were close to saturation offshore and on the order of 0.1 M in estuarine plumes. Methane versus salinity profiles in river-dominated, stratified estuaries (Rhine and Douro) appeared rather erratic whereas those in the well mixed, long-residence time estuaries (Elbe, Ems, Thames, Scheldt, Loire, Gironde and Sado) revealed consistent trends. In these systems dissolved methane initially decreases with increasing salinity, then increases to a maximum at intermediate to high salinities before decreasing again going offshore. Tidal flats and creeks were identified as a methane source to estuarine waters. The global estuarine flux of methane to the atmosphere has been calculated by combining the median water-air methane gradient (68.2 nmol dm<sup>-3</sup>) with a global area weighted transfer coefficient and the global area of estuaries. Estuaries emit 1.1 to 3.0 Tg CH<sub>4</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>, which is less than 9% of the global marine methane emission. 
1469466|Accelerated tree growth under elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may influence nutrient cycling in forests by (i) increasing the total leaf area, (ii) increasing the supply of soluble carbohydrate in leaf tissue, and (iii) increasing nutrient-use efficiency. Here we report the results of intensive sampling and laboratory analyses of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in throughfall precipitation during the first 2.5+ years of the Duke University Free-Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) experiment. After two growing seasons, a large increase (i.e., 48%) in throughfall deposition of DOC and significant trends in throughfall volume and in the deposition of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> can be attributed to the elevated CO<sub>2</sub> treatment. The substantial increase in deposition of DOC is most likely associated with increased availability of soluble C in plant foliage, whereas accelerated canopy growth may account for significant trends toward decreasing throughfall volume, decreasing deposition of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and H<sup>+</sup>, and increasing deposition of K<sup>+</sup> under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Despite considerable year-to-year variability, there were seasonal trends in net deposition of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, cations, and DOC associated with plant growth and leaf senescence. The altered chemical fluxes in throughfall suggest that soil solution chemistry may also be substantially altered with continued increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the future.
41490521|Current scientific consensus is that inshore regions of the central and southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, are at risk of impacts from increased nutrient (as well as sediment and pesticide) loads delivered to Reef waters. Increases in the discharge of water quality contaminants to the Reef are largely a consequence of the expansion of agricultural practices in northern Queensland catchments following European settlement in the 1850s. In particular, the presence of elevated chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations in many parts of the inshore Great Barrier Reef together with intense and extensive phytoplankton blooms following the discharge of nutrient-rich river flood waters suggest that the central and southern inshore area of the Great Barrier Reef is likely to be significantly impacted by elevated nutrient loads. The biological consequences of this are not fully quantified, but are likely to include changes in reef condition including hard and soft coral biodiversity, macroalgal abundance, hard coral cover and coral recruitment, as well as change in seagrass distribution and tissue nutrient status. Contemporary government policy is centered around promotion and funding of better catchment management practices to minimize the loss of catchment nutrients (both applied and natural) and the maintenance of a Reef wide water quality and ecosystem monitoring program. The monitoring program is designed to assess trends in uptake of management practice improvements and their associated impacts on water quality and ecosystem status over the next 10 years. A draft set of quantitative criteria to assess the eutrophication status of Great Barrier Reef waters is outlined for further discussion and refinement.
4151492|Nitrogen (N) cycling has been poorly characterized in urban ecosystems. Processes involving N are of specific concern due to increasing anthropogenic inputs from fertilizer uses and fossil fuel combustion in cities. Here we report on a study of N biogeochemistry in city green retention basins and city parks in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA. City retention basins receive N inputs from street runoff, and along with city parks, fertilizer input from management, making these urban patches potential hot spots for biogeochemical cycling. We sampled soils from six retention basins and two non-retention city parks and measured soil organic matter (SOM) content, net N mineralization, net nitrification, denitrification potential, and intact core denitrification flux and nitrate retention. Our results showed significantly higher SOM, extractable nitrate, nitrification rates and potential denitrification rates in surface soils (0- 7.5 cm; soil that is directly affected by fertilizer N input, irrigation, and storm runoff) than in deeper soils. We also observed a distinct horizontal trend of decreasing SOM and denitrification potentials from inlet to outlet (dry well) in the retention basins. Denitrification rates, measured both as potential rates with substrate amendment (
41490424|The photo- and bio-degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water from the Broad River were investigated in laboratory experiments using a solar simulator to control the intensity and exposure of samples to irradiation. The water samples included a natural assemblage of microorganisms, and the daily exposure of samples to irradiation was varied to distinguish the relative contributions of photochemical and biological degradation. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and specific components of DOM, including chromophoric DOM (CDOM), lignin phenols and amino acids, were monitored to investigate the reactivity and predominant pathway of degradation of these DOM components. Biodegradation was primarily responsible for the overall remineralization of DOC and losses of the amino acid component of DOM, whereas photodegradation was primarily responsible for losses of the chromophoric and lignin phenol components of DOM. The rates of photodegradation of lignin phenols were strongly influenced by the presence of methoxy groups on the aryl ring. Syringyl (S) phenols have two methoxy substitutions, vanillyl (V) phenols have one methoxy substitution, and p-hydroxy (P) phenols are not substituted with methoxy groups. Photochemical decay constants were highest for S phenols, lowest for  phenols and followed a consistent pattern (S > V > P) in the experiments. The carbon-normalized yields of amino acids and lignin phenols were found to be useful molecular indicators of the highly reactive (i.e. labile) components of biodegradable and photodegradable DOM, respectively.
20055319|This work addresses an intensively debated question in biogeochemical research: "Are large dams affecting global nutrient cycles?" It has been postulated that the largest impoundments on the Lower Danube River, the Iron Gates Reservoirs, act as a major sink for silica (Si) in the form of settling diatoms, for phosphorus (P) and to a lesser extent for nitrogen (N). This retention of P and N in the reservoir would represent a positive contribution to the nutrient reduction in the Danube River. Based on a 9-month monitoring scheme in 2001, we quantified the nutrient and the sediment retention capacity of the Iron Gate I Reservoir. The sediment accumulation corresponded to 5% TN (total nitrogen), 12% TP (total phosphorus) and 55% TSS (total suspended solids) of the incoming loading. A mass balance revealed that more N and P are leaving the reservoir than entering via the inflow. Based on these current results, the reservoir was temporarily acting as a small nutrient source. The nutrient accumulation in the sediments of the Iron Gate I Reservoir represents only 1% of the "missing" load of 10 t N and 1.3  10 t P defined as the difference between the estimated nutrient export from the Danube Basin and the measured flux entering the Black Sea. This result disproves the hypothesis that the largest impoundment on the Danube River, the Iron Gates Reservoir, plays a major role in N and P elimination.
1468680| The Mry-sur-Oise (France) storage reservoir is an artificial basin of 9 m average depth, fed by water from the river Oise with a mean residence time of about 4 days. Sediments are accumulating at a rate of about 0.7 cm/month. In the sediments, two fractions of organic nitrogen with different rates of bacterial degradation could be distinguished, one associated with fresh phytoplankton, the other made of detrital and more refractory compounds. The fluxes of oxygen, nitrate and ammonium across the sediment-water interface were measured with a bell-jar system at different seasons during a 3 year period following flooding of the basin. The measurements show clear seasonal variations in relation with the variations of temperature and input of fresh phytoplanktonic material to the sediment. In addition, a long term trend of increasing ammonium was observed. Measurements were also carried out after dredging of all accumulated sediments of the basin. They showed a considerable reduction of the flux of nitrate to the sediments and a significant reduction of the flux of ammonium to the water column. These results are interpreted in the light of a non stationary model of N diagenesis in accumulating sediments. This model is able to predict at least the general trends of benthic N cycling of basins during the early stage of their ecological succession. 
1469580| Patterns of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) delivery were compared between times of stormflow and baseflow in Paine Run, an Appalachian stream draining a 12.4 km<sup>2</sup> forested catchment in the Shenandoah National Park (SNP), Virginia. The potential in-stream ecological impact of altered concentrations and/or chemical composition of DOM during storms also was examined, using standardized bacterial bioassays. DOC and DON concentrations in Paine Run were consistently low during baseflow and did not show a seasonal pattern. During storms however, mean DOC and DON concentrations approximately doubled, with maximum concentrations occurring on the rising limb of storm hydrographs. The rapid response of DOM concentration to changes in flow suggests a near-stream or in-stream source of DOM during storms. Stormflow (4% of the time, 36% of the annual discharge) contributed >50% of DOC, DON and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> flux in Paine Run during 1997. In laboratory bacterial bioassays, growth rate constants were higher on Paine Run stormflow water than on baseflow water, but the fraction of total DOM which was bioavailable was not significantly different. The fraction of the total stream DOC pool taken up by water column bacteria was estimated to increase from 0.03  0.02% h<sup>-1</sup> during baseflow, to 0.15  0.04% h<sup>-1</sup> during storms. This uptake rate would have a minimal effect on bulk DOM concentrations in Paine Run, but storms may still have considerable impact on the bacterial stream communities by mobilizing them into the water column and by supplying a pulse of DOM. 
20456505|The carbon cycle was quantified in the catchment of Doe House Gill, which drains high-relief moorland, with thin organic-rich soils (leptosols and podzols) 10-25 cm deep, in northern England. The soil C pool of 8,300 g m is due mainly to humic acid and older humin. If steady state is assumed, and a single soil C pool, the average C content of the whole soil (93% modern) yields a mean carbon residence time of 800 years, although this varied from 300 to 1,600 years in the four samples studied. Stream water fluxes of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) were 2.5 and 0.4 g m a respectively in 2002-2003, lower than values for some other upland streams in the UK. The C pool, flux, and isotope data were used, with the assumption of steady state, to calibrate DyDOC, a model that simulates the soil carbon cycle, including the generation and transport of DOC. According to DyDOC, the litter pool (ca. 100 gC m) turns over quickly, and most (&gt;90%) of the litter carbon is rapidly mineralised. The soil is calculated to gain only 16 gC m a and to lose the same amount, about 80% as CO and 20% as DOC. From the DOC content of 107.5% modern (due to "bomb carbon") the model could be calibrated by assuming all DOC to come directly from litter, but DOC is more likely a mixture, derived from more than one soil C pool. The seasonal variability exhibited by stream water DOC concentration (maximum in September, minimum in January) is attributed mainly to variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration, rather than in the metabolic production rate of "potential DOC". The model predicts that, for a Q of 2, the total soil organic C pool would decrease by about 5% if subjected to warming over 200 years. DyDOC predicts higher DOC fluxes in response to increased litter inputs or warming, and can simulate changes in DOC flux due to variations in sorption to soil solids, that might occur due to acidification and its reversal.
1468979|Hydrochemical changes caused by slash-and-burn agricultural practices in a small upland catchment in the central Amazon were measured. Solute concentrations were analyzed in wet deposition, overland flow, shallow throughflow, groundwater and bank seepage in a forested plot (about 5 ha) and an adjacent plot (about 2 ha) which had been deforested in July 1989 and planted to manioc, and in stream water in partially deforested and forested catchments. Measurements were made from November 1988 to June 1990. The effects of slash-and-burn agricultural practices observed in the experimental plot included increased overland flow, erosion, and large losses of solutes from the rooted zone. Concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and Mn in throughflow of the experimental plot were higher than those of the control plot by more than a factor of 10. Extensive leaching occurred after cutting and burning, but solute transfers were diminished along pathway stages of throughflow to groundwater, and particularly within the riparian zone of the catchment. High concentrations of N and P in overland flow indicate the importance of using forested riparian buffers to mitigate solute inputs to receiving waters in tropical catchments.
20456475|In high-nutrient low-chlorophyll areas, bacterial degradation of organic matter may be iron-limited. The response of heterotrophic bacteria to Fe addition may be directly controlled by Fe availability and/or indirectly controlled through the effect of enhanced phytoplankton productivity and the subsequent supply of organic matter suitable for bacteria. In the present study, the role of Fe on bacterial carbon degradation was investigated through regrowth experiments by monitoring bacterial response to organic substrates derived from Phaeocystis antarctica cultures set up in &lt;1 nM Fe (LFe) and in Fe-amended (HFe) Antarctic seawater. Results showed an impact of Fe addition on the morphotype dominance (colonies vs. single cells) of P. antarctica and on the quality of Phaeocystis-derived organic matter. Fe addition leaded to a decrease of C/N ratio of Phaeocystis material. The bacterial community composition was modified as observed from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles in LFe as compared to HFe bioassays. The percentage of active bacteria as well as their specific metabolic activities (ectoenzymatic hydrolysis, growth rates and bacterial growth efficiency) were enhanced in HFe bioassays. As a consequence, the lability of Phaeocystis-derived organic matter was altered, i.e., after seven days more than 90% was degraded in HFe and only 9% (dissolved) and 55% (total) organic carbon were degraded in LFe bioassays. By inducing increased bacterial degradation and preventing the accumulation of dissolved organic carbon, the positive effect of Fe supply on the carbon biological pump may partly be counteracted.
20055289|We used five analytical approaches to compare net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO) from automated and manual static chambers in a peatland, and found the methods comparable. Once per week we sampled manually from 10 collars with a closed chamber system using a LiCor 6200 portable photosynthesis system, and simulated four photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) levels using shrouds. Ten automated chambers sampled CO flux every 3 h with a LiCor 6252 infrared gas analyzer. Results of the five comparisons showed (1) NEE measurements made from May to August, 2001 by the manual and automated chambers had similar ranges: -10.8 to 12.7 mol CO
1469609| Freshwater isoetids exchanges a high proportion of the photosynthetically produced oxygen over the extensive root system and, therefore, they influence the redox potential (E<sub>h</sub>) and phosphorus (P) availability in their sediments. Because isoetids rely on the sediment for P uptake, P may be a key element in controlling the distribution of isoetids. We investigated biomass and P availability to isoetids (Littorella uniflora and Isoetes lacustris) in a transect of five stations across the littoral zone in oligotrophic Lake Kalgaard, Denmark. At the two shallowest stations (0.6 and 1.0 m depth) the redox potential in the low organic rhizosphere sediment was high (>300 mV) and low concentrations of reduced exchangeable iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) compounds in the sediment and of precipitated Fe and Mn oxides on isoetid roots (plaques) were found. The concentration of sediment P pools was low and so was isoetid P content and isoetid biomass. At intermediate water depth (1.8 m) sediment E<sub>h</sub> was high (300 mV) and isoetids showed low root plaque concentrations. However, higher concentration of P pools in the rhizosphere was found at 1.8 m and isoetids showed the highest P content and biomass. At deeper stations (2.8 and 4.6 m depth) E<sub>h</sub> was low (<100 mV) in the high organic rhizosphere and high concentrations of plaques were found. The P content in the sediment was high, however, isoetids showed low biomass and low P content. We suggest that the low P content in isoetids growing on P rich organic sediments is partly due to inhibition of the P uptake because of adsorption of P to the oxidized Fe and Mn plaques. However, ratios between oxidized Fe and Fe-bound P, 150 for plaques and 40 for sediment, suggest the isoetids are able to access some of the P that is bound in the plaques. The pools of dissolved P in the porewater were 25-1100 times lower than the estimated annual P requirement for net growth of isoetids while solid fraction P pools were 20-260 times higher than the estimated annual P requirement. Clearly, the oxygen release from isoetid roots decreases the availability of P either by keeping the entire rhizosphere oxidized (low organic sediments) or by the formation of root plaques (high organic sediments). 
40647933|Human activities have greatly increased the transport of biologically available nitrogen (N) through watersheds to potentially sensitive coastal ecosystems. Lentie water bodies (lakes and reservoirs) have the potential to act as important sinks for this reactive N as it is transported across the landscape because they offer ideal conditions for N burial in sediments or permanent loss via denitrification. However, the patterns and controls on lentie N removal have not been explored in great detail at large regional to global scales. In this paper we describe, evaluate, and apply a new, spatially explicit, annual-scale, global model of lentie N removal called NiRReLa (Nitrogen Retention in Reservoirs and Lakes). The NiRReLa model incorporates small lakes and reservoirs than have been included in previous global analyses, and also allows for separate treatment and analysis of reservoirs and natural lakes. Model runs for the mid-1990s indicate that lentie systems are indeed important sinks for N and are conservatively estimated to remove 19.7 Tg N year from watersheds globally. Small lakes (<50 km) were critical in the analysis, retaining almost half (9.3 Tg N year) of the global total. In model runs, capacity of lakes and reservoirs to remove watershed N varied substantially at the half-degree scale (0-100%) both as a function of climate and the density of lentie systems. Although reservoirs occupy just 6% of the global lentie surface area, we estimate they retain ~33% of the total N removed by lentie systems, due to a combination of higher drainage ratios (catchment surface areailake or reservoir surface area), higher apparent settling velocities for N, and greater average N loading rates in reservoirs than in lakes. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of NiRReLa suggests that, on-average, N removal within lentie systems will respond more strongly to changes in land use and N loading than to changes in climate at the global scale.
20456496|Eutrophication caused by anthropogenic nutrient inputs is one of the greatest threats to the integrity of freshwater wetlands. The resultant changes in organic carbon cycling and nutrient mineralization may be expressed through increased decomposition rates, which are ultimately dependent on the metabolism of the resident microbial community. Specifically, microbial nutrient acquisition is controlled through the activity of enzymes, which are in turn influenced by local biogeochemical conditions. This study examines enzyme activities along distinct North-South P gradients within four distinct hydrologic units of the Florida Everglades. The results indicate that nutrient enriched sites exhibit lower N and P limitations on microbially constrained C mineralization, in addition to enhanced cellulose decomposition rates. Nutrient loading resulted in decreased microbial mobilization of resources for P mineralization, resulting in greater energetic allocation for C mineralization. Additionally, N appears to become less limiting to C mineralization in the enriched sites within Everglades National Park, the least P enriched area within the Everglades. A simple two component model, incorporating total P and the relationship between the enzymes involved in C and P mineralization accounted for between 46 and 92% of the variability in measured cellulose decomposition rates and thus demonstrates the significant influence that P loading plays in these systems. These results also suggest there is an environmental threshold TP concentration below which changes in enzyme-based resource allocation will not occur.
40343570|Understanding how the concentration and chemical quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies in soils is critical because DOM influences an array of biological, chemical, and physical processes. We used PARAFAC modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy, specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate the chemical quality of DOM in soil water collected from 25 cm piezometers in four different wetland and forest soils: bog, forested wetland, fen and upland forest. There were significant differences in soil solution concentrations of dissolved organic C, N, and P, DOC: DON ratios, SUVA and BDOC among the four soil types. Throughout the sampling period, average DOC concentrations in the four soil types ranged from 9-32 mg C1 and between 23-42% of the DOC was biodegradable. Seasonal patterns in dissolved nutrient concentrations and BDOC were observed in the three wetland types suggesting strong biotic controls over DOM concentrations in wetland soils. PARAFAC modeling of excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy showed that protein-like fluorescence was positively correlated (r = 0.82; p<0.001) with BDOC for all soil types taken together. This finding indicates that PARAFAC modeling may substantially improve the ability to predict BDOC in natural environments. Coincident measurements of DOM concentrations, BDOC and PARAFAC modeling confirmed that the four soil types contain DOM with distinct chemical properties and have unique fluorescent fingerprints. DOM inputs to streams from the four soil types therefore have the potential to alter stream biogeochemical processes differently by influencing temporal patterns in stream heterotrophic productivity.
1469375|In this manuscript we investigated the relationships between the microbiological denitrification process in river alluvial soils with structures and patterns of the floodplain visible at a larger scale. We hypothesised that both topography and soil grain size represent pertinent environmental factors to forecast denitrification activity in river floodplain. The study was conducted in 15 alluvial sites along a 30 km long stretch of the Garonne River, a seventh-order stream of the south west of France. Sites were selected to encompass the widest range possible of average annual flood duration (0.04 to 29 days) and frequency (return period from 0.6 to 7 years). On an annual basis, we found that average denitrification rates did not show any significant trend along the flood frequency gradient. Although during the study the flood frequency and duration was higher than the calculated average, we did not find any relationship between flood duration and denitrification enzyme activity. If flood events do not last long enough to maintain waterlogging conditions conducive to sustain denitrification activity for long periods, they indirectly affect the spatial distribution of denitrification activity through the sorting out of sediment deposits. Indeed, we found a significant relationship between denitrification rates in the floodplain soils and their texture; highest rates were measured in fine textured soils with high silt + clay content. Below a threshold of 65% of silt and clay content, the floodplain soils did not present any significant denitrification rates. Above that threshold denitrification increased linearly. These results demonstrate that alluvial soil texture is a landscape scale factor which has a significant effect on denitrification in floodplains.
24715107|Soil extracellular enzymes mediate organic matter turnover and nutrient cycling yet remain little studied in one of Earth's most rapidly changing, productive biomes: tropical forests. Using a long-term leaf litter and throughfall manipulation, we explored relationships between organic matter (OM) inputs, soil chemical properties and enzyme activities in a lowland tropical forest. We assayed six hydrolytic soil enzymes responsible for liberating carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), calculated enzyme activities and ratios in control plots versus treatments, and related these to soil biogeochemical variables. While leaf litter addition and removal tended to increase and decrease enzyme activities per gram soil, respectively, shifts in enzyme allocation patterns implied changes in relative nutrient constraints with altered OM inputs. Enzyme activity ratios in control plots suggested strong belowground P constraints; this was exacerbated when litter inputs were curtailed. Conversely, with double litter inputs, increased enzymatic investment in N acquisition indicated elevated N demand. Across all treatments, total soil C correlated more strongly with enzyme activities than soluble C fluxes, and enzyme ratios were sensitive to resource stoichiometry (soil C:N) and N availability (net N mineralization). Despite high annual precipitation in this site (MAP 5 m), soil moisture positively correlated with five of six enzymes. Our results suggest resource availability regulates tropical soil enzyme activities, soil moisture plays an additional role even in very wet forests, and relative investment in C, N and P degrading enzymes in tropical soils will often be distinct from higher latitude ecosystems yet is sensitive to OM inputs.
20519774|Atmospheric bulk depositions of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), soluble unreactive phosphorus (SUP), particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP), particulate organic phosphorus (POP), total phosphorus (TP) and some other dissolved and particulate components were monitored for 3 years in Ashiu, Central Japan. The mean bulk depositions of SRP, SUP, PIP, POP, TP, dissolved components (Na, Mg, nss-Ca, K, V, Mo, nss-SO) and particulate components (Al, Fe, Ti, Ca, Mg, Mn, Ba, Sr, Zn) were 175, 76, 136, 397, 783, 156,000, 10,900, 7450, 5470, 10.3, 1.52, 40,100, 13,200, 3590, 2630, 576, 624, 42.3, 30.2, 17.4, 8.2 mol m year, respectively. The value for TP deposition was in the lower range of previous literature. The low P deposition probably reflected the method applied to reduce the contribution of local particles, including (1) placement of samplers off the ground surface, (2) installation of multiple samplers, and (3) rejection of contaminated samples. Al data suggested that 15  5% of TP was brought by lithogenic dust from East Eurasia. Nss-SO and Mo data and air-mass backward trajectories suggested that 39  4% of TP was derived from coal combustion in China. It was speculated that the rest (47  6%) of the TP deposition might be predominantly attributed to the contribution of local biogenic particles. Net atmospheric TP input (lithogenic dust and fossil fuel combustion) was almost equal to the TP outflow from Japanese forests on granitic soils.
1468745|The mass balance and internal cycle of sulfur within a small forested, Sphagnum bog in northern Minnesota are presented here based on a 4-year record of hydrologic inputs and outputs (precipitation, throughfall, streamflow, upland runoff) and a 3-year measurement of plant growth and sulfur uptake. Concentrations and accumulation rates of inorganic and organic sulfur species were measured in porewater. The bog is a large sink for sulfur, retaining 37% of the total sulfur input. Because of the relatively large export of organic S (21% of inputs), retention efficiency for total-S (organic S+SO<sub>4</sub><sup>=</sup>; 37%) is less than that for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>=</sup> (58%). There is a dynamic cycle of oxidation and reduction within the bog. Annual oxidation and recycling of S is equal to total inputs in the center of the bog. Plants receive 47% of their uptake requirement from atmospheric deposition, 5% from retranslocation from foliage, and the remainder from sulfur remineralized from peat. Mineralization is most intense in the aerobic zone above the water table. Inorganic sulfur species comprise <5% of the total sulfur burden within the peat.
1469799|Between 1992 and 2000, we sampled 504 randomly chosen locations in the Florida Keys, Florida, USA, for the elemental content of green leaves of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum. Carbon content ranged from 29.4-43.3% (dry weight), nitrogen content from 0.88-3.96%, and phosphorus content from 0.048-0.243%. N and P content of the samples were not correlated, suggesting that the relative availability of N and P varied across the sampling region. Spatial pattern in C:N indicated a decrease in N availability from inshore waters to the reef tract 10 km offshore; in contrast, the pattern in C:P indicated an increase in P availability from inshore waters to the reef tract. The spatial pattern in N:P was used to define a P-limited region of seagrass beds in Florida Bay and near shore, and an N-limited region of seagrass beds offshore. The close juxtaposition of N-and P-limited regions allows the possibility that N loading from the suburban Florida Keys could influence the offshore, N-limited seagrass beds without impacting the more nearshore, P-limited seagrass beds.
20456443|Few studies of silicate mineral weathering have been conducted in carbonate-bearing temperate forest soils. With climate and vegetation held constant, we compared soil mineralogy and major element chemistry of soil waters from a carbonate-free temperate aspen forest site in the Cheboygan watershed, northern Michigan, with that from carbonate-containing soils from experimental tree-growth chambers (low- vs. high- fertility). All soils were well-drained sands (quartz, Na-rich plagioclase, and K-feldspar) with minor amounts of carbonate present only in the experimentally manipulated soils. The Na concentrations in soil waters corrected for atmospheric deposition (
23359718|In the Sargasso Sea, maximum dimethylsulfide (DMS) accumulation occurs in summer, concomitant with the minimum of chlorophyll and 2 months later than its precursor, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). This phenomenon is often referred to as the DMS "summer paradox". It has been previously suggested that the main agent triggering this pattern is increasing irradiance leading to light stress-induced DMS release from phytoplankton cells. We have developed a new model describing DMS(P) dynamics in the water column and used it to investigate how and to what extent processes other than light induced DMS exudation from phytoplankton, may contribute to the DMS summer paradox. To do this, we have conceptually divided the DMS "summer paradox" into two components: (1) the temporal decoupling between chlorophyll and DMSP and (2) the temporal decoupling between DMSP and DMS. Our results suggest that it is possible to explain the above cited patterns by means of two different dynamics, respectively: (1) a succession of phytoplankton types in the surface water and (2) the bacterially mediated DMSP(d) to DMS conversion, seasonally varying as a function of nutrient limitation. This work differs from previous modelling studies in that the presented model suggests that phytoplankton light-stress induced processes may only partially explain the summer paradox, not being able to explain the decoupling between DMSP and DMS, which is possibly the more challenging aspect of this phenomenon. Our study, therefore, provides an "alternative" explanation to the summer paradox further underlining the major role that bacteria potentially play in DMS production and fate.
1468651|Soils from rookeries of penguin, of gull, and of albatross were examined for their nitrogen isotope ratio. The ratio was far higher than any so far reported for soils. Furthermore, there was an apparent dependence of the ratio on the latitude of rookery locations. The high ratio seemed to have had resulted from a relatively high ratio for incoming nitrogen to the rookeries, and from the large fractionation factor during the ammonia volatilization from the rookeries. The isotope ratio for ammonium nitrogen of the penguin rookery soils averaged 45 per mil, while that of the gull rookery soils gave the mean of 27 per mil during the breeding season of the birds. Soils of gull rookeries and of albatross rookery gave, on the average, a similar ratio of 17 per mil for Kjeldahl nitrogen, though its content of soils of gull rookeries was nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of albatross rookery. Soils from penguin rookery showed the ratio of 32 per mil for Kjeldahl nitrogen, the enrichment of <sup>15</sup>N being two and a half times as large as that for soils of other rookeries.
1468726|The effect of topography on the nature of humic substances, isolated as water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), fulvic acid (FA), and humic acid (HA) was evaluated by comparing relative proportion and chemical characteristics of these fractions in upland and bottomland Coastal Plain soils in South Carolina. The fractions were characterized by elemental analysis and <sup>13</sup>C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy. The majority of humic substances occur as humic acids, with bottomland soils having higher HA/FA ratios when compared to upland soils. We found no significant differences between upland and bottomland humic substances with respect to yields of WSOC and fulvic acids, and in the C and N content of humic and fulvic acids. Carbon-13 CPMAS NMR spectroscopy revealed that the WSOC and fulvic acid fractions were composed largely of O-alkyl-C structures with bottomland soils having higher amounts of these groups. Humic acid C distribution was similar between upland and bottomland soils and was largely composed of aromatic groups. Our results demonstrate that topography influences the formation of humic acid and the structural and chemical properties of the various humic fractions.
1469532| A synthesis of the biogeochemistry of Ca was done during 1963-1992 in reference and human-manipulated forest ecosystems of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH. Results showed that there has been a marked decline in concentration and input of Ca in bulk precipitation, an overall decline in concentration and output of Ca in stream water, and marked depletion of Ca in soils of the HBEF since 1963. The decline in streamwater Ca was related strongly to a decline in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>+NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in stream water during the period. The soil depletion of Ca was the result of leaching due to inputs of acid rain during the past 50 yr or so, to decreasing atmospheric inputs of Ca, and to changing amounts of net storage of Ca in biomass. As a result of the depletion of Ca, forest ecosystems at HBEF are much more sensitive to continuing inputs of strong acids in atmospheric deposition than expected based on long-term patterns of sulfur biogeochemistry. The Ca concentration and input in bulk precipitation ranged from a low of 1.0 mol/l and 15 mol/ha-yr in 1986-87 to a high of 8.0 mol/l and 77 mol/ha-yr in 1964-65, with a long-term mean of 2.74 mol/l during 1963-92. Average total atmospheric deposition was 61 and 29 mol/ha-yr in 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. Dry deposition is difficult to measure, but was estimated to be about 20% of total input in atmospheric deposition. Streamwater concentration reached a low of 21 mol/l in 1991-92 and a high of 41 mol/l in 1969-70, but outputs of Ca were lowest in 1964-65 (121 mol/ha-yr) and peaked in 1973-74 (475 mol/ha-yr). Gross outputs of Ca in stream water were positively and significantly related to streamflow, but the slope of this relation changed with time as Ca was depleted from the soil, and as the inputs of sulfate declined in both atmospheric deposition and stream water. Gross outputs of Ca in stream water consistently exceeded inputs in bulk precipitation. No seasonal pattern was observed for either bulk precipitation or streamwater concentrations of Ca. Net soil release varied from 390 to 230 mol/ha-yr during 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. Of this amount, weathering release of Ca, based on plagioclase composition of the soil, was estimated at about 50 mol/ha-yr. Net biomass storage of Ca decreased from 202 to 54 mol/ha-yr, and throughfall plus stemflow decreased from 220 to 110 mol/ha-yr in 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. These ecosystem response patterns were related to acidification and to decreases in net biomass accretion during the study. Calcium return to soil by fine root turnover was about 270 mol/ha-yr, with 190 mol/ha-yr returning to the forest floor and 80 mol/ha-yr to the mineral soil. A lower content of Ca was observed with increasing elevation for most of the components of the watershed-ecosystems at HBEF. Possibly as a result, mortality of sugar maple increased significantly during 1982 to 1992 at high elevations of the HBEF. Interactions between biotic and abiotic control mechanisms were evident through elevational differences in soil cation exchange capacity (the exchangeable Ca concentration in soils was significantly and directly related to the organic matter content of the soils), in soil/till depth, and in soil water and in streamwater concentrations at the HBEF, all of which tended to decrease with elevation. The exchangeable pool of Ca in the soil is about 6500 mol/ha, and its turnover time is quite rapid, about 3 yr. Nevertheless, the exchangeable pools of Ca at HBEF have been depleted markedly during the past 50 years or so, >21, 125 mol/ha during 1940-1995. The annual gross uptake of trees is about 26-30% of the exchangeable pool in the soil. Some 7 to 8 times more Ca is cycled through trees than is lost in stream water each year, and resorption of Ca by trees is negligible at HBEF. Of the current inputs to the available nutrient compartment of the forest ecosystem, some 50% was provided by net soil release, 24% by leaching from the canopy, 20% by root exudates and 6% by atmospheric deposition. Clear cutting released large amounts of Ca to stream water, primarily because increased nitrification in the soil generated increased acidity and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, a mobile anion in drainage water; even larger amounts of Ca can be lost from the ecosystem in harvested timber products. The magnitude of Ca loss due to whole-tree harvest and acid rain leaching is comparable for forests similar to the HBEF, but losses from harvest must be superimposed on losses due to acid rain. 
1469926|Climate change will likely result in warmer winter temperatures leading to less snowfall in temperate forests. These changes may lead to increases in soil freezing because of lack of an insulating snow cover and changes in soil water dynamics during the important snowmelt period. In this study, we manipulated snow depth by removing snow for two winters, simulating the late development of the snowpack as may occur with global warming, to explore the relationships between snow depth, soil freezing, soil moisture, and infiltration. We established four sites, each with two paired plots, at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, U.S.A. and instrumented all eight plots with soil and snow thermistors, frost tubes, soil moisture probes, and soil lysimeters. For two winters, we removed snow from the designated treatment plots until February. Snow in the reference plots was undisturbed. The treatment winters (1997/1998 and 1998/1999) were relatively mild, with temperatures above the seasonal norm and snow depths below average. Results show the treated plots accumulated significantly less snow and had more extensive soil frost than reference plots. Snow depth was a strong regulator of soil temperature and frost depth at all sites. Soil moisture measured by time domain reflectometry probes and leaching volumes collected in lysimeters were lower in the treatment plots in March and April compared to the rest of the year. The ratio of leachate volumes collected in the treatment plots to that in the reference plots decreased as the snow ablation seasons progressed. Our data show that even mild winters with low snowfall, simulated by snow removal, will result in increased soil freezing in the forests at the HBEF. Our results suggest that a climate shift toward less snowfall or a shorter duration of snow on the ground will produce increases in soil freezing in northern hardwood forests. Increases in soil freezing will have implications for changes in soil biogeochemical processes.
1468991| Rates of in situ sulfate reduction (SRR) in planted and unplanted rice field soil were measured by the <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>-radiotracer method using soil microcosms. The concentration of <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> decreased exponentially with time. However, time course experiments indicated that incubation times of 10-30 min were appropriate for measurements of SRR using a single time point in routine assays. Unplanted microcosms showed high SRR of 177 nmol cm<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in the uppermost centimeter where average sulfate concentrations were <33 M. Fine scaled measurements (1 mm resolution) localized highest SRR (<100 nmol cm<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) at the oxic/anoxic interface at 2-5 mm depth. In planted rice field soil, SRR of <310 nmol cm<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> were observed at 0-2 cm depth. Sulfate reduction rates were determined at a millimeter-scale with distance to a two dimensional root compartment. The SRR was highest at 0-1.5 mm distance to the root layer with rates up to 500 nmol cm<sup>-3</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, indicating a high stimulation potential of the rice roots. SRR seemed to be mainly dependent on the in situ sulfate porewater concentrations. At the soil surface of unplanted microcosms sulfate concentration decreased from <150 M to <10 M within the first 8 mm of depth. In planted microcosms sulfate concentration varied from 87-99 M sulfate at the 0-3 mm distance to the root layer to 48-62 M sulfate at a root distance >4 mm from the roots. The depth distribution of inorganic sulfur compounds was determined for planted and unplanted rice field soil. Sulfate, acid volatile sulfide (AVS) and chromium reducible sulfide (CRS) were up to 20 fold higher in planted than in unplanted microcosms. CRS was the major insoluble sulfur fraction with concentrations >1.7 mol cm<sup>-3</sup>. Organic sulfur accounted for 25-46% of the total sulfur present (269 g/g dw) in an unplanted microcosm. The biogeo-chemical role of sulfate reduction for short-term accumulation of inorganic sulfur compounds (FeS, FeS<sub>2</sub> and S) in rice soil was determined in a time course experiment with incubation periods of 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 min. The relative distribution of CRS and AVS formation showed little depth dependence, whereas the formation of <sup>35</sup>S<sup>o</sup> seemed to be the highest in the more oxidized upper soil layers and near the root surface. AV<sup>35</sup>S was the first major product of sulfate reduction after 20-30 min, whereas CR<sup>35</sup>S was formed, as AV<sup>35</sup>S and <sup>35</sup>S<sup>o</sup> decreased, at longer incubation periods of >30 min. 
24715197|There is a strong trend toward reforestation of abandoned grasslands in alpine regions which may impact the carbon balance of alpine ecosystems. Here, we studied the effects of afforestation with Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) on an extensively grazed subalpine pasture in Switzerland on soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling and storage. Along a 120-year long chronosequence with spruce stands of 25, 30, 40, 45, and >120 years and adjacent pastures, we measured tree biomass, SOC stocks down to the bedrock, natural C abundances, and litter quality. To unravel controls on SOC cycling, we have monitored microclimatic conditions and quantified SOC decomposability under standardized conditions as well as soil respiration in situ. Stocks of SOC were only moderately affected by the afforestation: in the mineral soil, SOC stocks transiently decreased after tree establishment, reaching a minimum 40-45 years after afforestation (25 %) and increased thereafter. Soils of the mature spruce forest stored the largest amount of SOC, 13 % more than the pasture soils, mainly due to the accumulation of an organic layer (23 t C ha). By comparison, C accumulated in the tree biomass exceeded the SOC pool by a factor of three in the old forest. In contrast to the small impact on C storage, afforestation strongly influenced the composition and quality of the soil organic matter (SOM). With increasing stand age, C values of the SOM became consistently more positive, which can be interpreted as a gradual replacement of grass- by spruce-derived C. Fine roots of spruce were enriched in C, in lignin and had a higher C/N ratio in comparison to grass roots. As a consequence, SOM quality as indicated by the lower fraction of readily decomposable (labile) SOM and higher C:N ratios declined after the land-use change. Furthermore, spruce plantation induced a less favorable microclimate for microbial activity with the average soil temperature during the growing season being 5 C lower in the spruce stands than in the pasture. In situ soil respiration was approximately 50 % lower after the land use conversion, which we primarily attribute to the colder conditions and the lower SOM quality, but also to drier soils (25 %) and to a decreased fine root biomass (40 %). In summary, afforestation on subalpine pastures only moderately affected SOC storage as compared to the large C sink in tree biomass. In contrast, SOC cycling rates strongly decreased as a result of a less favorable microclimate for decomposition of SOM, a lower C input by roots, and a lower litter quality.
1469695|Growing populations in northeast Asia have greatly altered the nitrogen cycle, with increases in agricultural production to feed the population, and with increases in N emissions and transboundary air pollution. For example, during the 1900's over 50% of the N deposition over Republic of Korea was imported from abroad. In this paper, we present biogeochemical budgets of N for the South Korean peninsula (the Republic of Korea) and for the Yellow Sea region. We quantify N inputs from atmospheric deposition, fertilizers, biological fixation, and imports of food, feed, and products. We quantify outputs in riverine export, crop uptake, denitrification, volatilization, runoff, sedimentation and sea water exchange. Calculations were conducted using mean values from 1994-1997. All of the nitrogen budgets were positive, with N inputs exceeding outputs. The excess N inputs gave rise to increases in N storage in landfills and in groundwater. Annual accumulation of N in the Yellow sea, including inputs from South Korea and other drainage areas, was 1229 kt yr<sup>-1</sup> with a residence time for N of approximately 1.5 years, thus doubling N content in marine waters every 3 years during 1994-1997. The human derived N inputs leads to excessive eutrophication and pollution of the Yellow Sea.
4151483|Complexation between Hg(II) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected from streams in Ontario, Canada, was studied using three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (3DEEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that DOM reacted with Hg(II) rapidly, and the complexation reached pseudo-equilibrium within 20 s. Maximum excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelengths shifted towards the longer wavelengths, indicating that DOM structure changed during its interaction with Hg(II). Using fluorescence quenching titrations, complexing parameters, conditional stability constants and the percentage of fluorophores participating in the complexation, were estimated by the modified Stern-Volmer equation. The experimental and field survey results suggest that the Hg-DOM complexation in various streams was related to water quality parameters, e.g. DOC, Cl
40647956|Inspired by previous studies that have indicated consistent or even well-constrained (relatively low variability) relations among carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in soils, we have endeavored to explore general soil C:N:P ratios in China on a national scale, as well as the changing patterns of these ratios with soil depth, developmental stages and climate; we also attempted to determine if well-constrained C: N:P stoichiometrical ratios exist in China's soil. Based on an inventory data set of 2,384 soil profiles, our analysis indicated that the mean C:N, C:P and N:P ratios for the entire soil depth (as deep as 250 cm for some soil profiles) in China were 11.9, 61 and 5.2, respectively, showing a C: N: P ratio of ~ 60: 5:1. C:N ratios showed relatively small variation among different climatic zones, soil orders, soil depth and weathering stages, while C:P and N:P ratios showed a high spatial heterogeneity and large variations in different climatic zones, soil orders, soil depth and weathering stages. No well-constrained C:N:P ratios were found for the entire soil depth in China. However, for the 0-10 cm organic-rich soil, which has the most active organism-environment interaction, we found a well-constrained C:N ratio (14.4, molar ratio) and relatively consistent C:P (136) and N: P (9.3) ratios, with a general C:N:P ratio of 134:9:1. Finally, we suggested that soil C:N, C:P and N:P ratios in organic-rich topsoil could be a good indicator of soil nutrient status during soil development.
1469464|Cumulative effects of atmospheric N deposition may increase N export from watersheds and contribute to the acidification of surface waters, but natural factors (such as forest productivity and soil drainage) that affect forest N cycling can also control watershed N export. To identify factors that are related to stream-water export of N, elevational gradients in atmospheric deposition and natural processes were evaluated in a steep, first-order watershed in the Catskill Mountains of New York, from 1991 to 1994. Atmospheric deposition of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and probably N, increased with increasing elevation within this watershed. Stream-water concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> increased with increasing elevation throughout the year, whereas stream-water concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> decreased with increasing elevation during the winter and spring snowmelt period, and showed no relation with elevation during the growing season or the fall. Annual export of N in stream water for the overall watershed equaled 12% to 17% of the total atmospheric input on the basis of two methods of estimation. This percentage decreased with increasing elevation, from about 25% in the lowest subwatershed to 7% in the highest subwatershed; a probable result of an upslope increase in the thickness of the surface organic horizon, attributable to an elevational gradient in temperature that slows decomposition rates at upper elevations. Balsam fir stands, more prevalent at upper elevations than lower elevations, may also affect the gradient of subwatershed N export by altering nitrification rates in the soil. Variations in climate and vegetation must be considered to determine how future trends in atmospheric deposition will effect watershed export of nitrogen.
1469871|Rates of total methane production, acetate fermentation and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction were compared for two different wetland sites. On a per-liter basis, sediments from the White Oak River estuary, a tidal freshwater site in eastern North Carolina, had an annual methane production rate (53.3 mM yr<sup>-1</sup>) an order of magnitude higher than that of Buck Hollow Bog (5.5 mM yr<sup>-1</sup>), a peatland in Michigan. Methane was produced in the White Oak River site on an annual basis by both acetate fermentation (72%) and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction (28%) in a ratio typical of freshwater methanogenic sites. Competition for acetate by non-methanogenic microorganisms in Buck Hollow peat limited methane production from acetate to only a few months a year, severely impacting annual methane production rates. However, when acetate was available to the methanogens in the peat during early spring, the percentage of methane production from acetate fermentation (84%) and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction (16%) and rates of total methane production were similar to those of the White Oak River sediments at the same temperature. Rates of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction and acetate fermentation conducted at both sites at various temperatures showed that Buck Hollow peat methane production was also limited by a colder temperature regime as well as differences in the response of the CO<sub>2</sub> reducing and aceticlastic methanogens to temperature variations.
23359751|Microcosms with Pinus sylvestris seedlings in symbiosis with the fungus mycorrhizal Paxillus involutus were established, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterise plant photosynthate-driven fungal interactions with mineral surfaces. Comparison of images of the same area of the minerals before and after mycorrhizal fungal colonization showed extensive growth of hyphae on three different mineral surfaces  hornblende, biotite and chlorite. A layer of biological exudate, or biolayer, covered the entire mineral surface and was composed of globular features of diameter 1080 nm, and the morphology of the biolayer differed among mineral types. Similar-sized components were found on the fungal hyphae, but with a more elongated profile. Biolayer and hyphae surfaces both appeared to be hydrophobic with the hyphal surfaces yielding higher maximal adhesive interactions and a wider range of values: the mean ( SE) adhesive forces were 2.63  0.03 and 3.46  0.18 nN for biolayer and hypha, respectively. The highest adhesion forces are preferentially localized at the hyphal surface above the Spitzenkrper region and close to the tip, with a mean interaction force in this locality of 5.24  0.49 nN. Biolayer thickness was between 10 and 40 nm. The underlying mineral was easily broken up by the tip, in contrast to the native mineral. These observations of mineral surfaces colonised by mycorrhizal fungus demonstrate how fungal hyphae are able to form a layer of organic exudates, or biolayer, and its role in hyphal attachment and potential weathering of ferromagnesian silicates, which may supply nutrients to the plant.
1469094| Denitrification (N<sub>2</sub> production) and oxygen consumption rates were measured at ambient field nitrate concentrations during summer in sediments from eight wetlands (mixed hardwood swamps, cedar swamps, heath dominated shrub wetland, herbaceous peatland, and a wetland lacking live vegetation) and two streams. The study sites included wetlands in undisturbed watersheds and in watersheds with considerable agricultural and/or sewage treatment effluent input. Denitrification rates measured in intact cores of water-saturated sediment ranged from  20 to 260  mol N m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> among the three undisturbed wetlands and were less variable (180 to 260  mol N m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) among the four disturbed wetlands. Denitrification rates increased when nitrate concentrations in the overlying water were increased experimentally (1 up to 770 M), indicating that nitrate was an important factor controlling denitrification rates. However, rates of nitrate uptake from the overlying water were not a good predictor of denitrification rates because nitrification in the sediments also supplied nitrate for denitrification. Regardless of the dominant vegetation, pH, or degree of disturbance, denitrification rates were best correlated with sediment oxygen consumption rates (r<sup>2</sup>=0.912) indicating a relationship between denitrification and organic matter mineralization and/or sediment nitrification rates. Rates of denitrification in the wetland sediments were similar to those in adjacent stream sediments. Rates of denitrification in these wetlands were within the range of rates previously reported for water-saturated wetland sediments and flooded soils using whole core <sup>15</sup>N techniques that quantify coupled nitrification/denitrification, and were higher than rates reported from aerobic (non-saturated) wetland sediments using acetylene block methods. 
24715122|The potential effect of sustained hypoxia (up to 70 days) on the production of N gas through denitrification and anammox, as well as sedimentwater exchange of nitrite, nitrate and ammonia, oxygen consumption and penetration, were measured in mesocosms using sediment collected from the southern North Sea (north of Dogger Bank). As expected, both the penetration of oxygen into, and consumption of oxygen by, the sediment decreased by 42 and 46 %, respectively, once hypoxia was established. Importantly, the oxygen regime did not change significantly (P > 0.05) during the experiment, suggesting that organic carbon was not depleted. During the first 10 days, the exchange of NO, NO and NH between the sediment and water was erratic but once a steady state was established the sediment acted as either a sink for fixed nitrogen under hypoxia or as a source in the controls. Over the course of the mesocosm experiment the rate of both anammox and denitrification increased, with anammox increasing disproportionately under hypoxia relative to the controls, whereas the rate of increase in denitrification was the same for both. Under sustained hypoxia the production of N gas increased by 72 % relative to the controls, with this increase in N production remaining constant regardless of the duration of hypoxia. Longer periods of stratification and oxygen depletion are predicted to occur more regularly in the bottom waters of shallow coastal seas as one manifestation of climate change. Under sustained hypoxia the potential for nitrogen removal by the production of N gas in this region of the southern North Sea was estimated to increase from 2.1 kt N 150 days to 3.6 kt 150 days, while the efflux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ceased altogether; both of which could down regulate the productivity of this region as a whole.
1469008| Wetlands of northern Belize provide a unique opportunity to study methane production and emissions from marshes dominated by identical species (Typha domingensis, Cladium jamaicense) and genus (Eleocharis spp.), but differing substantially in the amount of sulfates present in the sediments. Some marshes occur on limestone marls rich in gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>) while others are underlain by alluvial sands poor in sulfates. Concentrations of methane and sulfates in the sediment interstitial water are one or more orders of magnitude different for these two geological substrata averaging 139.2 and 14.9 M of CH<sub>4</sub> and 0.08 and 11.53 mM of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> on alluvial sands and limestone respectively. The amount of methane found in the internal atmosphere of plants from alluvial sands is significantly higher (6.3 M) than in plants from limestone (0.19 M). The average methane emissions measured in wetlands located on alluvial sands were 25.2 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> while emissions from marshes on limestone were only 2.4 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. These values extrapolated for the entire year and the respective wetland areas resulted in the estimate of total CH4 emissions from northern Belize of 0.066 Tg per year. 
20055247|The influence of individual tree species on base-cation (Ca, Mg, K, Na) distribution and cycling was examined in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), basswood (Tilia americana L.), and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) in old-growth northern hardwood -- hemlock forests on a sandy, mixed, frigid, Typic Haplorthod over two growing seasons in northwestern Michigan. Base cations in biomass, forest floor, and mineral soil (0-15 cm and 15-40 cm) pools were estimated for five replicated trees of each species; measured fluxes included bulk precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, litterfall, forest-floor leachate, mineralization + weathering, shallow-soil leachate, and deep-soil leachate. The three species differed in where base cations had accumulated within the single-tree ecosystems. Within these three single-tree ecosystems, the greatest quantity of base cations in woody biomass was found in sugar maple, whereas hemlock and basswood displayed the greatest amount in the upper 40 cm of mineral soil. Base-cation pools were ranked: sugar maple &gt basswood, hemlock in woody biomass; sugar maple, basswood &gt hemlock in foliage; hemlock &gt sugar maple, basswood in the forest floor, and basswood &gt sugar maple, hemlock in the mineral soil. Base-cation fluxes in throughfall, stemflow, the forest-floor leachate, and the deep-soil leachate (2000 only) were ranked: basswood &gt sugar maple &gt hemlock. Our measurements suggest that species-related differences in nutrient cycling are sufficient to produce significant differences in base-cation contents of the soil over short time intervals (&lt65 years). Moreover, these species-mediated differences may be important controls over the spatial pattern and edaphic processes of northern hardwood-hemlock ecosystems in the upper Great Lakes region.
1469972|Our objectives were to quantify and compare soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux of two dominant soil types in an old-growth neotropical rain forest in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica, and to evaluate the control of environmental factors on CO<sub>2</sub> release. We measured soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux from eight permanent soil chambers on six Oxisol sites. Three sites were developed on old river terraces ('old alluvium') and the other three were developed on old lava flows ('residual'). At the same time we measured soil CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, soil water content and soil temperature at various depths in 6 soil shafts (3 m deep). Between 'old alluvium' sites, the two-year average CO<sub>2</sub> flux rates ranged from 117.3 to 128.9 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Significantly higher soil CO<sub>2</sub> flux occurred on the 'residual' sites (141.1 to 184.2 mg C m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Spatial differences in CO<sub>2</sub> efflux were related to fine root biomass, soil carbon and phosphorus concentration but also to soil water content. Spatial variability in CO<sub>2</sub> storage was high and the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> stored in the upper and lower soil profile was different between 'old alluvial' and 'residual' sites. The major factor identified for explaining temporal variations in soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux was soil water content. During periods of high soil water content CO<sub>2</sub> emission decreased, probably due to lower diffusion and CO<sub>2</sub> production rates. During the 2-year study period inter-annual variation in soil CO<sub>2</sub> efflux was not detected.
1468823|<sup>15</sup>N-ammonium sulphate equivalent to 0.5 kg N/ha was added as a tracer to lysimeters containing the organic horizons of an acid forest soil. The effect of logging debris (brash), vegetation and second rotation Picea sitchensis seedlings on the amount of the <sup>15</sup>N found in various soil, vegetation and leachate pools was followed over a period of 60 days. Transformation of <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium to nitrate occurred within 24 hours. Although total nitrate leachate losses were high, tracer-derived nitrate represented only 0.4%-4.2% of the applied <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium. The atom% excess of the KCl-extractable organic-N pool was initially lower than for the inorganic species but due to the large pool size, consistently represented 3-6% of the applied <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium. The similarity of the atom% excess of the ammonium and nitrate pools indicated an autotrophic nitrification pathway. A significant proportion of the <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium passed through the microbial biomass which contained between 16 and 48% of the <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium 2 days after addition of the <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium. This nitrogen was in a readily available form or short-term pool for the first two weeks (with no change in the overall biomass pool), after which the nitrogen appeared to become transformed into more stable compounds representing a long-term pool. Total recovery of the <sup>15</sup>N was between 68% and 99% for the different treatments. The presence of brash reduced microbial immobilisation of the <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium and total retention in the organic matter. This is suggested to be a consequence of greater nitrification and denitrification rate in organic horizons beneath a brash covering due to different microclimatic conditions.
1469864|This paper provides a global synthesis of reactive nitrogen (Nr) loading to the continental landmass and subsequent riverine nitrogen fluxes under a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance, from pre-industrial to contemporary. A mass balance model of nitrogen loading to the landmass is employed to account for transfers of Nr between atmospheric input sources (as food and feed products) and subsequent consumer output loads. This calculation produces a gridded surface of nitrogen loading ultimately mobilizable to aquatic systems (Nmob). Compared to the pre-industrial condition, nitrogen loading to the landmass has doubled from 111 to 223 Tg/year due to anthropogenic activities. This is particularly evident in the industrialized areas of the globe where contemporary levels of nitrogen loading have increased up to 6-fold in many areas. The quantity of nitrogen loaded to the landscape has shifted from a chiefly fixation-based system (89% of total loads) in the pre-industrial state to a heterogeneous mix in contemporary times where fertilizer (15%), livestock (24%) and atmospheric deposition (15%) dominate in many parts of the industrialized and developing world. A nitrogen transport model is developed from a global database of drainage basin characteristics and a comprehensive compendium of river chemistry observations. The model utilizes constituent delivery coefficients based on basin temperature and hydraulic residence times in soils, rivers, lakes and reservoirs to transport nitrogen loads to river mouths. Fluxes are estimated for total nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and total organic nitrogen. Model results show that total nitrogen fluxes from river basins have doubled from 21 Tg/year in the pre-industrial to 40 Tg/year in the contemporary period, with many industrialized areas of the globe showing an increase up to 5-fold. DIN fluxes from river basins have increased 6-fold from 2.4 Tg/year in the pre-industrial to 14.5 Tg/year in the contemporary period. The amount of nitrogen loading delivered to river mouth as flux is greatly influenced by both basin temperatures and hydraulic residence times suggesting a regional sensitivity to loading. The global, aggregate nitrogen retention on the continental land mass is 82%, with a range of 0-100% for individual basins. We also present the first seasonal estimates of riverine nitrogen fluxes at the global scale based on monthly discharge as the primary driver.
40980883|Because ombrotrophic peat bogs receive inputs of water, nutrients, pollutants, and xerobiotic materials solely from the atmosphere, and accumulate organic matter vertically, dated peat cores can provide a historical record of deposition. We propose a novel method for accurately determining dates of peat, based on cosmogenic Be. In a laboratory study, we document limited post-depositional mobility of atmospherically-deposited Be, a requisite for Be dating. We provide an example of how the Pb-dated upper portion of a peat core can be used to back-calculate a site-specific Be deposition rate, which can then be used to estimate dates for peat throughout a core, and also discuss limitations to the application of cosmogenic Be to the dating of peat deposits.
40343523|Roots influence root litter decomposition through multiple belowground processes. Hydraulic lift or redistribution (HR) by plants is one such process that creates diel drying-rewetting cycles in soil. However, it is unclear if this phenomenon influences decomposition. Since decomposition in deserts is constrained by low soil moisture and is stimulated when dry soils are rewetted, we hypothesized that diel drying-rewetting, via HR, stimulates decomposition of root litter. We quantified the decomposition of root litter from two desert shrubs, Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata and Sarcobatus vermiculatus, during spring and summer in field soil core treatments designed to have abundant roots and high magnitude HR cycles (DenseRoot) or few roots and low magnitude HR (SparseRoot). To help explain our decomposition results, we not only evaluated HR, but multiple factors (i.e., soil moisture, soil temperature, dissolved soil organic C concentrations, and litter chemistry) that are often influenced by roots and regulate decomposition. Root length density in the DenseRoot treatment was at least four times higher than in the SparseRoot treatment for both Artemisia and Sarcobatus by the beginning of spring. During spring and summer, there was only one instance when decomposition rates differed between the treatments. This occurred in soils beneath Artemisia in the summer when decomposition rates were 25% higher in the DenseRoot than in the SparseRoot treatments. Of the factors evaluated, only a threefold increase in the magnitude of drying-rewetting cycles created by HR in the DenseRoot compared to the SparseRoot treatment coincided with this change in decomposition. Additionally, the lower soil
23359768|Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is rapidly increasing in tropical regions. We investigated how a decade of experimental N addition (125 kg N ha -1 year -1 ) to a seasonal lowland forest affected depth distribution and contents of soil nitrous oxide (N 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ), as well as natural abundance isotopic signatures of N 2 O, nitrate (NO 3 - ) and ammonium (NH 4 + ). In the control plots during dry season, we deduced limited N 2 O production by denitrification in the topsoil (0.050.40 m) as indicated by: ambient N 2 O concentrations and ambient 15 N-N 2 O signatures, low water-filled pore space (3560%), and similar 15 N signatures of N 2 O and NO 3 - . In the subsoil (0.402.00 m), we detected evidence of N 2 O reduction to N 2 during upward diffusion, indicating denitrification activity. During wet season, we found that N 2 O at 0.052.00 m was mainly produced by denitrification with substantial further reduction to N 2 , as indicated by: lighter 15 N-N 2 O than 15 N-NO 3 - throughout the profile, and increasing N 2 O concentrations with simultaneously decreasing 15 N-N 2 O enrichment with depth. These interpretations were supported by an isotopomer map and by a positive correlation between 18 O-N 2 O and 15 N-N 2 O site preferences. Long-term N addition did not affect dry-season soil N 2 O-N contents, doubled wet-season soil N 2 O-N contents, did not affect 15 N signatures of NO 3 - , and reduced wet-season 15 N signatures of N 2 O compared to the control plots. These suggest that the increased NO 3 - concentrations have stimulated N 2 O production and decreased N 2 O-to-N 2 reduction. Soil CO 2 -C contents did not differ between treatments, implying that N addition essentially did not influence soil C cycling. The pronounced seasonality in soil respiration was largely attributable to enhanced topsoil respiration as indicated by a wet-season increase in the topsoil CO 2 -C contents. The N-addition plots showed reduced dry-season soil CH 4 -C contents and threshold CH 4 concentrations were reached at a shallower depth compared to the control plots, revealing an N-induced stimulation of methanotrophic activity. However, the net soil CH 4 uptake rates remained similar between treatments possibly because diffusive CH 4 supply from the atmosphere largely limited CH 4 oxidation.
1469525|In rice microcosms (Oryza sativa, var. Roma, type japonica), CH<sub>4</sub> emission, CH<sub>4</sub> production, CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation and CH<sub>4</sub> accumulation were measured over an entire vegetation period. Diffusive CH<sub>4</sub> emission was measured in closed chambers, CH<sub>4</sub> production was measured in soil samples, CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation was determined from the difference between oxic and anoxic emissions, and CH<sub>4</sub> accumulation was measured by analysis of porewater and gas bubbles. The sum of diffusive CH<sub>4</sub> emission, CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation, and CH<sub>4</sub> accumulation was only 60% of the cumulative CH<sub>4</sub> production. The two values diverged during the first 50 days (vegetative phase) and then again during the last 50 days (late reproductive phase and senescence) of the 150 day vegetation period. During the period of day 50-100 (early reproductive phase/flowering), the processes were balanced. Most likely, gas bubbles and diffusion limitation are responsible for the divergence in the early and late phases. The effect of rice on CH<sub>4</sub> production rates and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations was studied by measuring these processes also in unplanted microcosms. Presence of rice plants lowered the CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations, but had no net effect on the CH<sub>4</sub> production rates.
25652610|To clarify the reason for the higher CH uptake rate in Japanese forest soils, twenty-seven sites were established for CH flux measurement. The first order rate constant for CH uptake was also determined using soil core incubation at 14 sites. The CH uptake rate had a seasonal fluctuation, high in summer and low in winter, and the rate correlated with soil temperature at 17 sites. The annual CH uptake rates ranged from 2.7 to 24.8 kg CH ha y (the average of these rates was 9.7 or 10.9 kg CH ha y, depending on method of calculation), which is somewhat higher than the uptake rates reported in previous literature. The averaged CH uptake rate correlated closely with the CH oxidation rate of the topsoil (05 cm) in the study sites. The CH oxidation constant of the topsoil was explained by a multiple regression model using total pore volume of the soil, nitrate content, and C/N ratio (p < 0.05, R = 0.684). This result and comparison with literature data suggest that the high CH uptake rate in Japanese forest soils depends on the high porosity probably due to volcanic ash parent materials. According to our review of the literature, the CH uptake rate in temperate forests in Europe is significantly different from that in Asia and North America. A new global CH uptake rate in temperate forests was estimated to be 5.4 Tg y (1 SE is 1.1 Tg y) on a continental basis.
1469300|In order to determine the effect of increased nitrogen inputs on fluxed of N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> from alpine soils, we measured fluxes of these gases from fertilized and unfertilized soils in wet and dry alpine meadows. In the dry meadow, the addition of nitrogen resulted in a 22-fold increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, while in the wet meadow, we observed a 45-fold increase in N<sub>2</sub>O emission rates. CH<sub>4</sub> uptake in the dry meadow was reduced 52% by fertilization; however, net CH<sub>4</sub> production occurred in all the wet meadow plots and emission rates were not significantly affected by fertilization. Net nitrification rates in the dry meadow were higher in fertilized plots than in non-fertilized plots throughout the growing season; net mineralization rates in fertilized dry meadow pots were higher than those in non-fertilized plots during the latter half of the growing season.
24715149|Soil carbon (C) fluxes, soil respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) leaching were explored along the young Damma glacier forefield chronosequence (7128 years) over a three-year period. To gain insight into the sources of soil CO effluxes, radiocarbon signatures of respired CO were measured and a vegetation-clipping experiment was performed. Our results showed a clear increase in soil CO effluxes with increasing site age from 9  1 to 160  67 g COC m year, which was linked to soil C accumulation and development of vegetation cover. Seasonal variations of soil respiration were mainly driven by temperature; between 62 and 70 % of annual CO effluxes were respired during the 4-month long summer season. Sources of soil CO effluxes changed along the glacier forefield. For most recently deglaciated sites, radiocarbon-based age estimates indicated ancient C to be the dominant source of soil-respired CO. At intermediate site age (5878 years), the contribution of new plant-fixed C via rhizosphere respiration amounted up to 90 %, while with further soil formation, heterotrophically respired C probably from accumulated 'older' soil organic carbon (SOC) became increasingly important. In comparison with soil respiration, DOC leaching at 10 cm depth was small, but increased similarly from 0.4  0.02 to 7.4  1.6 g DOC m year over the chronosequence. A strong rise of the ratio of SOC to secondary iron and aluminium oxides strongly suggests that increasing DOC leaching with site age results from a faster increase of the DOC source, SOC, than of the DOC sink, reactive mineral surfaces. Overall, C losses from soil by soil respiration and DOC leaching increased from 9  1 to 70  17 and further to 168  68 g C m year at the <10, 5878, and 110128 year old sites. By comparison, total ecosystem C stocks increased from 0.2 to 1.1 and to 3.1 kg C m from the young to intermediate and old sites. Therefore, the ecosystem evolved from a dominance of C accumulation in the initial phase to a high throughput system. We suggest that the relatively strong increase in soil C stocks compared to C fluxes is a characteristic feature of initial soil formation on freshly exposed rocks.
1468668|A field fertilization experiment demonstrated that growth of Larrea tridentata was not limited by phosphorus, even though soils contained high levels of pedogenic carbonates that can potentially fix high amounts of phosphorus. Nutrient reabsorption efficiencies in unfertilized shrubs ranged from 72-86% for P, making nutrient reabsorption a very effective nutrient conservation mechanism. Absolute amounts of N and P reabsorption increased with N and P concentrations in leaves, with reabsorption being greater during drought stress than during rapid leaf growth. However, only N reabsorption efficiency increased with increasing plant N status. A model was developed to explain patterns of nutrient reabsorption efficiencies over large gradients in nutrient availability.
20055245|Depth profiles of oxygen concentration and the redox status of acid-extractable iron were measured in littoral sediment cores of Lake Constance incubated under a light-dark regimen of 12 h. While oxygen penetrated to 3.4  0.2 mm depth in the dark, photosynthetic oxygen production shifted the oxic-anoxic interface down to 4.0  0.2 mm or 5.9  1.6 mm depth, at low or high light intensity, respectively, and caused a net oxygen efflux into the water column. After a light-dark or dark-light transition, the oxygen concentration at the sediment surface reached a new steady state within about 20 min. The redox state of the bioavailable iron was determined in 1-mm slices of sediment subcores. After a dark period of 12 h, 85% of the acid-extractable iron (10.5 mol
41410596|Litter decay rates are often correlated with the initial lignin:N or lignin:cellulose content of litter, suggesting that interactions between lignin and more labile compounds are important controls over litter decomposition. The chemical composition of lignin may influence these interactions, if lignin physically or chemically protects labile components from microbial attack. We tested the effect of lignin chemical composition on litter decay in the field during a year-long litterbag study using the model system Arabidopsis thaliana. Three Arabidopsis plant types were used, including one with high amounts of guaiacyl-type lignin, one with high aldehyde-and p hydroxyphenyl-type lignin, and a wild type control with high syringyl-type lignin. The high aldehyde litter lost significantly more mass than the other plant types, due to greater losses of cellulose, hemicellulose, and N. Aldehyde-rich lignins and p-hydroxyphenyl-type lignins have low levels of cross-linking between lignins and polysaccharides, supporting the hypothesis that chemical protection of labile polysaccharides and N is a mechanism by which lignin controls total litter decay rates. 2D NMR of litters showed that lignin losses were associated with the ratio of guaiacyl-to-p-hydroxyphenyl units in lignin, because these units polymerize to form different amounts of labile- and recalcitrant-linkages within the lignin polymer. Different controls over lignin decay and polysaccharide and N decay may explain why lignin:N and lignin:cellulose ratios can be better predictors of decay rates than lignin content alone.
23359766|Land-use change alters catchment hydrology by influencing the quality and quantity of partitioned rainfall. We compared rainfall partitioning (throughfall, stemflow and interception) and nutrient concentrations in rainfall, throughfall and stemflow in three land-use types [primary forest (PF), secondary forest (SF) and agriculture (A)] in Panama. Measurements of throughfall were highly variable which may have masked seasonal and land use differences but it was clear that throughfall at agricultural sites made up a larger proportion of gross precipitation than at forest sites. Of incident precipitation, 94% became throughfall in agriculture sites while 83 and 81% of gross precipitation became throughfall in PF and SF, respectively. The size of the precipitation event was the main driver of variation in throughfall and stemflow. Consistent patterns in nutrient cycling were also difficult to identify. Vegetation has a vital role in delivering nutrients as throughfall deposition of K was often larger than precipitation deposition. A canopy budget model indicated that canopy exchange was often more dominant than dry deposition. Throughfall was generally enriched with nutrients, especially K and Mg, with enrichment factors of up to 17 and 5 for K and Mg, respectively, in PF. In contrast, Ca was sometimes taken up by the canopy. Values of nutrient deposition were high (with up to 15, 3, 30 and 15 kg ha -1 month -1 in stand deposition of Ca, Mg, K and Na, respectively in PF), possibly due to the slash- and-burn agricultural practices in the area or marine inputs. Throughfall and stemflow are vital sources of nutrients in these ecosystems.
1469098| Bacterial utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was studied in water from a humic and a clearwater oligotrophic lake. Indigenous bacteria were inoculated into either 0.2 m natural filtered lake water, or lake water enriched fivefold with colloidal DOM > 100 kD but below 0.2 m. Consumption of DOM was followed from changes in concentrations of total dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved combined and free carbohydrates and amino acids (DCCHO and DFCHO, and DCAA and DFAA, respectively) and by uptake of monosaccharide and amino acid radioisotopes. DCCHO and DCAA made up 8% (humic lake) to 33-44% (clear-water lake) of the natural DOC pools, while DFCHO and DFAA contributed at most 1.7% to the DOC pools. Addition of > 100 kD DOM increased the DOC concentrations by 50% (clearwater lake) to 92% (humic lake), but it only resulted in a higher bacterial production (by 63%) in the humic lake. During the incubations 13 to 37% of the DOC was assimilated by the bacteria, at estimated growth efficiencies of 4-8%. Despite the measured reduction of DOC, statistically significant changes of specific organic compounds, especially of DCCHO and DCAA, generally did not occur. Probably the presence of high molecular weight DOC interfered with the applied analytical procedures. Addition of radiotracers indicated, however, that DFAA sustained 17-58% and 29-100% of the bacterial carbon and nitrogen requirements, respectively, and that glucose met 1-3% of the bacterial carbon requirements. Thus, our experiments indicate that radiotracers, rather than measurements of concentration changes, should be used in studies of bacterial utilization of DOC in freshwaters with a high content of humic or high molecular weight organic matter. 
24716797|Current estimates of CO outgassing from Amazonian rivers and streams have considerable uncertainty since they are based on limited-time surveys of pCO measurements along the Amazon mainstem and mouths of major tributaries, using conservative estimates of gas exchange velocities. In order to refine basin-scale CO efflux estimates from Amazonian rivers, we present a long time (5-year) dataset of direct measurements of CO fluxes, gas transfer velocities and pCO measurements in seven representative rivers of the lowland Amazon basin fluvial network, six non-tidal (Negro, Solimes, Teles Pires, Cristalino, Araguaia and Javas) and one tidal river (Caxiuan), with sizes ranging from 4th to 9th order. Surveys were conducted from January 2006 to December 2010, in a total of 389 campaigns covering all stages of their hydrographs. CO fluxes and gas transfer velocities (k) were measured using floating chambers and pCO was measured simultaneously by headspace extraction followed by gas chromatography analysis. Results show high CO flux rate variability among rivers and hydrograph stages, ranging from 0.8 to 15.3 mol CO m s, with unexpected negative fluxes in clear-water rivers during low waters. Non-tidal rivers showed marked seasonal CO flux patterns, with significantly higher exchange during high waters. Seasonality was modulated by pCO, which was positive and strongly correlated with discharge. In these rivers k was well correlated with wind speed, which allowed the use of wind data to model k. We estimate a release of 360  60 Tg C year from Amazonian rivers and streams within a 1.47 million km quadrant in the central lowland Amazon. Extrapolating these values to the basin upstream of bidos, results in an outgassing of 0.8 Pg C to the atmosphere each year. Our results are a step forward in achieving more accurate gas emission values for Amazonian rivers and their role in the annual carbon budget of the Amazon basin.
1469670|Autonomous, in situ sensors for the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2</sub>) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were deployed in a freshwater lake during the winters of 1997 and 1998 to evaluate magnitude and sources of variability during ice-covered periods. Gas variability on diel or shorter time scales was small or undetectable during most of the deployment periods, only becoming significant prior to ice-out when runoff and light penetration increased, promoting convective currents and biological production. A surprising 7.6 d period oscillation, apparently driven by a baroclinic seiche, dominated the short-term variability during the first year. The gas trends associated with the seiche oscillations and periodic profile measurements revealed that ice formation led to gas gradients directly under the ice. Long-term variability was characterized by increasing CO<sub>2</sub> and decreasing DO as a consequence of biological oxidation of organic matter. The results suggest that both spatial and temporal variability can be significant over intervals which would not be resolved by traditional sampling-based studies.
1468996| The abundance and distribution of dissolved CH<sub>4</sub> were determined from 1987-1990 in Lake Fryxell, Antarctica, an amictic, permanently ice-covered lake in which solute movement is controlled by diffusion. CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were < 1 M in the upper oxic waters, but increased below the oxycline to 936 M at 18 m. Sediment CH<sub>4</sub> was 1100 mol (1 sed)<sup>-1</sup> in the 0-5 cm zone. Upward flux from the sediment was the source of the CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and DOC in the water column; CH<sub>4</sub> was 27% of the DOC + CH<sub>4</sub> carbon at 18 m. Incubations with surficial sediments indicated that H<sup>14</sup>CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction was 0.4 mol (1 sed)<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> or 4x the rate of acetate fermentation to CH<sub>4</sub>. There was no measurable CH<sub>4</sub> production in the water column. However, depth profiles of CH<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and DIC normalized to bottom water concentrations demonstrated that a significant CH<sub>4</sub> sink was evident in the anoxic, sulfate-containing zone of the water column (10-18 m). The  <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> in this zone decreased from -72  at 18 m to -76  at 12 m, indicating that the consumption mechanism did not result in an isotopic enrichment of <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub>. In contrast,  <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> increased to -55  at 9 m due to aerobic oxidation, though this was a minor aspect of the CH<sub>4</sub> cycle. The water column CH<sub>4</sub> profile was modeled by coupling diffusive flux with a first order consumption term; the best-fit rate constant for anaerobic CH<sub>4</sub> consumption was 0.012 yr<sup>-1</sup>. On a total carbon basis, CH<sub>4</sub> consumption in the anoxic water column exerted a major effect on the flux of carbonaceous material from the underlying sediments and serves to exemplify the importance of CH<sub>4</sub> to carbon cycling in Lake Fryxell. 
41490509|Fluorescence quenching of the fluorescence is a useful method to determine copper complexing properties of the dissolved organic matter. This technique provides express results often by choosing one or two excitation-emission fluorescence measurement for a straight range of concentration. That why it is not representative of the whole sample On another hand, using total luminescence spectra gives lots of information that is difficult to manipulate in term of complexing properties. This work focus on a fluorescence quenching experiment carried out on a filtered black water from Rio Negro from north Brazil (Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira) using excitation emission matrix of fluorescence (EEMF) with a large range of copper concentration. Indeed, metal additions were performed using logarithmic increments of the total copper concentration to cover a wide range of concentration from 1.7 x 10 to 10 mol P. These data were treated by two different ways for comparison: on the one hand, data treatment were computed, as usually, at different fluorescence intensity positions using multi-response wavelength method with two ligand, and, on the another hand, a statistical method, parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), was applied to extract fluorescent component. Then a fitting was done on these PARAFAC components with one or two complexing sites each one. Results show that PARAFAC enables quantitative evaluation of complexing parameters for copper as good as certain multi-response methods: L1 T 16.2 x 10 mol 1 (5.0 < log(K < 5.8) and L T 3.0 x 10 mol 1 (2.8 < log (K) < 3.9). PARAFAC confirms that for this natural sample only two fluorescent ligands are present with two types of site for each component. No residual fluorescence was detected by the statistical treatment. Wall surface interferences were pointed-out as phenomenon to be solve to overcome the limiting efficiency of the total copper concentration range.
4151485|Both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and iron play an important role in biogeochemical processes in lacustrine benthic environments. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that both substances can act as active reductants in the redox transformation of organic pollutants. This paper examines the nature and abundance of DOC and dissolved ferrous iron (Fe
40343529|The Siak is a black water river in central Sumatra, Indonesia, which owes its brown color to dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from surrounding, heavily disturbed peat soils. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations measured during five expeditions in the Siak between 2004 and 2006 are among the highest reported world wide. The DOM decomposition appeared to be a main factor influencing the oxygen concentration in the Siak which showed values down to 12 mol 1. Results derived from a box-diffusion model indicated that in addition to the DOC concentration and the associated DOM decomposition the water-depth also plays a crucial role in regulating the oxygen levels in the river because of its impact on the turbulence in the aquatic boundary layer and the surface/volume ratio of water in the river. Model results imply furthermore that a reduced water-depth could counteract an increased oxygen consumption caused by an enhanced DOM leaching during the transition from dry to wet periods. This buffer mechanism seems to be close to its limits as indicated by sensitivity studies which showed in line with measured data that an increase of the DOC concentrations by ~ 15% could already lead to anoxic conditions in the Siak. This emphasizes the sensitivity of the Siak against further peat soil degradation, which is assumed to increase DOC concentrations in the rivers.

1468898|The Caura River, a major tributary of the Orinoco River, was sampled at bi-weekly intervals for two years. Because the watershed is covered with undisturbed forest overlying a Precambrian shield, the water of the Caura River has low conductivity (mean, 15 uS/cm), contains small amounts of particulate material (mean, 11 mg/l), and is slightly acidic (median pH, 6.8). Concentrations of total dissolved solids vary less than two-fold in response to the seasonal ten-fold variation in discharge; concentrations of particulate material vary more (ten-fold) and are lowest at the time of peak discharge. Seasonal changes in concentrations of Si, major metal cations, and hydrogen ion are complementary to each other and indicate regular seasonal changes in weathering rates. Measurements of bulk atmospheric deposition and the observed runoff yield of Cl and S were used in estimating the basin-wide atmospheric deposition of major elements, which were as follows (kg/ha/yr): Ca, 1.3; Mg, 0.29; Na, 8.2; K, 1.0; Cl, 12; S, 2.8; P, 0.14. Element ratios show that terrestrial sources contribute strongly to the atmospheric deposition of Ca, K, S, and P. From the atmospheric contributions and runoff yields, watershed retention was computed for major elements with reference to Si. The watershed accumulates Al, Fe, and P, whereas losses of Ca, Mg, Na, K, and S originating from non-atmospheric sources exceed the relative loss rates of Si. The rock weathering rate based on Si is 1.8 cm/1,000 years. Although significant amounts of Ca, Mg, Na, and K are found in atmospheric deposition, the dominant influence on the mass balances of these elements is weathering rather than deposition. Weathering has a trivial influence on the cycles of Cl and S. Both atmospheric deposition and weathering are important in the mass balance of P. The ecosystem does not effectively conserve most biologically active elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K). The ecosystem conserves significant amounts of phosphorus (31% of total input), but probably by abiotic mechanisms.
20055238|Coarse woody debris (CWD) may play a role in nutrient cycling in temperate forests through the leaching of solutes, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), to the underlying soil. These fluxes need to be considered in element budget calculations, and have the potential to influence microbial activity, soil development, and other processes in the underlying soil, but studies on leaching from CWD are rare. In this study, we collected throughfall, litter leachate, and CWD leachate in situ at a young mixed lowland forest in NY State, USA over one year. We measured the concentrations of DOC, DON, NH, NO, dissolved organic sulfur,
1469908| The spatial and temporal distribution of Dimethylsulfide (DMS), Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) - its precursor -, Dimethylsulfoxyde (DMSO) - one of its oxidation products - Carbonyl sulfide (COS) and Carbonyl disulfide (CS<sub>2</sub>) were investigated during nine oceanographic cruises carried out in six major tidal European estuaries between July 1996 and May 1998. Low levels of DMS were recorded (mean of 0.6 nM, standard deviation () 0.3 nM) during these 9 cruises. Positive correlations between DMS and salinity were frequently observed, with the highest DMS concentrations in the plume of estuaries, which could be explained by change in phytoplankton speciation from estuarine to shelf waters. Strong correlation between DMSP and DMS was reported for most of the estuaries denoting a simple conservative mixing of riverine and marine waters controlled by tide. In contrast to DMS, significant levels of COS and CS<sub>2</sub> with mean concentrations of 220  150 (pM; pM=10<sup>-12</sup> M) and 256 pM respectively were recorded in four estuaries, indicating that estuaries could be a significant source of these compounds. 
20519845|MBL-MEL, a simple model of ecosystem biogeochemistry, is amended and applied to plant and soil C, N and N data for the summers of 2001-2003 from Brandalpynten, a maritime high Arctic site on Svalbard following the application of N (99 atom%) as NO-N at or NH-N at concentrations of 1 or 5 kg N ha. Variants of this Parent model are also developed to incorporate: temperature dependence into equations describing nutrient fluxes (Temp model); cryptogams (Cryp model); both features combined (CrypTemp model). Goodness-of-fit (GOF) statistics suggest that the addition of temperature-dependence improves the utility of models with and without cryptogams: the residual weighted sums of squares per data point were 5.69, 3.91, 4.31 and 3.93 for the Parent, Temp, Cryp and CrypTemp models respectively. The application of model selection criteria confirm that the addition of temperature-dependence also improves model generalisability. Across all models, the principal discrepancies between observation and prediction are associated with the inorganic soil N pool. We conclude that models in which fluxes are described using simple equations that can be augmented to include additional complexity, are an ideal starting point from which the relationship between GOF and model generalisability can be assessed.
1469106|Mass balances of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) based on stream and precipitation inputs and outflows were measured for seven unproductive lakes in central Ontario between 1981 and 1989. Net annual CO<sub>2</sub> evasion occurred in six of the seven study lakes with minor net invasion in the seventh. Atmospheric invasion might have been significant at certain times of the year, particularly during the growing season. Net evasion rates were greater than DIC loading rates, indicating partial mineralization of the terrestrially-derived DOC in the lakes. A steady state mass balance model adequately described the variation in DOC retention between lakes. Net annual carbon accumulation of forest communities based on estimates of net ecosystem production may be overestimated because of significant export of carbon to lakes via streams and groundwater, particularly in catchments with extensive peatlands.
20055165|This study reports the linkage between MIKE SHE and Wetland-DNDC for carbon dynamics and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions simulation in forested wetland. Wetland-DNDC was modified by parameterizing management measures, refining anaerobic biogeochemical processes, and was linked to the hydrological model -- MIKE SHE. As a preliminary application, we simulated the effect of water table position and forest management practices on GHGs emissions and carbon dynamics to test the capabilities of the models for simulating seasonal and long-term carbon budget. Simulation results show that water table changes had a remarkable effect on GHGs fluxes. Anaerobic conditions in forested wetland soils reduce organic matter decomposition and stimulate CH production. Decrease in the water table from the wetland surface decreases methane flux, while CO emission was lower with a rise in the water table. When there is a drop in water availability, wetlands can become a net source of atmospheric CO as photosynthesis is decreased and respiration loss enhanced. Forest management activities i.e. harvest, fertilization and reforestation practices were parameterized in the model. We predicted carbon fluxes and stores on a pine forest under different forest management scenarios during 160 years. Results show that average long-term carbon storage in ecosystem pools increased with increasing rotation length; Soil carbon showed only minor, long-term responses to harvesting events. In contrast, carbon sequestered in tree biomass and litter fluctuated widely, in concert with the harvest cycle. Application of nitrogen fertilizer increased average carbon storage in all ecosystem pools and wood products. We presented the linkage of MIKE SHE and Wetland-DNDC as a way to use of simulation modeling tools for assessing GHGs mitigation strategies, carbon budgeting and forest management.
40647931|The importance of lotie systems as sinks for nitrogen inputs is well recognized. A fraction of nitrogen in streamflow is removed to the atmosphere via denitrification with the remainder exported in streamflow as nitrogen loads. At the watershed scale, there is a keen interest in understanding the factors that control the fate of nitrogen throughout the stream channel network, with particular attention to the processes that deliver large nitrogen loads to sensitive coastal ecosystems. We use a dynamic stream transport model to assess biogeochemical (nitrate loadings, concentration, temperature) and hydrological (discharge, depth, velocity) effects on reach-scale denitrification and nitrate removal in the river networks of two watersheds having widely differing levels of nitrate enrichment but nearly identical discharges. Stream denitrification is estimated by regression as a nonlinear function of nitrate concentration, streamflow, and temperature, using more than 300 published measurements from a variety of US streams. These relations are used in the stream transport model to characterize nitrate dynamics related to denitrification at a monthly time scale in the stream reaches of the two watersheds. Results indicate that the nitrate removal efficiency of streams, as measured by the percentage of the stream nitrate flux removed via denitrification per unit length of channel, is appreciably reduced during months with high discharge and nitrate flux and increases during months of low-discharge and flux. Biogeochemical factors, including land use, nitrate inputs, and stream concentrations, are a major control on reach-scale denitrification, evidenced by the disproportionately lower nitrate removal efficiency in streams of the highly nitrate-enriched watershed as compared with that in similarly sized streams in the less nitrate-enriched watershed. Sensitivity analyses reveal that these important biogeochemical factors and physical hydrological factors contribute nearly equally to seasonal and stream-size related variations in the percentage of the stream nitrate flux removed in each watershed.
23359702|Concentrations of the secondary algal metabolite dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) and its breakdown product, the climate-active trace gas dimethylsulphide (DMS), are sensitive to changes in pCO 2 . Data on the response of marine macroalgae to future pCO 2 levels are lacking. Here we report the first measurements of DMSP and DMS production in two species of chlorophyte macroalgae (Ulva lactuca and U. clathrata). Laboratory cultures were grown in pHstated medium that received pulses of CO 2 to create pCO 2 conditions ranging from ambient (432 atm) to future (1514 atm). Intracellular concentration of DMSP remained unaffected in both species (101  21 and 69  20 mmol g -1 FW in U. lactuca and U. clathrata, respectively) but significant differences in extracellular production of DMSP and DMS were observed for U. lactuca: Whilst production of total DMSP (the sum of external DMSP and DMS) was different between replicated experiments, the percentage of total DMSP produced throughout each experiment increased significantly by up to 65% with increasing pCO 2 to 1514 atm. In contrast, DMS production decreased from 0.4 to 0.25 nmol g -1 FW h -1 . This decrease was not a linear function of pCO2 but an almost 50% step-wise loss of DMS production was indicated between 635 and 884 atm, a pCO 2 predicted for the next 100 years. Since Ulva spp. form massive harmful blooms ('green tides') that can occur free-floating and faraway (>100 km) from the coast, they may provide a locally significant source of DMS to the remote marine boundary layer.
1469581|Two Sphagnum moss species occupying hummock areas (Sphagnum capillifolium) and wetter hollows (Sphagnum recurvum) on a raised bog in north east Scotland were treated every two weeks with NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> solutions to supply 3g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Although S. recurvum moss contained a greater concentration of total P than S. capillifolium the amounts and N:P ratios were similar in both species. Larger amounts of total dissolved P (TDP) and molybdate reactive P (MRP) were extracted from beneath S. recurvum to 25 cm below the moss. Additions of N both increased and decreased the amounts of TDP at different times, and decreased MRP. The MRP fraction accounted for about 20 per cent of TDP and the difference was assumed to be in organic forms (DOP). Nitrogen addition had no effect on the amounts of DOP, but C:P ratios of this fraction changed with species, depth and N addition. Microbial P accounted for as much as 70 per cent of total P and showed seasonal variations, but no differences between the two moss species and N addition.
20519852|We monitored 24 storms during the period 1998-2002 in order to elucidate whether the origin of nitrate could be inferred from water sources in the catchment. The study was performed in the Fuirosos catchment (10.5 km) drained by an intermittent stream. Water sources were estimated through end member mixing analysis (EMMA) using chloride, sulfate and dissolved organic carbon as tracers. Three end members were identified in the catchment: event water, hillslope groundwater and riparian groundwater. Streamwater data encompassed the mixing space defined by the end members only during the 12 storms occurred during the wet period (from December to May). Water sources were related to stream nitrate concentrations during 6 of the 12 storms indicating a linkage between hydrological and nitrate sources. However, there was not a consistent pattern of a particular end member being a source of nitrate. EMMA was used to determine expected nitrate concentrations in stream water based on conservative mixing of the different water sources. The effect of the near- and in- stream zones on stream nitrate was inferred by comparing predicted nitrate concentrations to measured stream nitrate concentration. At discharges below 80 l s stream nitrate concentrations were lower than expected from catchment sources in 82% of the cases suggesting nitrate retention in the near stream zones. The trend was the opposite at higher discharges.
1468594|The chemistry of lakes and streams within the North Branch of the Moose River is strongly correlated with the nature and distribution of geologic materials in the watershed. The dominance of thin glacial till and granitic gneiss bedrock in the region north and east of Big Moose Lake results in a geologically sensitive terrain that is characterized by surface water with low alkalinity and chemical compositions only slightly modified from ambient precipitation. In contrast, extensive deposits of thick glacial till and stratified drift in the lower part of the system (e.g. Moss-Cascade valley) allow for much infiltration of precipitation to the groundwater system where weathering reactions increase alkalinity and significantly alter water chemistry. The hypothesis that surficial geology controls the chemistry of surface waters in the Adirondacks holds true for 70 percent of the Moose River watershed. Exceptions include the Windfall Pond subcatchment which is predominantly covered by thin till, yet has a high surface water alkalinity due to the presence of carbonate-bearing bedrock. The rapid reaction rates of carbonate minerals allow for complete acid neutralization to occur despite the short residence time of water moving through the system. Another important source of alkalinity in at least one of the subcatchments is sulfate reduction. This process appears to be most important in systems containing extensive peat deposits. An analysis of only those subcatchments controlled by the thickness of surficial sediments indicates that under current atmospheric loadings watersheds containing less than 3 percent thick surficial sediments will be acidic while those with up to 12 percent will be extremely sensitive to acidification and only those with over 50 percent will have a low sensitivity.
1469562|CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes during the winter were measured at natural and drained bog and fen sites in eastern Finland using both the closed chamber method and calculations of gas diffusion along a concentration gradient through the snowpack. The snow diffusion results were compared with those obtained by chamber, but the winter flux estimates were derived from chamber data only. CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from a poor bog were lower than those from an oligotrophic fen, while both CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes were higher in the Carex rostrata-occupied marginal (lagg) area of the fen than in the slightly less fertile centre. Average estimated winter CO<sub>2</sub>-C losses from virgin and drained forested peatlands were 41 and 68 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, accounting for 23 and 21% of the annual total CO<sub>2</sub> release from the peat. The mean release of CH<sub>4</sub>-C was 1.0 g in natural bogs and 3.4 g m<sup>-2</sup> in fens, giving rise to winter emissions averaging to 22% of the annual emission from the bogs and 10% of that from the fens. These wintertime carbon gas losses in Finnish natural peatlands were even greater than reported average long-term annual C accumulation values (less than 25 g C m<sup>-2</sup>). The narrow range of 10-30% of the proportion of winter CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from annual emissions found in Finnish peatlands suggest that a wider generalization in the boreal zone is possible. Drained forested bogs emitted 0.3 g CH<sub>4</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup> on the average, while the effectively drained fens consumed an average of 0.01 g CH<sub>4</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup>. Reason for the low CH<sub>4</sub> efflux or net oxidation in drained peatlands probably lies in low substrate supply and thus low CH<sub>4</sub> production in the anoxic deep peat layers. N<sub>2</sub>O release from a fertilized grassland site in November-May was 0.7 g N<sub>2</sub>O m<sup>-2</sup>, accounting for 38% of the total annual emission, while a forested bog released none and two efficiently drained forested fens 0.09 (28% of annual release) and 0.04 g N<sub>2</sub>O m<sup>-2</sup> (27%) during the winter, respectively.
1469713|Effects of the northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides) on surface soil characteristics were examined at the alpine site of Niwot Ridge, CO. We measured erosion of soil from gopher mounds and compared the characteristics of gopher mound (disturbed) and undisturbed soils in two major plant community types. Our measurements of erosion indicate long-term susceptibility of gopher-disturbed soils to redistribution by water and/or wind in this ecosystem. Ecosystem heterogeneity introduced by the gopher is reflected in significantly lower SOM in gopher mounds than in surrounding undisturbed soils, a characteristic which appears to be causally associated with other effects of gopher disturbance including changes in soil texture and significantly lower clays, total C, total N, total P, and labile P. In contrast to plant-available P, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was higher and steadily increased for the short term in both gopher mound soils and those beneath the mounds. These pools of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> then decreased to pre-disturbance levels by the following spring. Collectively our results indicate that, through the physical manipulation of soil and subsequent effects on soil resources, the northern pocket gopher functions as an agent of increased ecosystem heterogeneity and soil mass and nutrient redistribution at Niwot Ridge.
40343644|Rapid exchange of stream water and groundwater in streambeds creates hotspots of biogeochemical cycling of redox-sensitive solutes. Although stream-groundwater interaction can be increased through stream restoration, there are few detailed studies of the increased heterogeneity of water and solute fluxes through the streambed and associated patterns of biogeochemical processes around stream restoration structures. In this study, we examined the seasonal patterns of water and solute fluxes through the streambed around a stream restoration structure to relate patterns of water flux through the streambed to morphology of the channel and biogeochemical processes occurring in the bed. We characterized different biogeochemical zones in the streambed using principal component analysis (PCA) and examined the change in spatial patterns of these zones during different seasons. The PCA results show that two principal components summarized 83% of the variance in the original data set. Streambed pore water was characterized as oxic (indicating production of nitrate), anoxic (indicating sulfate, iron and manganese reduction), or stream-like (indicating there was minimal change in the stream water chemistry in the bed). Regardless of season of the year, anoxic zones were predominantly located upstream of the structure, in a low-velocity pool, and oxic zones were predominantly located downstream of the structure, in a turbulent riffle. We expect structures that span the full channel, are impermeable, and permanent, such as those installed in natural channel design restoration will similarly impact biogeochemical processing in the streambed. The installation of these types of restoration structures may be a way to increase the degree of biogeochemical cycling in stream ecosystems.
20519864|The input of phosphorus (P) through mineral aerosol dust deposition may be an important component of nutrient dynamics in tropical forest ecosystems. A new dust deposition calculation is used to construct a broad analysis of the importance of dust-derived P to the P budget of a montane wet tropical forest in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. The dust deposition calculation used here takes advantage of an internal geochemical signal (Sr isotope mass balance) to provide a spatially integrated longer-term average dust deposition flux. Dust inputs of P (0.23  0.08 kg ha year) are compared with watershed-average inputs of P to the soil through the conversion of underlying saprolite into soil (between 0.07 and 0.19 kg ha year), and with watershed-average losses of soil P through leaching (between 0.02 and 0.14 kg ha year) and erosion (between 0.04 and 1.38 kg ha year). The similar magnitude of dust-derived P inputs to that of other fluxes indicates that dust is an important component of the soil and biomass P budget in this ecosystem. Dust-derived inputs of P alone are capable of completely replacing the total soil and biomass P pool on a timescale of between 2.8 ka and 7.0 ka, less than both the average soil residence time ( 15 ka) and the average landslide recurrence interval ( 10 ka).
40343548|Quantitative knowledge of stabilization and decomposition processes is necessary to understand, assess and predict effects of land use changes on storage and stability of soil organic carbon (soil C) in the tropics. Although it is well documented that different soil types have different soil C stocks, it is presently unknown how different soil types affect the stability of recently formed soil C. Here, we analyze the main controls of soil C storage in the top 0.1 m of soils developed on Tertiary sediments and soils developed on volcanic ashes. Using a combination of fractionation techniques with C isotopes analyses we had the opportunity to trace origin and stability of soil carbon in different aggregate fractions under pasture and secondary forest. Soil C contents were higher in volcanic ash soils (47-130 g kg) than in sedimentary soils (19-50 g kg). Mean residence time (MRT) of forest-derived carbon in pastures increased from 37 to 57 years with increasing silt + clay content in sedimentary soils, but was independent from soil properties in volcanic ash soils. MRTs of pasture-derived carbon in secondary forests were considerably shorter, especially in volcanic ash soils, where no pasture-derived carbon could be detected in any of the four studied secondary forests. The implications of these results are that the MRT of recently incorporated organic carbon depends on clay mineralogy and is longer in soils dominated by smectite than non-crystalline minerals. Our results show that the presence of soil C stabilization processes, does not necessarily mean that recent incorporated soil C will also be effectively stabilized.
20456453|Forests soils should be neither sinks nor sources of carbon in a long-term perspective. From a Swedish perspective the time since the last glaciation has probably not been long enough to reach a steady state, although changes are currently very slow. In a shorter perspective, climatic and management changes over the past 100 years have probably created imbalances between litter input to soils and organic carbon mineralisation. Using extant data on forest inventories, we applied models to analyse possible changes in the carbon stocks of Swedish forest soils. The models use tree stocks to provide estimates of tree litter production, which are fed to models of litter decomposition and from which carbon stocks are calculated. National soil carbon stocks were estimated to have increased by 3 Tg yr or 12-13 g m yr in the period 1926-2000 and this increase will continue because soil stocks are far from equilibrium with current litter inputs. The figure obtained is likely to be an underestimation because wet sites store more carbon than predicted here and the inhibitory effect of nitrogen deposition on soil carbon mineralisation was neglected. Knowledge about site history prior to the calculation period determines the accuracy of current soil carbon stocks estimates, although changes can be more accurately estimated.
40980886|Data from long-term monitoring sites are vital for biogeochemical process understanding, and for model development. Implicitly or explicitly, information provided by both monitoring and modelling must be extrapolated in order to have wider scientific and policy utility. In many cases, large-scale modelling utilises little of the data available from long-term monitoring, instead relying on simplified models and limited, often highly uncertain, data for parameterisation. Here, we propose a new approach whereby outputs from model applications to long-term monitoring sites are upscaled to the wider landscape using a simple statistical method. For the 22 lakes and streams of the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN), standardised concentrations (Z scores) for Acid Neutralising Capacity (ANC), dissolved organic carbon, nitrate and sulphate show high temporal coherence among sites. This coherence permits annual mean solute concentrations at a new site to be predicted by back-transforming Z scores derived from observations or model applications at other sites. The approach requires limited observational data for the new site, such as annual mean estimates from two synoptic surveys. Several illustrative applications of the method suggest that it is effective at predicting long-term ANC change in upland surface waters, and may have wider application. Because it is possible to parameterise and constrain more sophisticated models with data from intensively monitored sites, the extrapolation of model outputs to policy relevant scales using this approach could provide a more robust, and less computationally demanding, alternative to the application of simple generalised models using extrapolated input data.
40343543|It has been recognized that subsurface lithology plays an important role in controlling nutrient cycling and transport in riparian zones. In Iowa and adjacent states, the majority of alluvium preserved in small and moderate sized valleys consists of Holocene-age organic-rich, and fine-grained loam. In this paper, we describe and evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of lithology and groundwater nutrient concentrations at a riparian well transect across Walnut Creek at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Jasper County, Iowa. Land treatment on one side of the stream reduced the grass cover to bare ground and allowed assessment of the effects of land management on nutrient concentrations. Results indicated that groundwater in Holocene alluvium is very nutrient rich with background concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon that exceed many environmentally sensitive criteria. Average concentrations of ammonium exceeded 1 mg/1 in several wells under grass cover whereas nitrate concentrations exceeded 20 mg/1 in wells under bare ground. Phosphate concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 1.3 mg/1 and DOC concentrations exceeded 5 mg/1 in many wells. Denitrification, channel incision, land management and geologic age of alluvium were found to contribute to variable nutrient loading patterns at the site. Study results indicated that riparian zones of incised streams downcutting through nutrient-rich Holocene alluvium can potentially be a significant source of nutrient loadings to streams.
40800618|We performed a meta-data analysis to investigate the importance of event based fluxes to DOC export from forested watersheds. A total of 30 small eastern United States forested watersheds with no wetland component, with a total of 5,176 DOC and accompanying discharge measurements were used in this analysis. There is a clear increase in DOC concentration during hydrologie events (storms and snow melt) that follows a power relationship. We estimate that 86% of DOC is exported during events. The majority (70%) of this event based DOC flux occurs during the rising hydrograph and during large events. Events with a discharge greater than 1.38 cm day  make up only 4.8% of the annual hydrograph, yet are responsible for 57% of annual DOC flux. The relationship between event discharge and both DOC concentration and flux is also regulated by temperature and antecedent conditions, with a larger response in both fluxes and concentrations to events during warmer periods and periods where the preceding discharge was low. The temperature relationship also shows seasonality indicating a potential link to the size or reactivity of watershed OM pools. The 86% of DOC lost during events represents a conservative estimate of the amount of allochthonous forested DOC transported laterally to streams. Future research on watershed cycling of DOC should take into account the importance of events in regulating the transport of DOC to downstream ecosystems, determine the relative importance of abiotic versus biotic processes for the temperature regulation of eventassociated DOC fluxes, and elucidate the interactions between processes that respond to climate on event versus longer time scales.
1468955| The effect of heating and autoclaving on extractable nitrogen, N mineralisation and C metabolism was studied by heating five forest soils in the laboratory, simulating the range of effects of heat due to bushfire. Top soil (0-5 cm) was heated to 60 C, 120 C and 250 C for 30 minutes; unheated soil was taken as a control. Samples of the soil heated to 250 C were also inoculated with fresh soil to accelerate the recovery of the microbial population. Soil autoclaving was carried out as another heat treatment (moist heat). Soils were analysed immediately after heating and 3 times during seven months of incubation to assess immediate and longer-term effects of heating. Extractable N (organic and mineral forms) increased after heating to 120 C, but decreased with further heating to 250 C suggesting the volatilisation of N. N associated with microbial biomass diminished with heating and was barely detectable after the 250 C treatment. Microbial biomass was an important source of soluble N in heated soils, and only partly recovered during subsequent long incubation. The amount of N mineralised during incubation depended on both soil and temperature. Nitrification did not occur when soils were heated to 250 C (with or without inoculum), or after autoclaving, demonstrating the high sensitivity of nitrifiers to heat. At the beginning of soil incubation, respiration was enhanced in heated soils (250 C, 250 C inoculated) and autoclaved soils, but after 30 days of incubation respiration decreased to values either similar to or lower than those in control. This respiration pattern indicated that a fraction of labile C was released by heating, which was quickly mineralised within 30 days of incubation. These results demonstrate some effects of soil heating on C and N dynamics in forest soils. 
1469520| Methane fluxes to the troposphere were measured in Lake Calado, a dendritic floodplain lake located in the central Amazon Basin. Methane concentrations in the surface water of the lake were less than 0.5 M during a period of high and rising water in April and May, except when episodic, deep mixing occurred and surficial concentrations reached as high as 4.8 M. Diffusive fluxes ranged from ca. 2-20 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> (mean: 6.6 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>) normally, but increased up to 220 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> during the passage of a rare cold front. During six weeks of rising water, the volume-weighted methane content of the lake increased during periods of stable thermal stratification (accumulation rates ranging from 16-1411 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>) and decreased during episodes of partial mixing (rates of decrease ranging from 63-1792 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>). Surface water methane concentrations during low and falling water in September varied by more than an order of magnitude (range, 0.3-9 M), and diffusive fluxes ranged from 3-158 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> (mean, 54 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>). During falling water in September, total methane flux from the lake to the troposphere measured with a floating chamber ranged from 53-328 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup> (mean, 163 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>). Ebullitive flux averaged 69% of total flux. Total methane flux was highest when thermal stratification was lost due to decreasing lake depth. 
41410603|Decomposition of leaf litter and its incorporation into the mineral soil are key components of the cycle in forest soils. In a C tracer experiment, we quantified the pathways of from decomposing leaf litter in calcareous soils of a mixed beech forest in the Swiss Jura. Moreover, we assessed how important the cold season is for the decomposition of freshly fallen leaves. The annual loss from the litter layer of 69-77% resulted mainly from the C minerlization (29-34% of the initial litter C) and from the transfer of litter material to the deeper mineral soil (> 4 cm) by soil fauna (30%). Although only 4-5% of the initial litter C was leached as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), this pathway could be important for the sequestration in soils in the long term: The DOC leached from the litter layer was mostly retained (95%) in the first 5 cm of the mineral soil by both physico-chemical sorption and biodegradation and, thus, it might have contributed significantly to the litter-derived recovered in the heavy fraction (> 1.6 g cm) at 0-4 cm depth (4% of the initial litter C). About 80% of the annual DOC leaching from the litter layer occurred during the cold season (Nov-April) due to an initial DOC flush of water-soluble substances. In contrast, the litter mineralization in winter accounted for only 25% of the annual losses through CO release from the labelled litter. Nevertheless, the highest contributions (45-60%) of litter decay to the heterotrophic soil respiration were observed on warm winter days when the mineral soil was still cold and the labile litter pool only partly mineralized. Our C tracing also revealed that: (1) the fresh litter C only marginally primed the mineralization of older SOM (> 1 year); and (2) nonlitter C, such as throughfall DOC, contributed significantly to the fluxes from the litter layer since the microbial biomass and the DOC leached from the litter layer contained 20-30% and up to 60% of unlabelled C, respectively. In summary, our study shows that significant amounts of recent leaf litter the cold season is clearly less important for the litter turnover than the warm season in this beech forest ecosystem.
1469358| We studied the chemical and optical changes in the dissolved organic matter (DOM) from two freshwater lakes and a Sphagnum bog after exposure to solar radiation. Stable carbon isotopes and solid-state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of DOM were used together with optical and chemical data to interpret results from experimental exposures of DOM to sunlight and from seasonal observations of two lakes in northeastern Pennsylvania. Solar photochemical oxidation of humic-rich bog DOM to smaller LMW compounds and to DIC was inferred from losses of UV absorbance, optical indices of molecular weight and changes in DOM chemistry. Experimentally, we observed a 1.2 enrichment in  <sup>13</sup>C and a 47% loss in aromatic C functionality in bog DOM samples exposed to solar UVR. Similar results were observed in the surface waters of both lakes. In late summer hypolimnetic water in humic Lake Lacawac, we observed 3 to 4.5 enrichments in  <sup>13</sup>C and a 30% increase in aromatic C relative to early spring values during spring mixing. These changes coincided with increases in molecular weight and UV absorbance. Anaerobic conditions of the hypolimnion in Lake Lacawac suggest that microbial metabolism may be turning over allochthonous C introduced during spring mixing, as well as autochthonous C. This metabolic activity produces HMW DOM during the summer, which is photochemically labile and isotopically distinct from allochthonous DOM or autochthonous DOM. These results suggest both photooxidation of allochthonous DOM in the epilimnion and autotrophic production of DOM by bacteria in the hypolimnion cause seasonal trends in the UV absorbance of lakes. 
24715142|Internal waves (seiches) are well-studied physical processes in stratified lakes, but their effects on sediment porewater chemistry and microbiology are still largely unexplored. Due to pycnocline oscillations, sediments are exposed to recurrent changes between epilimnetic and hypolimnetic water. This results in strong differences of environmental conditions, which should be reflected in the responses of redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes at both, the sedimentwater interface and deeper sediment layers. We tested in a series of mesocosm experiments the influence of seiche-induced redox changes on porewater chemistry and bacterial activity in the sediments under well controlled conditions. Thereby, we excluded effects of changes in current and temperature regimes. For a period of 10 days, intact sediment cores from oligotrophic Lake Stechlin were incubated under constant (either oxic or anoxic) or alternating redox conditions. Solute concentrations were measured as porewater profiles in the sediment, while microbial activity was determined in the upper 0.5 cm of sediment. Oxic and alternating redox conditions resulted in similar ammonium, phosphate, and methane porewater concentrations, while concentrations of each analyte were considerably higher in anoxic cores. Microbial activity was clearly lower in the anoxic cores than in the oxic and the alternating cores. In conclusion, cores with intermittent anoxic phases of up to 24 hours do not differ in biogeochemistry and microbial activities from static oxic sediments. However, due to various physical processes seiches cause oxygen to penetrate deeper into sediment layers, which affects sediment redox gradients and increase microbial activity in seiche-influenced sediments.
1469390|Transformations and fluxes of N were examined in three forested sites located along a gradient of soil texture in the coastal forests of the Waquoit Bay watershed on Cape Cod. Total N leaching losses to ground water were 0.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the loamy sand site and 1.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the fine sand site. Leaching loss to groundwater was not measured in the coarse sand site due to the prohibitive depth of the water table but total N leaching loss to 1m depth in the mineral soil was 3.9 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. DON accounted for most of the leaching losses below the rooting zone (77-89%) and through the soil profile to ground water (60%-80%). Differences in DON retention capacity of the mineral soil in the sites along the soil texture gradient were most likely related to changes in mineral soil particle surface area and percolation rates associated with soil texture. Forests of the watershed functioned as a sink for inorganic N deposited on the surface of the watershed in wet and dry deposition but a source of dissolved organic N to ground water and adjoining coastal ecosystems.
41490411|Soil respiration, the flux of CO from the soil to the atmosphere represents a major flux in the global carbon cycle. Our ability to predict this flux remains limited because of multiple controlling mechanisms that interact over different temporal and spatial scales. However, new advances in measurement and analyses present an opportunity for the scientific community to improve the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate soil respiration. In this paper, we address several recent advancements in soil respiration research from experimental measurements and data analysis to new considerations for modeldata integration. We focus on the links between the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum at short (i.e., diel) and medium (i.e., seasonal-years) temporal scales. First, we bring attention to the importance of identifying sources of soil CO production and highlight the application of automated soil respiration measurements and isotope approaches. Second, we discuss the need of quality assurance and quality control for applications in time series analysis. Third, we review perspectives about emergent ideas for modeling development and model-data integration for soil respiration research. Finally, we call for stronger interactions between modelers and experimentalists as a way to improve our understanding of soil respiration and overall terrestrial carbon cycling.
24715131|A conceptual model of the main carbon and nitrogen flows through pelagic and benthic food webs was used to identify the key biogeochemical processes representing ecosystem functioning, and to select indicators of each of these processes. A combined fieldwork and modelling approach was used to provide the data required to evaluate the indicators in terms of their suitability for assessing and managing the impacts of climate change and demersal trawling. Four of our 16 proposed indicators (phytoplankton production and productivity, near-bed oxygen concentrations and oxygen penetration of the seabed) met the majority of criteria we used for evaluating indicators. Five indicators (depth of anoxic sediment, zoobenthos biomass, production, productivity and bioturbation potential) did not comply with sufficient criteria to be considered as good indicators. Six of our proposed indicators (zooplankton biomass, size structure, production and productivity; ecosystem productivity; ecosystem balance) could not be assessed for sensitivity and specificity using our models, and therefore need to be addressed in future work aimed at improving both the models and the fieldwork. Our results indicate that evaluation of indicators is difficult, because of the number and variety of human pressures which need to be considered in reality, and the interactions between these pressures and the ecosystem components which they affect. The challenge will be to establish if there are indeed any indicators which are able to meet the majority of criteria for good indicators in holistic ecosystem-based assessments.
20519807|Decomposition is central to understanding ecosystem carbon exchange and nutrient-release processes. Unlike mesic ecosystems, which have been extensively studied, xeric landscapes have received little attention; as a result, abiotic soil-respiration regulatory processes are poorly understood in xeric environments. To provide a more complete and quantitative understanding about how abiotic factors influence soil respiration in xeric ecosystems, we conducted soil-respiration and decomposition-cloth measurements in the cold desert of southeast Utah. Our study evaluated when and to what extent soil texture, moisture, temperature, organic carbon, and nitrogen influence soil respiration and examined whether the inverse-texture hypothesis applies to decomposition. Within our study site, the effect of texture on moisture, as described by the inverse texture hypothesis, was evident, but its effect on decomposition was not. Our results show temperature and moisture to be the dominant abiotic controls of soil respiration. Specifically, temporal offsets in temperature and moisture conditions appear to have a strong control on soil respiration, with the highest fluxes occurring in spring when temperature and moisture were favorable. These temporal offsets resulted in decomposition rates that were controlled by soil moisture and temperature thresholds. The highest fluxes of CO occurred when soil temperature was between 10 and 16 C and volumetric soil moisture was greater than 10%. Decomposition-cloth results, which integrate decomposition processes across several months, support the soil-respiration results and further illustrate the seasonal patterns of high respiration rates during spring and low rates during summer and fall. Results from this study suggest that the parameters used to predict soil respiration in mesic ecosystems likely do not apply in cold-desert environments.
1469169|We determined phosphate uptake by calcareous sediments at two locations within a shallow lagoon in Bermuda that varied in trophic status, with one site being mesotrophic and the other being more eutrophic. Phosphate adsorption over a six hour period was significantly faster in sediments from the mesotrophic site. Uptake at both sites was significantly less than that reported for a similar experiment on calcareous sediments in an oligotrophic lagoon in the Bahamas. The difference in phosphorus adsorption between our sites did not appear to be related to sediment characteristics often cited as important, such as differences in surface area (as inferred from grain size distributions), total organic matter content, or iron content. However, the sediment total phosphorus contents were inversely related to phosphorus uptake at our sites in Bermuda, and at the previously studied Bahamas site. We hypothesize that phosphate uptake in these calcareous sediments is a multi-step process, as previously described for fluvial sediments or pure calcium carbonate solids, with rapid initial surface chemisorption followed by a slower incorporation into the carbonate solid-phase matrix. Accordingly, sediments already richer in solid phase phosphorus take up additional phosphate more slowly since the slower incorporation of surface-adsorbed phosphate into the carbonate matrix limits the rate of renewal of surface-reactive adsorption sites. Although carbonate sediments are a sink for phosphate, and thereby reduce the availability of phosphorus for benthic macrophytes and phytoplankton in the shallow overlying water, phosphate uptake by these sediments appears to decrease along a gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic sites. If our result is general, it implies a positive feedback in phosphorus availability, with a proportionately greater percentage of phosphorus loading being biologically available longer as phosphorus loading increases. This pattern is supported by the significantly higher tissue phosphorus content of the seagrass, Thalassia testudinum, collected from the eutrophic inner bay site. Over time, this effect may tend to cause a shift from phosphorus to nitrogen limitation in some calcareous marine environments.
1468575|Spruce needles of different age, litter materials and soil samples from the L-, O- and A-horizons of a mor profile were analysed by temperature-programmed pyrolysis (Py) in combination with field ionization mass spectrometry (FIMS). The integrated Py-FI mass spectra give characteristic fingerprints of the biomaterials investigated. The application of principal component analysis to the mass spectral data results in a clear discrimination and classification of the samples reflecting the chemical modifications and transformations of organic matter by biochemical and biogeochemical processes. The chemical compositions are determined by processes such as enrichment and/or translocation of plant constituents (e.g. carbohydrates, lignin, lipids, suberin, and aliphatic polymers) during maturation and senescence of needles; amendment of new components; decomposition; selective preservation and humification processes in the soil environment. During needle maturation, major chemical changes include the decrease of carbohydrate content, condensation of lignin, and crosslinking of waxes. Senescent needles are characterized by lower contents of carbohydrates and lower yields of monomeric pyrolysis products from lignin. The contribution of different litter materials to the humus layer can be estimated by differences in chemical composition. During litter decomposition and humification on the forest floor, carbohydrate content decreases rapidly. The lignin content remains almost constant but some subunits are continuously oxidized. Wax material accumulates until the mechnical disintegration of the needle occurs. In the O-horizons polymeric aliphatic materials are enriched in humified plant remains. A constant increase of aryl-alkyl esters from suberin in the O-horizons is due to both root input and selective preservation. In general, mainly aliphatic polymers and aryl-alkyl esters accumulate during the genesis of mor profiles under conifers.
1468512|Variable-charge (v-c) and permanent-charge (p-c) soils differ fundamentally with regard to many nutrient-cycling processes. Variable-charge soils are more common in the tropics than in temperature zones because their formation requires desilication, which proceeds fastest in warm, moist climates. The dynamics of nutrient mobility tend to be more complex in v-c than in p-c soils. For example, theory predicts that, as pH of v-c soils decreases, cation exchange capacity (CEC) also decreases and anion exchange capacity (AEC) increases. If AEC exceeds CEC, cations such as ammonium and potassium will be more mobile than anions such as nitrate; this is the reverse of the situation in p-c soils, on which most of our knowledge of nutrient cycling is based. Variable-charge surfaces sorb phosphorus, creating plant nutritional problems throughout large areas of the humid tropics. Desilication, the same process that creates v-c surfaces, results also in stable aggregation, creating soils that retain water, yet drain rapidly and resist erosion. The Soil Taxonomy system incorporates information on mineralogy, texture, and organic matter content, and therefore provides insights into patterns of charge chemistry and nutrient cycling across a wide range of soil types.
1469650|The increasing atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O concentration and the imbalance in its global budget have triggered the interest in quantifying N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes from various ecosystems. This study was conducted to estimate the annual N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from a transitional grassland-forest region in Saskatchewan, Canada. The study region was stratified according to soil texture and land use types, and we selected seven landscapes (sites) to cover the range of soil texture and land use characteristics in the region. The study sites were, in turn, stratified into distinguishable spatial sampling units (i.e., footslope and shoulder complexes), which reflected the differences in soils and soil moisture regimes within a landscape. N<sub>2</sub>O emission was measured using a sealed chamber method. Our results showed that water-filled pore space (WFPS) was the variable most correlated to N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. With this finding, we estimated the total N<sub>2</sub>O emissions by using regression equations that relate WFPS to N<sub>2</sub>O emission, and linking these regression equations with a soil moisture model for predicting WFPS. The average annual fluxes from fertilized cropland, pasture/hay land, and forest areas were 2.00, 0.04, and 0.02 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The average annual fluxes for the medium- to fine-textured and sandy-textured areas were 1.40 and 0.04 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The weighted-average annual flux for the study region is 0.95 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The fertilized cropped areas covered only 47% of the regional area but contributed about 98% of the regional flux. We found that in the clay loam, cropped site, 2% and 3% of the applied fertilizer were emitted as N<sub>2</sub>O on the shoulders and footslopes, respectively.
20055269|The current expansion of Phragmites australis into the high marsh shortgrass (Spartina patens, Distichlis spicata) communities of eastern U.S. salt marshes provided an opportunity to identify the influence of vegetation types on pools and fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Two brackish tidal marshes of the National Estuarine Research Reserve system were examined, Piermont Marsh of the Hudson River NERR in New York and Hog Island in the Jacques Coustaeu NERR of New Jersey. Pools of DIN in porewater and rates of DIN surface flux were compared in replicated pairs of recently-expanded P. australis and neighboring S. patens-dominated patches on the high marsh surface. Both marshes generally imported nitrate (NO) and exported ammonium (NH), such that overall DIN was exported. No differences in surface exchange of NO or NH were observed between vegetation types. Depth-averaged porewater NH concentrations over the entire growing season were 56% lower under P. australis than under S. patens (average 1.4 vs. 3.2 mg NH
1469319|Sediment cores were collected from lakes in central and northern Canada and from Hudson Bay to compare current and historic net depositions of mercury. Cores from most locations were enriched in mercury in the upper layers deposited recently relative to deeper, historic layers. The lakes with the greatest enrichments in mercury were located in central/southern Canada. This enrichment was interpreted as being of anthropogenic origin. Mercury inputs at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in northwestern Ontario inferred from a core profile agreed well with inputs calculated independently from precipitation and runoff data. Anthropogenic inputs of mercury to northwestern Ontario were calculated to be about 9  g m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>. Considering all the locations over the geographic range, the core profiles infer that fluxes of mercury have increased on average by about 2 fold over the past half century. This is consistent with results from other sites in North America and Europe.
1469851|Water and suspended sediment (SS) samples were collected from the Changjiang River at the Datong Hydrological Station (DHS), five times from May 1997 through January 1999 in order to evaluate transport, composition and bioavailability of phosphorus (P) during a 1998 flood. Transport of most of the phosphorus compositions was substantially higher during the 1998 flood than at other sampling dates. Phosphorus associated with suspended sediment (TPP) accounted for more than 85% of total phosphorus (TP) transport during periods of preflood and flood. The high transport of TPP during the flood was due to unusually high concentrations of TPP and sediment discharge. The potentially bioavailable phosphorus in SS (PBAP) accounted for about 10% of TPP. PBAP with dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) consisted of 15-89% of TP. For all the sampling dates, the concentrations of potential bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) ranged from 0.035-0.08 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, significantly higher than the limiting concentration for eutrophication. Therefore, the increasing temporal trends of TP concentration and high bioavailability of TP appear to support more frequent algal blooms in receiving East China Sea coastal waters in recent years. Hence, the underestimate of TPP transport by large rivers may also underestimate the biogeochemical cycling of other associated nutrients, such as nitrogen and carbon.
1469943|Nitrogen (N) mineralization is a spatially variable and difficult component of the N cycle to quantify accurately under field conditions. Net N-mineralization was compared by direct measurement, indirect estimate, and laboratory incubation for a restored tallgrass prairie and for deficiently and optimally N-fertilized, no-tillage (NT) and chisel-plowed (CP) maize (Zea mays L.) agroecosystems on Plano silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudoll) in Wisconsin, USA. Four years of in-situ field measurements using an incubated-soil-core/ion-exchange-resin-bag technique showed that land use significantly affected net N-mineralization. Net N-mineralization was consistently smaller in the restored prairie than in the maize agroecosystems and typically larger in the CP than in the NT maize agroecosystems. Three independent methods for indirectly estimating annual net N-mineralization (i.e., N budget residual, deficiently N-fertilized plant N uptake, and profile-scaled in-situ field measurements) were relatively consistent at capturing land-use and tillage effects on net N-mineralization. Laboratory incubation and periodic leaching of Fall-sampled soils demonstrated that both mineralized N and labile C were co-limiting factors influencing N-mineralization in agricultural soils and generally supported field measurements by showing a significant difference in net N-mineralization with and without added fertilizer-N.
1468795|A seven year chemical budget of a minerotrophic conifer swamp located on the PreCambrian Shield, Ontario, Canada and subjected to anthropogenically acidified deposition is presented. Contrary to other published studies, this swamp retains sulphate during wet years and exports it during dry years. Alkalinity is always retained (acidity is exported) and base cations are almost always exported. It is predicted that if this pattern continues, the cation exchange sites of the swamp will become increasingly saturated with protons and aluminum ions, and the waters passing through the swamp will be increasingly acidified.
1468947|Solute concentrations in atmospheric deposition and stream water were measured from 1984 through 1993 to determine the fate and mobility of solutes in two gauged mixed-conifer catchments (Tharp's and Log creeks) located in the Sierra Nevada, California. The two catchments contain mature forest stands dominated by Abies concolor (white fir), Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia), Abies magnifica (red fir) and Pinus lambertiana (sugar pine). Ammonium, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were highest in concentration of the solutes measured in wet deposition; bulk deposition was highest in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>. Net retention of H<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> occurred in both catchments. Discharge was dominated by spring snowmelt with the largest export yields for acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), SiO<sub>2</sub>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Export yields of H<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> were relatively small (0.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>). Discharge-concentration relationships for ANC, SiO<sub>2</sub>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were inverse and their concentrations in stream water were primarily influenced by discharge and annual differences in the relative contributions of snowmelt and groundwater. The mobility of these solutes is controlled by the rates of mineral weathering and ion exchange. The positive relationship of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration with increasing discharge suggests that atmospherically deposited SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is temporarily stored and that its release is controlled by the extent of soil water flushing.
1469340|Many ideas have been advanced regarding how trees affect soils. Enough evidence is now available to evaluate the strength of these ideas and to consider interactions between tree species and soils in an evolutionary context. Forest floor mass commonly differs by about 20% for different species growing on the same site; differences of up to 5-fold have been reported. Litterfall mass and N content commonly differ by 20 to 30%, but larger differences are also common (especially with N-fixing species). The net mineralizaton of soil N typically differs by 50% or more among species, indicating very strong feedback possibilities. We evaluate the evolutionary context of tree effects on soils by considering 3 degrees of coupling of trees to soils: tightly woven connections where the fitness of the tree is enhanced by its effect on soils; loosely woven interactions where selection for tree fitness unrelated to soil properties leads to indirect effects on soils (either enhancing or impairing fitness); and frayed interactions where the effects of trees on soil derive from features of the ecosystem that do not involve direct selection for tree fitness. Evidence supports each of these degrees of interaction for at least some cases, and no single context explains all the interactions between trees and soils. Important areas for further work include: next-generation assessments of the effects of trees on soil suitability for the same (and different) species, and the role of soil organisms in developing and modifying the effects of trees on soils.
1469163| Few measurements of nitrogen fixation exist for streams. Desert streams are warm, well lighted, and often support abundant cyanobacterial populations; thus N<sub>2</sub> fixation may be significant in these N-poor ecosystems. N<sub>2</sub> fixation was measured in situ by acetylene reduction for two patch types (Anabaena mat and an epilithic assemblage). Patch-specific rates were high compared with published values (maximum 775 g N<sub>2</sub> [83 mol C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>] mg chl a<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> or 51 mg N<sub>2</sub> [5.4 mmol C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>] m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Daytime fixation was higher than nighttime fixation, and temperature, light and inorganic N concentration explained 52% of variance in hourly rates over all dates. Diel input-output budgets were constructed on five dates when cyanobacteria were present in the stream. Diel N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates were measured for comparison with reach-scale diel nitrogen retention, to assess the importance of this vector to N economy of the stream. Fixation accounted for up to 85% of net N flux to the benthos, but its importance varied seasonally. Finally, we applied biomass-specific fixation rates to 1992 and 1993 biomass data to obtain seasonal and annual N<sub>2</sub> fixation estimates. Cyanobacteria were absent or rare during winter and spring, thus most of the annual N<sub>2</sub> fixation occurred during summer and autumn. Annual rates of nitrogen fixation for 1992 and 1993 (8.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> and 12.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>) were very high compared to other streams, and moderately high compared to other ecosystems. Like other phenomena in this disturbance-prone ecosystem, nitrogen fixation is strongly influenced by the number and temporal distribution of flood events. 
1469134| Inorganic sulfur turnover was examined in oligohaline (salinity < 2 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) Chesapeake Bay sediments during the summer. Cores incubated for < 3 hr exhibited higher sulfate reduction (SR) rates (13-58 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) than those incubated for 3-8 hr (3-8 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). SR rates (determined with <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) increased with depth over the top few cm to a maximum at 5 cm, just beneath the boundary between brown and black sediment. SR rates decreased below 5 cm, probably due to sulfate limitation (sulfate < 25 M). Kinetic experiments yielded an apparent half-saturating sulfate concentration (K<sub>s</sub>) of 34 M,  20-fold lower than that determined for sediments from the mesohaline region of the estuary. Sulfate loss from water overlying intact cores, predicted on the basis of measured SR rates, was not observed over a 28-hr incubation period. Reduction of <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> during diffusion experiments with intact core segments from 0-4 and 5-9 cm horizons was less than predicted by non-steady state diagenetic models based on <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction in whole core injection experiments. The results indicate that net sulfate flux into sediments was an order of magnitude lower than the gross sulfur turnover rate. Solid phase reduced inorganic sulfur concentrations were only 2-3 times less than those in sediments from the mesohaline region of the Bay, despite the fact that oligohaline bottom water sulfate concentrations were 10-fold lower. Our results demonstrate the potential for rapid SR in low salinity estuarine sediments, which are inhabited by sulfate-reducing bacteria with a high affinity for sulfate, and in which sulfide oxidation processes replenish the pore water sulfate pool on a time scale of hours. 
1469740|The conversion of annually cultivated or disturbed marginal land to forage grasses has the potential to accrete soil organic carbon (SOC) in the surface 0-15 cm depth. Soil organic carbon mass (Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) was measured in ten side-by-side cultivated versus forage grass seed-down restoration treatments on catenae at various sites in east-central Saskatchewan, Canada. Treatments were imposed for time periods ranging from five to twelve years. It was found that SOC mass was usually significantly higher in the grassland restorations versus the paired cultivated equivalents. Estimated SOC gain rates (0-15 cm) from grass seed-down in the region was estimated to be 0.6 to 0.8 Mg C ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Light fraction organic carbon (LFOC), the labile component of SOC, was more variable in the comparisons than SOC. Measured <sup>13</sup>C natural abundance values in selected equivalent comparisons revealed a possible contribution from seeded warm season C<sub>4</sub> grasses and soil carbonate <sup>13</sup>C to the C pools in upslope positions of the landscape. Overall, grassland restoration in this region appears to result in increased carbon storage in the surface soil.
1468908|Methane emissions from rice paddies were quantified by using an automatic field system stationed in Zhejiang Province, one of the centres for rice cultivation in China. The data set showed pronounced interannual variations over 5 consecutive vegetation periods; by computing average values of all experimental plots the annual emissions were 177 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in 1987, 50 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in 1988, and 187 g CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in 1989. The field preparations encompassed 4 different treatments: (1) no fertilizers, (2) mineral fertilizer (KCl, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), (3) organic manure (rape seed cake, animal manure), (4) mineral fertilizer plus organic manure. The methane emission rates of the different fertilizer treatments did not show significant differences. The mean emission rates, calculated over the entire observation period of 5 seasons, were 30.4 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> (non-fertilized plot) and 28.3 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> (mineral fertilizers). These values indicate a high level of methane production even without additional input of organic material into the rice-soils. In the other plots, the organic fertilizers were added once per vegetation period at app. 1 t fresh weight per ha, a relatively low application rate by agronomical standards. The mean emission rates were 35.1 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> when manure was applied as sole fertilizer and 27.5 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> when applied jointly with potassium fertilizers. Based on the results of this study we estimate a range of 18-28 Tg CH<sub>4</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> as the total methane emission from Chinese rice fields. However, more field data from representative sites in China are needed to reduce the uncertainties in this estimate.
1469353|A survey of nitric oxide (NO) emission from Chihuahuan desert soils found mean NO fluxes <0.1 ng NO-N cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> during the dry season. These fluxes were at the lower end of the range reported for temperate grassland and woodland ecosystems. NO fluxes from wet or watered soils were higher (0.1-35 ng NO-N cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). Watering of black grama grassland soils produced an initial pulse of 12 ng cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> (12-h after 1-cm watering) with high fluxes sustained over 4 days with repeated watering. Initial pulses from shrubland soils were lower (maximum 5 ng cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>), and fluxes declined with repeated watering. Repeated watering of creosotebush soils depleted the soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> pool, and NO emissions were directly related to soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations at the end of the experiment. In watered and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-fertilized creosotebush soils, NO fluxes were positively related to potential net nitrification rates. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-fertilization boosted the initial NO pulse 15 times in the shrubland and 5 times in black grama grassland relative to watered controls. These experimental results point toward greater substrate limitation in shrublands. In this desert basin, NO emission averaged 0.12 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in untreated soil and 0.76 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in watered soil. We multiplied these averages by the distribution of grassland and shrubland vegetation within a 58,600-ha area of the Jornada del Muerto basin to estimate regional losses of 0.15-0.38 kg NO-N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> for this area of the Chihuahuan desert.
25652597|Soil carbon sequestration is a viable short-term option to mitigate increased atmospheric CO. In agriculture, strategies to increase the soil carbon (C) sink include no-tillage, cover crops, and improved crop rotation. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of tillage systems on SOC and total N, soil aggregation and aggregate associated C and N in three soil types: Oxisol (Brazil), Vertisol (Argentina), and Mollisol (USA). Long-term tillage experiments included tilled (T) and no-till (NT) systems. A native grassland was included for comparison in each site. Soil samples were taken at 05, 015, and 1530 cm depths. Water-stable aggregates (WSA) were separated using a wet-sieving method. Total C and total N were determined by dry combustion. A shift from native grassland to an agroecosystem decreased microbial biomass, but this decrease was less pronounced under NT. Cultivation reduced the mass of macroaggregates and the concentration associated C and N; however among agroecosystems, NT, regardless soil type, tended to be more similar to the native grassland sites. Agroecosystems reduced TOC and total N stocks, regardless of soil type, compared to the native grassland. This effect followed: Mollisol > Oxisol > Vertisol, and was more pronounced at the 05 cm soil depth than at deeper depths. This loss of C and N was associated with the decrease in the mass of macroaggregates and lower C and N concentrations of the aggregates. Macroaggregation was related to TOC and microbial biomass in the Mollisol, suggesting that the biological process of aggregate formation is the principal mechanism of C protection in these soils. The relationship between TOC and large macroaggregates showed lower values for the Oxisol and Vertisol, indicating that in these soils TOC has a complementary role in macroaggregation.
1469889|Atlantic tidal fluctuations drive pressure head variations in shallow offshore wells drilled into the limestone subsurface on both the Florida Bay and Atlantic sides of Key Largo, Florida, USA. We tested the hypothesis that these pressure head variations influence groundwater flow and that flux rate variability is associated with tidal variability. We used an automated Rn monitor to make continuous measurements of <sup>222</sup>Rn, a natural tracer of groundwater discharge, in Florida Bay waters. We also deployed three types of seepage meters, including an automated heat pulse meter to collect a continuous record of seepage from the sediments. Drum type seepage meters inserted into soft sediments and fiberglass meters cemented to the rocky bay floor were utilized with pre-filled 4-1 bag collectors, and monitored on an hourly basis. Maximum Rn inventories in Florida Bay waters were associated with high tide on the Atlantic side of the island. Modeling of the Rn variation indicated variable groundwater discharge rates with maximum flux occurring at high Atlantic tide. Seepage meter results in Florida Bay were consistent with <sup>222</sup>Rn modeling. Florida Bay seepage meter rates showed positive correlation with Atlantic tide, meter 1, r = 0.63, n = 12, p < 0.025 and meter 2, r = 0.67, n = 12, p < 0.025. A seepage meter offshore of the Atlantic side of Key Largo exhibited rates that were inversely correlated with Atlantic tide (r = 0.87, n = 9, p < 0.005) showing negative rates when the tide was high, and positive rates when the tide was low. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of Reich et al. (2002), that pressure head variations driven by Atlantic tide influence groundwater seepage rate variability in Florida Bay off Key Largo. Effectively, as proposed by Reich et al. (2002), Key Largo functions as a semi-permeable dam separating Florida Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.
20456525|Mechanisms of soil organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stabilization are of great interest, due to the potential for increased CO release from soil organic matter (SOM) to the atmosphere as a result of global warming, and because of the critical role of soil organic N in controlling plant productivity. Soil proteins are recognized increasingly as playing major roles in stabilization and destabilization of soil organic C and N. Two categories of proteins are proposed: detrital proteins that are released upon cell death and functional proteins that are actively released into the soil to fulfill specific functions. The latter include microbial surface-active proteins (e.g., hydrophobins, chaplins, SC15, glomalin), many of which have structures that promote their persistence in the soil, and extracellular enzymes, responsible for many decomposition and nutrient cycling transformations. Here we review information on the nature of soil proteins, particularly those of microbial origin, and on the factors that control protein persistence and turnover in the soil. We discuss first the intrinsic properties of the protein molecule that affect its stability, next possible extrinsic stabilizing influences that arise as the proteins interact with other soil constituents, and lastly controls on accessibility of proteins at coarser spatial scales involving microbial cells, clay particles, and soil aggregates. We conclude that research at the interface between soil science and microbial physiology will yield rapid advances in our understanding of soil proteins. We suggest as research priorities determining the relative abundance and turnover time (age) of microbial versus plant proteins and of functional microbial proteins, including surface-active compounds.
1469291|This study addresses the temporal distribution of forms of phosphorus in the soil of a temporarily flooded riparian forest of the valley of the river Garonne (Southwest of France). A sequential extraction for forms of phosphorus of increasing chemical stability was used. During the study period (13 months), the forest was flooded a few days during March and May. In winter, resin-Pi concentration was high (26  g g<sup>-1</sup>) in comparison to spring values (<latex>$<9\ \mu \text{g g}^{-1}$</latex>). NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-Po, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-Pi or NaOH-Pi concentrations increased during winter (up to 74, 124 and 78  g g<sup>-1</sup> respectively) and decreased significantly during spring (32, 44 and 32  g g<sup>-1</sup> respectively). This pattern was attributed to simultaneous mineralization and plant uptake during the growing season and to the flood events (erosional processes and P-release). During summer and fall, resin-Pi concentration increased significantly (up to 26  g g<sup>-1</sup> in October). NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-Po concentrations remained low during spring and summer (<latex>$<33\ \mu \text{g g}^{-1}$</latex>), and increased significantly in fall (<latex>$>45\ \mu \text{g g}^{-1}$</latex>). NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-Pi or NaOH-Pi increased in late spring or summer (90  g g<sup>-1</sup> and 68  g g<sup>-1</sup> respectively). Increasing concentrations of the labile forms during late spring or summer were ascribed to the warm temperature and soil dryness that limited plant growth. HCl-Pi increased regularly after the floods (174  g g<sup>-1</sup> before the flood events to 254  g g<sup>-1</sup> after the floods). Residual P presented a similar pattern i.e. 214  g g<sup>-1</sup> and 279  g g<sup>-1</sup> respectively before and after the flood events. This pattern was attributed to a progressive incorporation of flood deposits to the soil.
40647950|We examined the effect of concentration on nitrogen uptake patterns for a suburban stream in Maryland and addressed the question: How does NO uptake change as a function of concentration and how do uptake patterns compare with those found for NH? We applied a longitudinal (stream channel corridor) approach in a forested stream section and conducted short-term nutrient addition experiments in late summer 2004. In the downstream direction, NO concentrations decreased because of residential development in headwaters and downstream dilution; NH concentrations slightly increased. The uptake patterns for NO were very different from NH. While NH had a typical negative relationship between first-order uptake rate constant (K c ) and stream size, NO had a reverse pattern. We found differences for other metrics, including uptake velocity (V f ) and areal uptake rate (U). We attributed these differences to a stream size effect, a concentration effect and a biological uptake capacity effect. For NO these combined effects produced a downstream increase in K c , V f and U; for NH they produced a downstream decrease in K c and V f , and a not well defined pattern for U. We attributed a downstream increase in NO uptake capacity to an increase in hyporheic exchange and a likely increase in carbon availability. We also found that K c and V f were indirectly related with concentration. Similar evidence of ' nutrient saturation' has been reported in other recent studies. Our results suggest that higher-order uptake models might be warranted when scaling NO uptake across watersheds that are subject to increased nitrogen loading.
24715357|Post-fire coarse woody debris can represent a valuable nutrient reservoir for a regenerating ecosystem, helping to prevent soil fertility losses after a wildfire. However, there is scarce information on its effect on soil nutrient cycling and availability. We established three study sites along an altitudinal gradient in a burnt pine forest (SE Spain). At each site we determined: (1) decomposition rates and nutrient dynamics in charred logs left on the ground, 2 and 4 years after the fire, and (2) available nutrients in the soil and in the microbial fraction below charred logs and in bare soil areas. Despite the relatively slow decay rates in this Mediterranean climate (ca. 10 % of dry weight lost after 4 years), N and P were progressively released by logs, accounting for ca. 40 and 65 % of the initial content respectively after 4 years. This implies that the total aboveground biomass of the burnt forest released around 20 kg ha of N and 2 kg ha of P during this period. The presence of post fire coarse woody debris consistently increased soil organic matter by around 18 %, total C and N by 42 and 26 %, respectively, dissolved organic C and N by 47 %, available inorganic P by 68 %, and microbial biomass and nitrogen by some 36 and 48 %, respectively. By contrast, soil bulk density decreased by ca. 18 % under logs compared to bare areas. Thus, the fire-killed wood was useful in the recovery of soil fertility and nutrient availability. Leaving the post-fire woody debris on site can enhance the biogeochemical sustainability, microbiological processes and soil ecological functioning. The detrimental effect of post-fire salvage logging on soil fertility should be therefore considered when making management decisions.
20456583|Although agricultural systems in tropical monsoon Asia play a central role in the global nitrogen (N) cycle, details of the N cycle in this region on a watershed scale remain unclear. This study quantified the N budget in a tropical watershed of 221 km on Java Island, where paddy fields cover 28% of the land, by conducting field surveys.

20456426|An 1800-km South to North transect (N 5343 to 6943) through Western Siberia was established to study the interaction of nitrogen and carbon cycles. The transect comprised all major vegetation zones from steppe, through taiga to tundra and corresponded to a natural temperature gradient of 9.5C mean annual temperature (MAT). In order to elucidate changes in the control of C and N cycling along this transect, we analyzed physical and chemical properties of soils and microbial structure and activity in the organic and in the mineral horizons, respectively. The impact of vegetation and climate exerted major controls on soil C and N pools (e.g., soil organic matter, total C and dissolved inorganic nitrogen) and process rates (gross N mineralization and heterotrophic respiration) in the organic horizons. In the mineral horizons, however, the impact of climate and vegetation was less pronounced. Gross N mineralization rates decreased in the organic horizons from south to north, while remaining nearly constant in the mineral horizons. Especially, in the northern taiga and southern tundra gross nitrogen mineralization rates were higher in the mineral compared to organic horizons, pointing to strong N limitation in these biomes. Heterotrophic respiration rates did not exhibit a clear trend along the transect, but were generally higher in the organic horizon compared to mineral horizons. Therefore, C and N mineralization were spatially decoupled at the northern taiga and tundra. The climate change implications of these findings (specifically for the Arctic) are discussed.
40800615|Dissolved organic matter (DOM), produced through leaching from particulate organic matter (POM), is an essential component of the carbon cycle in streams. The present study investigated the instream DOM release from POM, varying in size and chemical quality. We produced large and medium sized fine particulate organic matter (L-FPOM, 250500 m; M-FPOM, 100250 m) of defined quality by feeding five types of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) to shredding amphipods (Gammarus spp.). Microscopic observations showed that L-FPOM and M-FPOM mainly consisted of the fecal pellets of amphipods, and incompletely eaten plant fragments, respectively. DOM release experiments were conducted by exposing CPOM and M-and L-FPOM fractions in natural stream water over a two week period. For CPOM, the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by leaching was highest during the first 6 h (3.64-23.9 mg C g C h) and decreased rapidly afterwards. For M-and L-FPOM, the DOC release remained low during the entire study period (range: 0.0080.15 mg C g C h). Two-way ANO VA revealed that the DOC release rate significantly differed with POM source and size fraction, both at day 1 and after a week of exposure. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant correlation of elemental contents and lignin content to DOC release rate after a week of exposure. Overall, the results indicated that DOC release rate of FPOM, on a carbon basis, is comparable to that of CPOM after leaching, while size and source of POM significantly affect DOC release rate.
20456507|The role of nitrogen (N) fixation in balancing N supply to wetland metaphyton was assessed by comparing primary production with enzymatic, isotopic, and elemental correlates. Primary production, N fixation (acetylene reduction, AR), phosphatase activity, C:N:P ratio, and N isotopic composition of metaphyton were measured along a nutrient gradient in a freshwater marsh during May through September 2004. N fixation and phosphatase activity in metaphyton were negatively correlated with inorganic N and P concentrations, respectively. Although metaphyton N fixation demonstrated a clear spatial pattern along the nutrient gradient, N fixation rates varied monthly and decreased sharply in September. However, the percent contribution of N fixation to N uptake by metaphyton consistently decreased throughout the summer. Furthermore, the decreased contribution of N fixation to N uptake corresponded with an increase in metaphyton N content during the growing season. Nitrogen isotopic data suggested the sustained importance of an atmospheric N source through September at the most downstream (nutrient poor) site even though the percent contribution of N fixition to N uptake was lowest in that month. This suggests that metaphyton were efficiently accumulating and recycling fixed N in support of primary production. Over the course of the summer, metaphyton primary production showed a weak inverse correlation with metaphyton phosphatase activity (r = 0.58). The largest residuals in this regression corresponded to the largest variation in metaphyton N content. When metaphyton primary production was normalized to metaphyton N content, production rates for the entire growing season were more strongly inversely correlated with metaphyton phosphatase activity (r = 0.78). Results of the study suggest that N fixation in N poor areas may adequately supplement community N requirements in metaphyton, thereby causing limitation by other elemental resources such as P.
1468725|The sources of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) to an alpine (Sky Pond) and a subalpine lake (The Loch) in Rocky Mountain National Park were explored for four years. The importance of both autochthonous and allochthonous sources of organic matter differ, not only between alpine and subalpine locations, but also seasonally. Overall, autochthonous sources dominate the organic carbon of the alpine lake, while allochthonous sources are a more significant source of organic carbon to the subalpine lake. In the alpine lake, Sky Pond, POC makes up greater than one third of the total organic matter content of the water column, and is related to phytoplankton abundance. Dissolved organic carbon is a product of within-lake activity in Sky Pond except during spring snowmelt and early summer (May-July), when stable carbon isotope ratios suggest a terrestrial source. In the subalpine lake, The Loch, DOC is a much more important constituent of water column organic material than POC, comprising greater than 90% of the spring snowmelt organic matter, and greater than 75% of the organic matter over the rest of the year. Stable carbon isotope ratios and a very strong relation of DOC with soluble Al<sub>(tot)</sub> indicate DOC concentrations are almost entirely related to flushing of soil water from the surrounding watershed during spring snowmelt. Stable carbon isotope ratios indicate that, for both lakes, phytoplankton is an important source of DOC in the winter, while terrestrial material of plant or microbial origin contributes DOC during snowmelt and summer.
41490443|Most of eastern North America receives elevated levels of atmospheric deposition of sulfur (S) that result from anthropogenic SO emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Atmospheric S deposition has acidified sensitive terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in this region; however, deposition has been declining since the 1970s, resulting in some recovery in previously acidified aquatic ecosystems. Accurate watershed S mass balances help to evaluate the extent to which atmospheric S deposition is retained within ecosystems, and whether internal cycling sources and biogeochemical processes may be affecting the rate of recovery from decreasing S atmospheric loads. This study evaluated S mass balances for 15 sites with watersheds in southeastern Canada and northeastern US for the period 1985 to 2002. These 15 sites included nine in Canada (Turkey Lakes, ON; Harp Lake, ON; Plastic Lake, ON; Hermine, QC; Lake Laflamme, QC; Lake Clair, QC; Lake Tirasse, QC; Mersey, NS; Moosepit, NS) and six in the US (Arbutus Lake, NY; Biscuit Brook, NY; Sleepers River, VT; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH; Cone Pond, NH; Bear Brook Watershed, ME). Annual S wet deposition inputs were derived from measured bulk or wet-only deposition and stream export was obtained by combining drainage water fluxes with SO concentrations. Dry deposition has the greatest uncertainty of any of the mass flux calculations necessary to develop accurate watershed balances, and here we developed a new method to calculate this quantity. We utilized historical information from both the US National Emissions Inventory and the US (CASTNET) and the Canadian (CAPMoN) dry deposition networks to develop a formulation that predicted SO concentrations as a function of SO emissions, latitude and longitude. The SO concentrations were used to predict dry deposition using relationships between concentrations and deposition flux derived from the CASTNET or CAPMoN networks. For the year 2002, we compared the SO concentrations and deposition predictions with the predictions of two continental-scale air quality models, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and A Unified Regional Air-quality Modeling System (AURAMS) that utilize complete inventories of emissions and chemical budgets. The results of this comparison indicated that the predictive relationship provides an accurate representation of SO concentrations and S deposition for the region that is generally consistent with these models, and thus provides confidence that our approach could be used to develop accurate watershed S budgets for these 15 sites. Most watersheds showed large net losses of SO on an annual basis, and the watershed mass balances were grouped into five categories based on the relative value of mean annual net losses or net gains. The net annual fluxes of SO showed a strong relationship with hydrology; the largest net annual negative fluxes were associated with years of greatest precipitation amount and highest discharge. The important role of catchment hydrology on S budgets suggests implications for future predicted climate change as it affects patterns of precipitation and drought. The sensitivity of S budgets is likely to be greatest in watersheds with the greatest wetland area, which are particularly sensitive to drying and wetting cycles. A small number of the watersheds in this analysis were shown to have substantial S sources from mineral weathering, but most showed evidence of an internal source of SO, which is likely from the mineralization of organic S stored from decades of increased S deposition. Mobilization of this internal S appears to contribute about 1-6 kg S ha year to stream fluxes at these sites and is affecting the rate and extent of recovery from acidification as S deposition rates have declined in recent years. This internal S source should be considered when developing critical deposition loads that will promote ecosystem recovery from acidification and the depletion of nutrient cations in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada.
1468714|The extent to which sediments of aquatic systems immobilize or release phosphorus can affect dramatically the P content of overlying waters. Data from 48 different aquatic systems suggests that there may be a major difference between fresh- and salt-water systems in this immobilization. Under oxic conditions (water overlying sediments had dissolved oxygen > 0.5 mg/L) P is strongly immobilized in sediments of most fresh-water systems. In sediments of most salt-water systems P is released from sediments and behaves, essentially, as a conservative tracer of benthic decomposition. This difference in P cycling is large enough to have an influence on the often cited difference in phytoplankton nutrient limitation between fresh- and salt-water systems.
20456447|The deposition of nitrogen (N) is high in subtropical forest in South China and it is expected to increase further in the coming decades. To assess effects of increasing deposition on N cycling, we investigated the current N status of two selected 40-45-year-old masson pine-dominated Chinese subtropical forest stands at Tieshanping (TSP, near Chongqing City) and Caijiatang (CJT in Shaoshan, Hunan province), and explored the applicability of several indicators for N status and leaching, suggested for temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Current atmospheric N deposition to the systems is from 25 to 49 kg ha year. The concentration of total N in the upper 15 cm of the soil is from as low as 0.05% in the B horizon to as high as 0.53% in the O/A horizon. The concentration of organic carbon (C) varies from 0.74 (B) to 9.54% (O/A). Pools of N in the upper 15 cm of the soils range from 1460 to 2290 kg N ha, where 25-55% of the N pool is in the O/A horizon (upper 3 cm of the soil). Due to a lack of a well-developed continuous O horizon (forest floor), the C/N ratio of this layer cannot be used as an indicator for the N status, as is commonly done in temperate and boreal forests. The net N mineralization rate (mg N g C year) in individual horizons correlates significantly with the C/N ratio, which is from as high as 18.2 in the O/A horizon to as low as 11.2 in the B horizon. The NO emission flux from soil is significantly correlated with the KCl extractable
20456508|Total emissions of NO from drained organic forest soils in Sweden were estimated using an equation linking the C:N ratio of the soil to NO emissions. Information on soil C:N ratios was derived from a national database. It was estimated that the emissions from Histosols amount to 2,820 tonnes NO a. This is almost five times the value calculated for the same soils using the method suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: 580 tonnes NO a. The higher value in the present study can mainly be explained by improved accuracy of estimates of NO emissions from nutrient-rich soils, including former agricultural soils. In Sweden, in addition to 0.94 Mha of drained Histosols, there are 0.55 Mha of other types of drained organic soils. The annual emissions from these soils were estimated to amount to 1,890 tonnes of NO. The total emission value calculated for drained organic forest soils was thus 4,700 tonnes NO a, which, if added, would increase the current estimate of the Swedish anthropogenic NO source strength by 18%. Of these emissions, 88% occur from sites with C:N ratios lower than 25. The exponential relationship between C:N ratio and NO emissions, in combination with a scarcity of data, resulted in large confidence intervals around the estimates. However, by using the C:N ratio-based method, NO emission estimates can be calculated from a variable that is readily available in databases. Also, the recent findings that there are exceptionally large emissions of NO from the most nitrogen-rich drained organic forest soils are taken into account.
1468641|Soil architecture is the dominant control over microbially mediated decomposition processes in terrestrial ecosystems. Organic matter is physically protected in soil so that large amounts of well-decomposable compounds can be found in the vicinity of largely starving microbial populations. Among the mechanisms proposed to explain the phenomena of physical protection in soil are adsorption of organics on inorganic clay surfaces and entrapment of materials in aggregates or in places inaccessible to microbes. Indirect evidence for the existence of physical protection in soil is provided by the occurrence of a burst of microbial activity and related increased decomposition rates following disruption of soil structures, either by natural processes such as the remoistening of a dried soil or by human activities such as ploughing. In contrast, soil compaction has only little effect on the transformation of <sup>14</sup>C-glucose. Another mechanism of control by soil structure and texture on decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems is through their impact on microbial turnover processes. The microbial population is not only the main biological agent of decomposition in soil, it is also an important, albeit small, pool through which most of the organic matter in soil passes. Estimates on the relative importance of different mechanisms controlling decomposition in soil could be derived from results of combined tracer and modelling studies. However, suitable methodology to quantify the relation between soil structure and biological processes as a function of different types and conditions of soils is still lacking.
24715141|In northeastern Canada, at the ecotonal limit of the forest tundra and lichen woodland, a rise of the regional water table in the peatland systems was registered since Little Ice Age resulting in increasing pool compartment at the expense of terrestrial surfaces. We hypothesized that, with a mean water table closer to peat surface and higher pool density, these ecosystems would be great CH emitters. In summers 2009 and 2010, methane fluxes were measured in a patterned fen located in the northeastern portion of the La Grande river watershed to determine the contribution of the different microforms (lawns, hollows, hummocks, string, pools) to the annual CH budget. Mean seasonal CH fluxes from terrestrial microforms ranged between 12.9 and 49.4 mg m day in 2009 and 15.4 and 47.3 mg m day in 2010. Pool fluxes (which do not include ebullition fluxes) ranged between 102.6 and 197.6 mg CH m day in 2009 and 76.5 and 188.1 mg CH m day in 2010. Highest fluxes were measured in microforms with water table closer to peat surface but no significant relationship was observed between water table depth and CH fluxes. Spatially weighted CH budget demonstrates that, during the growing season, the studied peatland emitted 66  31 in 2009 and 55  26 mg CH m day in 2010, 79 % of which is accounted by pool fluxes. In a context where climate projections predict greater precipitations in northeastern Canada, these results indicate that this type of peatlands could contribute to modify the methane balance in the atmosphere.
1469117| <sup>13</sup>C natural abundance variations were measured in peat soil and vegetation from two contrasting boreal forest wetlands: an upland watershed basin and a permanently saturated lowland mire. Evidence of methane oxidation was shown in the permanently saturated wetland with  <sup>13</sup>C values as low as -97  in carbonate minerals found in floating peat mats. It is postulated that <sup>13</sup>C depleted CH<sub>4</sub> is oxidized in the mat and reacts with calcium ions to form calcite (identified through x-ray diffraction). Methane flux measurements during the summer of 1992 showed much lower fluxes in areas with floating peat mats relative to open water. Secondary carbonates in the basin peat have isotope compositions close to the  <sup>13</sup>C values of the peat organic carbon (-25 ), indicating their origin from fermentation and possibly from sulfate-reduction. In the upland basin peat deposits, the  <sup>13</sup>C<sub>PDB</sub> values of organic C were constant with depth, while the permanently saturated mire had localities of <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in deeper layers of the peat. The <sup>13</sup>C enrichment may reflect areas of intense CH<sub>4</sub> production in which <sup>13</sup>C enriched residual substrate is left behind during the production of highly <sup>13</sup>C depleted CH<sub>4</sub>. 
1469792|Metal coordinating properties of DOC (dissolved organic carbon), and hence its influence on heavy metal release and mineral weathering, depend on the composition and properties of DOC. Tree species produce litter with different chemical composition and degradability, and these differences might influence the composition and reactivity of DOC in soil solutions. Accordingly, analysis of composition and reactivity of DOC in soil solution samples collected by centrifugation from 16 forest soil O horizons from the four tree species beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), oak (Quercus robur L.), grand fir (Abies grandis Lindl.), and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) on two clayey and two sandy soils were carried out. The composition and properties of DOC were determined by capillary zone electrophoresis, acid-base titration, Cu ion titration, total elemental analysis, IR and UV spectroscopy, and metal release assays. Concentrations of DOC ranged from 20 to 163 mM with pH ranging from 4.6 to 7.3. Norway spruce produced the highest DOC concentration, and the lowest pH. Carbon in low-molecular-weight aliphatic carboxylic acids (LACA) accounted for less than 6% of DOC with formic and acetic acids as the most abundant LACAs. The DOC was cation exchanged and proton saturated to obtain comparable forms of DOC. Titratable carboxylic acid and phenolic groups were in the range 51 to 82 and 20 to 64 mmol mol<sup>-1</sup> C, respectively, with fewer phenolic groups in grand fir DOC as the only significant difference. Infrared spectra of freeze-dried DOC samples suggest low contents of aromatic C in the DOC especially from grand fir stands. Stability constants, log K of Cu-DOC complexes, determined by Cu ion titration of DOC samples with fitting of the data to a two-site binding model, were in the range 5.63 to 6.21 for the strong binding sites and 3.58 to 4.10 for the weak sites, but with no significant effects of tree species or site. Freeze-dried DOC samples were found to consist of 41 to 45% C, 38 to 49% O, 4.4 to 5.4% H and 1.2 to 2.0% N and C/N ratios in the range 26 to 42. Reactivity of DOC in terms of release rates of Cd, Cu and Fe cations from a soil sample (flow cell experiments) showed no significant differences among DOC samples from different tree species and soil types. Apparently, only minor differences occur in chemical composition and reactivity of equivalent concentrations of DOC in forest floor soil solutions irrespective of origin, i.e. four tree species and two soil types. Soil solution pH and the concentration of DOC produced by various tree species are the critical parameters when distinguishing among tree species in relation to heavy metal release and mineral weathering.
20456383|Natural environmental isotopes of nitrate, sulphate and inorganic carbon are discussed in conjunction with major ion chemistry of subglacial runoff from a High Arctic glacier, Midre Lovnbreen, Svalbard. The chemical composition of meltwaters is observed to switch in accordance with subglacial hydrological evolution and redox status. Changing rapidly from reducing to oxidizing conditions, subglacial waters also depict that N/N values show microbial denitrification is an active component of nutrient cycling beneath the glacier. O/O ratios of sulphate are used to elucidate mechanisms of biological and abiological sulphide oxidation. Concentrations of bicarbonate appear to be governed largely by the degree of rock: water contact encountered in the subglacial system, rather than the switch in redox status, although the potential for microbiological activity to influence ambient bicarbonate concentrations is recognised. Glaciers are therefore highlighted as cryospheric ecosystems supporting microbial life which directly impacts upon the release of solute through biogeochemically mediated processes.
24715341|Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) is a fundamental component of the aquatic carbon cycle and a key driver of the biogeochemical interactions between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The origin, properties and role of DOM are increasingly characterised in lakes, rivers and streams, but little is known about DOM characteristics in ephemeral washes, which are the most common water flows in Mediterranean landscapes. Here, we examine the patterns in the optical properties of DOM in ephemeral washes draining a small catchment in the island of Menorca, Western Mediterranean. We used concentration data (dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen) and several spectroscopic descriptors (SUVA, absorption coefficient at 440 nm, fluorescence index, and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices) to assess changes in DOM concentrations and quality at both seasonal and spatial scales. Two periods were clearly distinguished in the DOM properties: autumn and winterspring. In autumn, which includes the first flows of the hydrological year, DOM showed an aromatic character and was spatially homogenous over the catchment. In winterspring, DOM was smaller and recently produced, and a considerable spatial heterogeneity was observed in all descriptors. The variability in DOM concentrations and quality was driven by hydromorphology and by the landscape features of the catchment, but the influence of these drivers on DOM properties changed along the hydrological year. In autumn, hydromorphology was the main factor determining DOM properties, whereas in winter-spring the land uses in the watershed highly determined the observed differences in DOM quality between subcatchments.
1469070|In situ decomposition of senescent leaves of two abundant mangrove species (Rhizophora mucronata Lamarck and Ceriops tagal (Perr) C. B. Rob), enrichment of nitrogen and activity of dinitrogen fixing bacteria during decomposition were investigated during both rainy and dry seasons in a tropical coastal lagoon (Gazi, Kenya). Rates of leaf decomposition were higher for R. mucronata than for C. tagal and were highest, for both species, during rainy season. Rates of decomposition, expressed as percentage dry mass loss, over a decomposition period of 50 days was: C. tagal (rainy season), 69%; C. tagal (dry season), 27%; R. mucronata (rainy season), 98%; and R. mucronata (dry season), 48%. High rainfall and diurnal tidal inundation appear to enhance the leaf decomposition process. Maximum rates of nitrogen fixation were 380 nmol N<sub>2</sub> h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> dw for C. tagal (rainy season), 78 nmol N<sub>2</sub> h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> dw for C. tagal (dry season), 390 nmol N<sub>2</sub> h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> dw for R. mucronata (rainy season) and 189 nmol N<sub>2</sub> h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> dw for R. mucronata (dry season). Although N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates were highest during rainy season, total nitrogen immobilised in the leaves was highest during the dry season. Biological nitrogen fixation can account for between 13 to 21% of the maximum nitrogen immobilised in the decaying mangrove leaves. Nitrogen fixation, as a source of allochthonous nitrogen, sustains a nitrogen input to the mangrove ecosystem, which adds significantly to the nitrogen input through leaf litterfall.
1469330| Methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations and production rates were examined along with sulfur biogeochemistry in Everglades sediments in March, July and December, 1995, as part of a large, multi-investigator study, the Aquatic Cycling of Mercury in the Everglades (ACME) project. The sites examined constitute a trophic gradient, generated from agricultural runoff, across the Everglades Nutrient Removal (ENR) Area, which is a re-constructed wetland, and Water Conservation Areas (WCA) 2A, 2B and 3 in the northern Everglades. MeHg concentrations and %MeHg (MeHg as a percent of total Hg) were lowest in the more eutrophic areas and highest in the more pristine areas in the south. MeHg concentrations ranged from <latex>$<0.1\ \text{ng gdw}^{-1}$</latex> sediment in the ENR to 5 ng gdw<sup>-1</sup> in WCA3 sediments; and MeHg constituted <0.2% of total Hg (Hg<sub>T</sub>) in ENR, but up to about 2% in two sites in WCA2B and WCA3 Methylation rates in surficial sediments, estimated using tracer-level injections of <sup>203</sup>Hg(II) into intact sediment cores, ranged from 0 to 0.12 d<sup>-1</sup>, or about 1 to 10 ng g<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> when the per day values are multiplied by the ambient total Hg concentration. Methylation was generally maximal at or within centimeters of the sediment surface, and was never observed in water overlying cores. The spatial pattern of MeHg production generally matched that of MeHg concentration. The coincident distributions of MeHg and its production suggest that in situ production controls concentration, and that MeHg concentration can be used as an analog for MeHg production. In addition, the spatial pattern of MeHg in Everglades sediments matches that in biota, suggesting that MeHg bioaccumulation may be predominantly a function of the de novo methylation rate in surficial sediments. Sulfate concentrations in surficial pore waters (up to 400 m), microbial sulfate-reduction rates (up to 800 nm cc<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) and resultant pore water sulfide concentrations (up to 300 m) at the eutrophic northern sites were all high relative to most freshwater systems. All declined to the south, and sulfate concentrations in WCA2B and in central WCA3 resembled those in oligotrophic lakes (50-100 m). MeHg concentration and production were inversely related to sulfate reduction rate and pore water sulfide. Control of MeHg production in the northern Everglades appears to mimic that in an estuary, where sulfate concentrations are high and where sulfide produced by microbial sulfate reduction inhibits MeHg production. 
23359733|Controls on chemical weathering, such as bedrock geology, runoff, and temperature, are considered to be the primary drivers of Si transport from the continents to the oceans. However, recent work has highlighted terrestrial vegetation as an important control over Si cycling. Here we show that at the regional scale (Southern New England, USA), land use/land cover (LULC) is an important variable controlling the net transport of Si from the land to the sea, accounting for at least 40% of dissolved Si (DSi) fluxes. A multiple linear regression model using average DSi fluxes from 25 rivers (>2,300 observations) shows the percent forest cover, as well as development and agricultural land use, to be significant (p < 0.05) drivers of DSi flux. This was true regardless of watershed size and lithology. Furthermore, forest cover is significantly negatively correlated, while development is significantly positively correlated, with Si concentrations and fluxes. We hypothesize that these relationships are due to several mechanisms, specifically the ability of terrestrial vegetation to store large amounts of Si within its biomass, the altered watershed hydrology that accompanies LULC change, and the capability of urban regions to serve as sources of Si to aquatic systems. Thus, we conclude that anthropogenic activities may be directly perturbing the global Si cycle through land use change and we offer a conceptual model which highlights a new approach to understanding the non-geochemical controls on Si fluxes.
1468828| The cycling and volatile loss of N derived from cattle urine at upland and lowland sites within the shortgrass steppe of eastern Colorado was studied, using <sup>15</sup>N-labelled urea as an N source. Losses of NH<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> were determined by direct measurement and by difference. Losses were higher from coarse (27% summer, 12% winter) than from fine textured (0-2%) soils. Immobilization and plant uptake of N accounted for significant amounts of added N. Extrapolating our plot measurements to a typical pasture, using spatially and temporally stratified urine deposition data, losses from upland sites were calculated to be 0.016 g N  m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, while losses from lowland sites were negligible. This resulted in an average loss of 0.011 g N  m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> for a pasture divided 70: 30 between uplands and lowlands. The loss of urine N calculated assuming no spatial stratification would be sevenfold higher (0.076 g N  m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>). Losses of NH<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> from urine, animal biomass removal, and N<sub>2</sub>O loss totaled only 0.07 g N  m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, or about 25% of wet deposition input. We calculated a potential loss of NH<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup> from senescing vegetation of 0.26 g N  m<sup>-2</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>, an order of magnitude larger than all other losses combined. 
1469678| We investigated the effect of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on hypolimnetic metabolism (accumulation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)) in 21 lakes across a gradient of DOC concentrations (308 to 1540 mol C L<sup>-1</sup>). The highly colored nature of the DOC in these lakes suggests it is mostly of terrestrial origin. Hypolimnetic methane accumulation was positively correlated with epilimnetic DOC concentration (Spearman rank correlation = 0.67; p < 0.01), an indicator of allochthonous DOC inputs, but not with photic zone chlorophyll a concentration (Spearman rank correlation = 0.30; p = 0.22). Hypolimnetic DOC concentrations declined in 19 of 21 lakes during the stratified period at rates that ranged from 0.06 to 53.9 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. The hypolimnetic accumulation of DIC+CH<sub>4</sub> was positively correlated with, and, in most cases of comparable magnitude to, this DOC decline suggesting that DOC was an important substrate for hypolimnetic metabolism. The percentage of surface irradiance reaching the thermocline was lower in high DOC lakes (0.3%) than in low DOC lakes (6%), reducing hypolimnetic photosynthesis (as measured by the depth and magnitude of the deep dissolved oxygen maxima) in the high DOC lakes. In June, the hypolimnia of lakes with <latex>$<400\ \mu \text{mol L}^{-1}$</latex> DOC had high concentrations of dissolved oxygen and no CH<sub>4</sub>, while the hypolimnia of lakes with DOC > 800  mol L<sup>-1</sup> were completely anoxic and often had high CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations. Thus, DOC affects hypolimnetic metabolism via multiple pathways: DOC was significant in supporting hypolimnetic metabolism; and at high concentrations depressed photosynthesis (and therefore oxygen production and DIC consumption) in the hypolimnion. 
1469064| We measured aboveground biomass and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), groundwater depth and fluctuation, and in situ nitrogen (N) mineralization in 13 upland and 4 wetland forest stands at Cedar Creek Natural History Area (CCNHA). The area, in east central Minnesota (4525 N, 9310 W), is on well-sorted glacial outwash of very uniform fine sand. Uplands are interspersed with peatlands and the area has shallow groundwater. Stands were aggregated into six ecosystem types based on overstory composition: oak, pine-oak, mesic hardwoods, northern white-cedar, lowland hardwoods, and savanna. Aboveground overstory biomass ranged from 35 to 250 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, lowest in the savanna and highest in the pine-oak. The ANPP ranged from about 2 to 7.5 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>; also lowest in the savanna but highest in the white-cedar. Over all types, the annual aboveground uptake of N was poorly related to available N measured by in situ mineralization (r<sup>2</sup>=0.01), but the relationship was better (r<sup>2</sup>=0.88) if N availability in the wetland stands was assumed to be a fixed proportion of N in the surface soil (1.5%). Over all types, in situ N mineralization was poorly related to ANPP (r<sup>2</sup>=0.05) and biomass (r<sup>2</sup>=0.38). Both ANPP and overstory biomass were more closely related to groundwater fluctuation (r<sup>2</sup>=0.87 and 0.28, respectively) than to depth (r<sup>2</sup>=0.01 and 0.21, respectively)). The strength of all relationships varied with the inclusion or exclusion of data from the wetland types or the savanna. Total soil N and rates of mineralization were inversely related (r<sup>2</sup>=0.42) because of data from wetland stands. Results demonstrate that the positive relationships between aboveground productivity and measured in situ N mineralization observed in upland forests are not valid for the landscape that includes wetland forests either because in situ measurements do not indicate N availability in wetlands or because of the presence of other limiting factors. The north temperate landscape includes an abundance of wetland forests with potentially strong linkages to uplands. This study suggests that the commonly-used measure of N availability provides inconsistent information about controls on ecosystems processes in this diverse landscape. 
40343590|The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of fertiliser N on C stocks in trees (stems, stumps, branches, needles, and coarse roots) and soils (organic layer +010 cm mineral soil) by analysing data from 15 long-term (1430 years) experiments in Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris stands in Sweden and Finland. Low application rates (3050 kg N ha year) were always more efficient per unit of N than high application rates (50200 kg N ha year). Addition of a cumulative amount of N of 6001800 kg N ha resulted in a mean increase in tree and soil C stock of 25 and 11 kg (C sequestered) kg (N added) ("N-use efficiency"), respectively. The corresponding estimates for NPK addition were 38 and 11 kg (C) kg (N). N-use efficiency for C sequestration in trees strongly depended on soil N status and increased from close to zero at C/N 25 in the humus layer up to 40 kg (C) kg (N) at C/N 35 and decreased again to about 20 kg (C) kg (N) at C/N 50 when N only was added. In contrast, addition of NPK resulted in high (4050 kg (C) kg (N)) N-use efficiency also at Nrich (C/N 25) sites. The great difference in N-use efficiency between addition of NPK and N at Nrich sites reflects a limitation of P and K for tree growth at these sites. N-use efficiency for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration was, on average, 34 times lower than for tree C sequestration. However, SOC sequestration was about twice as high at P. abies as at P. sylvestris sites and averaged 13 and 7 kg (C) kg (N), respectively. The strong relation between N-use efficiency and humus C/N ratio was used to evaluate the impact of N deposition on C sequestration. The data imply that the 10 kg N ha year higher deposition in southern Sweden than in northern Sweden for a whole century should have resulted in 2.0  1.0 (95% confidence interval) kg m more tree C and 1.3  0.5 kg m more SOC at P. abies sites in the south than in the north for a 100-year period. These estimates are consistent with differences between south and north in tree C and SOC found by other studies, and 7080% of the difference in SOC can be explained by different N deposition.
41490414|We estimated net anthropogenic phosphorus inputs (NAPI) to 18 Lake Michigan (LM) and 6 Lake Erie (LE) watersheds for 1974, 1978, 1982, 1987, and 1992. NAPI quantifies all anthropogenic inputs of P (fertilizer use, atmospheric deposition, and detergents) as well as trade of P in food and feed, which can be a net input or output. Fertilizer was the dominant input overall, varying by three orders of magnitude among the 24 watersheds, but detergent was the largest input in the most urbanized watershed. NAPI increased in relation to area of disturbed land (R = 0.90) and decreased with forested and wetland area (R = 0.90). Export of P by rivers varied with NAPI, especially for the 18 watersheds of LM (R = 0.93), whereas the relationship was more variable among the six LE watersheds (R = 0.59). On average, rivers of the LE watersheds exported about 10% of NAPI, whereas LM watersheds exported 5% of estimated NAPI. A comparison of our results with others as well as nitrogen (N) budgets suggests that fractional export of P may vary regionally, as has been reported for N, and the proportion of  inputs exported by rivers appears lower than comparable findings with N.
1469262|Soil solution chemistry was investigated at a forested watershed draining into Woods Lake, N.Y. as part of the Experimental Watershed Liming Study (EWLS). The objective of this study was to assess the response of soil water to watershed treatment of calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). This material was applied in an effort to mitigate the effects of acidic atmospheric deposition. Soil solutions draining Oa and Bs horizons in reference subcatchments were characterized by low pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) due to elevated concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and organic anions relative to the sum of base cation (C<sub>B</sub>: Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>) concentrations. Seasonal and spatial variation of pH and ANC in soil solutions appeared to be largely controlled by variations in the concentrations of dissolved organic acids which, in turn, were regulated by reactions of Al with soil organic matter. Nitrate was positively correlated and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was negatively correlated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Al concentrations in reference soil solutions, indicating that changes in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> influences spatial and seasonal variations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Al concentrations. On this basis, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> appears to be important in soil acidification and the dynamics of drainage water acidity. Comparison of our results with historical data for the site showed declines in concentrations of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, which are consistent with decreases in emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> in the eastern U.S. and atmospheric deposition of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> to the Adirondack region. Mineral soil solutions have shown large increases in concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Declines in concentrations of C<sub>B</sub> and increases in concentrations of Al have occurred over the last ten years, suggesting depletion of soil pools of exchangeable basic cations and increased sensitivity to acidic deposition. Calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) treatment of 6.89 Mg/ha resulted in a significant increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ANC and pH in both Oa and Bs horizon soil solutions. Soil water response to CaCO<sub>3</sub> addition was most evident during the first year after treatment, apparently due to macropore transport of particulate and dissolved CaCO<sub>3</sub>. However, increases in ANC and pH in the mineral soil waters were not sustained and appeared insufficient to result in substantial improvement in surface water quality over the 43 month study period.
1469794|Soil solution chemistry, soil acidity and composition of adsorbed cations were determined in two soil profiles developed under a mixed spruce (Picea abies and Picea sitchensis) stand and in one soil profile developed under an oak (Quercus robur) stand. Soils under spruce were classified as Spodosols and soils under oak were classified as Inceptisols. All profiles were developed in the same parent material; a Saahlian sandy till containing less than 2% clay. In the mineral soil, the contribution from mineral surfaces to the total cation-exchange capacity (CEC<sub>t</sub>) was estimated to be less than 3%. Soil solution pH and the percent base saturation of CEC<sub>t</sub> [%BS = 100 (2Ca + 2Mg + Na + K) CEC<sub>t</sub><sup>-1</sup>] were substantially lower in the upper 35-40 cm of the two Spodosols, as compared to the Inceptisol. The total amount of soil adsorbed base cations (BC) did not differ among the three profiles on an area basis down to 1 m soil depth. Thus, soil acidification of CEC<sub>t</sub> due to net losses of BC could not explain differences in soil pH and %BS among the soil profiles. A weak acid analogue, taking the pH-effect of metal complexation into consideration, combined with soil solution ionic strength as a covariate, could describe both the pH variation by depth within soil profiles and pH differences between the Inceptisol and the two Spodosol profiles. Our results confirm and extend earlier findings from O and E horizons of Spodosols that the extent to which organic acid groups react with Al minerals to form Al-SOM complexes is a major pH-buffering process in acidic forest soils. We suggest that an increasing Al-saturation of SOM is the major reason for the widely observed pH increase by depth in acidic forest soils with a pH less than approximately 4.5. Our results strongly imply that changes in mass of SOM, the ionic strength in soil solution and the relative composition of soil adsorbed Al and H need to be considered when the causality behind changes in pH and base saturation is investigated.
20456454|Organic matter decomposition and soil CO efflux are both mediated by soil microorganisms, but the potential effects of temporal variations in microbial community composition are not considered in most analytical models of these two important processes. However, inconsistent relationships between rates of heterotrophic soil respiration and abiotic factors, including temperature and moisture, suggest that microbial community composition may be an important regulator of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and CO efflux. We performed a short-term (12-h) laboratory incubation experiment using tropical rain forest soil amended with either water (as a control) or dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from native plant litter, and analyzed the effects of the treatments on soil respiration and microbial community composition. The latter was determined by constructing clone libraries of small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rRNA) extracted from the soil at the end of the incubation experiment. In contrast to the subtle effects of adding water alone, additions of DOM caused a rapid and large increase in soil CO flux. DOM-stimulated CO fluxes also coincided with profound shifts in the abundance of certain members of the soil microbial community. Our results suggest that natural DOM inputs may drive high rates of soil respiration by stimulating an opportunistic subset of the soil bacterial community, particularly members of the Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes groups. Our experiment indicates that variations in microbial community composition may influence SOM decomposition and soil respiration rates, and emphasizes the need for in situ studies of how natural variations in microbial community composition regulate soil biogeochemical processes.
4151502| It is demanded currently in public discussions to rewet peatlands and re-establish their function as nutrient sinks. But due to high phosphorus (P) concentrations in the pore water of rewetted peatlands (40-420 M) it is hypothesized that they can act as a surplus P source for adjacent surface waters and consequently support the eutrophication of such waters. Our detailed investigations of processes at the redox interface in four fens with different geochemical character show the dependence of P retention from the chemistry of the pore water. The precipitation of Fe(III) oxyhydroxide led to high retention of phosphorus and other substances such as DOC and sulphate in the eutrophic fens. When molar Fe/P ratios were larger than about 3 the initially high P concentrations in the anaerobic pore water (20-210 M) decreased to concentrations below 1 M under aerobic conditions. Thus, after rewetting high pore water concentrations of P do not automatically result in an increased P load to adjacent surface waters compared to pre-rewetting conditions. An enhanced P export to adjacent surface waters from eutrophic fens can be expected when the Fe/P ratio is smaller than 3 in the anaerobic pore water. In our investigations of natural, oligotrophic to mesotrophic fens the precipitation of Fe(III) oxyhydroxide was inhibited by the formation of stable dissolved Fe ~ humic complexes. P retention in these fens was only related to the DOC concentrations at the redox interface, so that lower DOC concentrations concurred with higher P retention. The P equilibrium concentrations in an aerobic environment can be higher than that of eutrophic fens with Fe/P ratios larger than about 3 in the anaerobic pore water. 
1468719|Root production and turnover were studied using sequential core sampling and observations in permanent minirhizotrons in the field in three dry heathland stands dominated by the evergreen dwarfshrub Calluna vulgaris and the grasses Deschampsia flexuosa and Molinia caerulea, respectively. Root biomass production, estimated by core sampling, amounted to 160 (Calluna), 180 (Deschampsia) and 1380 (Molinia) g m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Root biomass turnover rate in Calluna (0.64 yr<sup>-1</sup>) was lower compared with the grasses (Deschampsia: 0.96 yr<sup>-1</sup>; Molinia 1.68 yr<sup>-1</sup>). Root length turnover rate was 0.75-0.77 yr<sup>-1</sup> (Deschampsia) and 1.17-1.49 yr<sup>-1</sup> (Molinia), respectively. No resorption of N and P from senescing roots was observed in either species. Input of organic N into the soil due to root turnover, estimated using the core sampling data, amounted to 1.8 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Calluna), 1.7 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Deschampsia) and 19.7 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (Molinia), respectively. The organic P input was 0.05, 0.07 and 0.55 g P m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Using the minirhizotron turnover estimates these values were 20-22% (Deschampsia) and 11-30% (Molinia) lower. When the biomass turnover data were used, it appeared that in the Molinia stand root turnover contributed 67% to total litter production, 87% to total litter nitrogen loss and 84% to total litter phosphorus loss. For Calluna and Deschampsia these percentages were about three and two times lower, respectively. This study shows that (1) Root turnover is a key factor in ecosystem C, N, and P cycling; and that (2) The relative importance of root turnover differs between species.

25652631|Short and long-lived radium isotopes (Ra, Ra, Ra, Ra) were used to quantify submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and its associated input of inorganic nitrogen (NO), phosphorus (PO) and silica (SiO) into the karstic Alcalfar Cove, a coastal region of Minorca Island (Western Mediterranean Sea). Cove water, seawater and groundwater (wells and karstic springs) samples were collected in May 2005 and February 2006 for radium isotopes and in November 2007 for dissolved inorganic nutrients. Salinity profiles in cove waters suggested that SGD is derived from shallow brackish springs that formed a buoyant surface fresh layer of only 0.3 m depth. A binary mixing model that considers the distribution of radium activities was used to determine the cove water composition. Results showed that cove waters contained 20% brackish groundwater; of which 6% was recirculated seawater and 14% corresponded to freshwater discharge. Using a radium-derived residence time of 2.4 days, a total SGD flux of 150,000 m year was calculated, consisting of 45,000 m year recirculated seawater and 105,000 m year fresh groundwater. Fresh SGD fluxes of NO, SiO and PO were estimated to be on the order of 18,000, 1,140 and 4 mol m day, respectively, and presumably sustain the high phytoplankton biomass observed in the cove during summer. The total amount of NO and SiO supplied by SGD was higher than the measured inventories in the cove, while the reverse was true for PO. These discrepancies are likely due to non-conservative biogeochemical processes that occur within the subterranean estuary and Alcalfar Cove waters.
40343572|Differential uptake and translocation of Ca and Sr in organisms have been reported, calling into question the use of Sr to track Ca cycling in the environment. We investigated the relationship between Ca/Sr ratios in soil extracts of various strengths (HO, NHC1, and NHEDTA) and seedlings of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) grown from natural regeneration on 37 sites. Our objectives were to determine if Ca/Sr ratios in soil extracts are correlated with those in sugar maple tissues, and what soil extradant best duplicate plant tissue Ca/Sr ratios. Leaves had higher Ca/Sr ratios than stems and the extractants did not produce equal Ca/Sr ratios: HO had the lowest Ca/Sr, and NHEDTA the highest. The relationships between soil extract Ca/Sr ratios and leaf and stem Ca/Sr ratios were significant and linear, but the slopes differed among extractants. The lowest slope (0.45) was observed for the water extract/leaves and the highest (2.15) for the NHEDTA extract/stem with discrimination factors ranging from 0.22 with NH 4 EDTA to 1.59 for water. Leaf extracts were more strongly correlated with soil Ca/Sr than stem extracts (R of 0.57-0.7 vs. R of 0.45-0.6, respectively). These findings support the use of Ca/Sr ratios in plants to track their source of soil Ca, but they highlight the need to calibrate the relationships for the plant tissue and soil extractant used.
1469718| We analysed the stable isotope composition of emitted N<sub>2</sub>O in a one-year field experiment (June 1998 to April 1999) in unfertilized controls, and after adding nitrogen by applying slurry or mineral N (calcium ammonium nitrate). Emitted N<sub>2</sub>O was analysed every 2-4 weeks, with additional daily sampling for 10 days after each fertilizer application. In supplementary soil incubations, the isotopic composition of N<sub>2</sub>O was measured under defined conditions, favouring either denitrification or nitrification. Soil incubated for 48 h under conditions favouring nitrification emitted very little N<sub>2</sub>O (0.024 mol g<sub>dw</sub><sup>-1</sup>) and still produced N<sub>2</sub>O from denitrification. Under denitrifying incubation conditions, much more N<sub>2</sub>O was formed (0.91 mol g<sub>dw</sub><sup>-1</sup> after 48 h). The isotope ratios of N<sub>2</sub>O emitted from denitrification stabilized at  <sup>15</sup>N = -40.8  5.7 and  <sup>18</sup>O = 2.7  6.3. In the field experiment, the N<sub>2</sub>O isotope data showed no clear seasonal trends or treatment effects. Annual means weighted by time and emission rate were  <sup>15</sup>N = -8.6 and  <sup>18</sup>O = 34.7 after slurry application,  <sup>15</sup>N = -4.6 and  <sup>18</sup>O = 24.0 after mineral fertilizer application and  <sup>15</sup>N = -6.4 and  <sup>18</sup>O = 35.6 in the control plots, respectively. So, in all treatments the emitted N<sub>2</sub>O was <sup>15</sup>N-depleted compared to ambient air N<sub>2</sub>O ( <sup>15</sup>N = 11.4  11.6,  <sup>18</sup>O = 36.9  10.7). Isotope analyses of the emitted N<sub>2</sub>O under field conditions per se allowed no unequivocal identification of the main N<sub>2</sub>O producing process. However, additional data on soil conditions and from laboratory experiments point to denitrification as the predominant N<sub>2</sub>O source. We concluded (1) that the isotope ratios of N<sub>2</sub>O emitted from the field soil were not only influenced by the source processes, but also by microbial reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub> and (2) that N<sub>2</sub>O emission rates had to exceed 3.4 mol N<sub>2</sub>O m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> to obtain reliable N<sub>2</sub>O isotope data. 
20456456|Coastal marshes represent an important transitional zone between uplands and estuaries. One important function of marshes is to assimilate nutrient inputs from uplands, thus providing a buffer for anthropogenic nutrient loads. We examined the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization on biogeochemical and microbial processes during the summer growing season in a Spartina patens (Aiton (Muhl.)) marsh in the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve on Prudence Island (RI). Quadruplicate 1 m plots were fertilized with N and P additions, N-only, P-only, or no additions. N-only addition significantly stimulated bacterial production and increased pore water <tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math> and <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> concentrations. Denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 8 mmol m day. Fertilization had no apparent effect on soil oxygen consumption or denitrification measured in the summer in intact cores due to high core-to-core variation. P fertilization led to increased pore water dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations and increased DIP release from soils. In contrast the control and N-only treatments had significant DIP uptake across the soil-water interface. The results suggest that in the summer fertilization has no apparent effect on denitrification rates, stimulates bacterial productivity, enhances pore water nutrient concentrations and alters some nutrient fluxes across the marsh surface.
40343746|As atmospheric CO concentrations continue to rise and impact plant communities, concomitant shifts in belowground microbial processes are likely, but poorly understood. We measured monthly porewater concentrations of sulfate, sulfide, methane (CH), dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved organic carbon over a 5-year period in a brackish marsh. Samples were collected using porewater wells (i. e., sippers) in a Schoenoplectus americanus-domi nated (C sedge) community, a Spartina patens dominated (C grass) community and a mixed (C and C) community within the marsh. Plant communities were exposed to ambient and elevated (ambient + 340 ppm) CO levels for 15 years prior to porewater sampling, and the treatments continued over the course of our sampling. Sulfate reduction was stimulated by elevated CO in the C -dominated community, but not in the C -dominated community. Elevated CO also resulted in higher porewater concentrations of CH and dissolved organic carbon in the C -dominated system, though inhibition of CH production by sulfate reduction appears to temper the porewater CH response. These patterns mirror the typical divergent responses of C and C plants to elevated CO seen in this ecosystem. Porewater concentrations of nitrogen (as ammonium) and phosphorus did not decrease despite increased plant biomass in the C -dominated community, suggesting nutrients do not strongly limit the sustained vegetation response to elevated CO. Overall, our data demonstrate that elevated CO drives changes in porewater chemistry and suggest that increased plant productivity likely stimulates microbial decomposition through increases in dissolved organic carbon availability.
20456516|Phosphate interacts with inorganic sediment particles through sorption reactions in streams. Collectively, this phosphorus (P) buffering mechanism can be an important determinant of soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations. If sorption reactions control SRP concentrations in a stream, then differences in sediment characteristics may cause spatial differences in SRP concentrations. This prediction was tested by examining sediment-buffering characteristics and spatial variation in SRP among reaches with distinct sediment composition (i.e., fine versus coarse particles) in two tributaries of Boulder Creek, a headwater stream in central Wisconsin. SRP concentrations were significantly lower and algal available P and P sorption capacity were significantly higher in the reach dominated by fine sediments. Although fine particles such as sand had the greatest P sorption capacity, no retention could be attributed to biotic processes, whereas over 50% of P retention in coarse particles such as gravel could be linked to biotic uptake. Equilibrium P concentration (EPC) assays from different sediment fractions also indicate that biotic uptake is relatively unimportant in sand particles (
1468936|We report here three years of field observations of methane uptake, averaging 1.2 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in montane meadow soils. Surface soil moisture influenced diffusion of substrate while in deeper soil, where methane oxidation was maximum, moisture influenced both diffusion and microbial activity. Microbial oxidation of methane was maximum at an intermediate level of soil moisture, at this site at about 25% moisture by weight (50% water holding capacity). Laboratory incubations also showed inhibition below 20% moisture. These results provide in situ characterization of moisture limitation of methanotroph activity and evidence that soil drying may diminish the methane sink strength. The microbial limitation to methane consumption at low soil moisture provides a mechanism for positive feedback between methane flux and climate warming, as suggested by ice core data (Blunier et al. 1993; Chappellaz et al. 1990; Stauffer et al. 1985).
1469021|Extensive areas of the eastern United States are being exposed to elevated levels of nitrogen in precipitation, with levels of inorganic N in wet deposition ranging from 5 to over 20 times preindustrial, background levels. This increase in N loading to the terrestrial system, coupled with changes in land use in coastal regions in particular, has dramatically increased the level of nutrient loading from watersheds to the point that coastal waters are today among the most intensely fertilized ecosystems on earth. Studies in upland, aggrading forests have generally found that precipitation N inputs are efficiently sequestered in forest biomass and soil organic matter. However, acidic soils, sandy, porous parent substrates, and chronic inputs of salt spray common to coastal watersheds may all reduce the potential for N sequestration by the terrestrial community. We assessed the role of coastal forests in the long-term storage and retention of atmospherically-derived N in the watersheds of Waquoit Bay, MA, an increasingly eutrophic estuary on Cape Cod, by measuring precipitation inputs, storage, and lysimeter outputs below the rooting zone in a chronosequence of sites released from agriculture at different times. Calculated annual retention efficiencies were relatively low for an N-limited, aggrading forest (40-62%), and leaching losses did not vary with site age from young pine stands to mature beech forests. Nearly all nitrogen input was retained during summer months except in months with very high rainfall events. Nitrogen was released during the dormant-season in proportion to water flux through the forest floor. The composition of lysimeter output was 76% DON, 11% NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and 13% NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Total water flux and infiltration appear to be more important determinants of N retention in this sandy, coastal site than in more upland forest ecosystems; sandy systems may inherently have a low N retention efficiency.
40800598|Air temperature freeze-thaw cycles often occur during the early spring period directly after snowmelt and before budbreak in low arctic tundra. This early spring period may be associated with nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) loss from soils as leachate or as trace gases, due to the detrimental impact of soil freeze-thaw cycles and a developing active layer on soil microorganisms. We measured soil and microbial pools of C and  in early spring during a period of fluctuating air temperature (ranging from  4 to + 10 C) and in midsummer, in low arctic birch hummock tundra. In addition we measured NO, CH and CO production in the early spring. All of these biogeochemical variables were also measured in long-term snowfence (deepened snow) and N-addition plots to characterize climatechange related controls on these variables. Microbial and soil solution pools of C and N, and trace gas production varied among the five early spring sample dates, but only marginally and no more than among sample dates in midsummer. N-addition greatly elevated NO fluxes, indicating that although denitrifiers were present their activity during early spring was strongly limited by N-availability, but otherwise trace gas production was very low in early spring. The later thaw warmer winter and colder spring soil temperatures resulting from deepened snow did not significantly alter  pools or rates in early spring. Together, our results indicate strong stability in microbial and soil solution C and  pool sizes in the early spring period just after snowmelt when soil temperatures are close to 0 C (-1.5 to + 5C). A review of annual temperature records from this and other sites suggests that soil freeze-thaw cycles are probably infrequent in mesic tundra in early spring. We suggest that future studies concerned with temperature controls on soil and microbial biogeochemistry should focus not on soil freeze-thaw cycles per se, but on the rapid and often stepped increases in soil temperature that occur under the thawing snowpack.
41490481|Current conceptual models predict that changes in plant litter chemistry during decomposition are primarily regulated by both initial litter chemistry and the stageor extentof mass loss. Far less is known about how variations in decomposer community structure (e. g., resulting from different ecosystem management types) could influence litter chemistry during decomposition. Given the recent agricultural intensification occurring globally and the importance of litter chemistry in regulating soil organic matter storage, our objectives were to determine the potential effects of agricultural management on plant litter chemistry and decomposition rates, and to investigate possible links between ecosystem management, litter chemistry and decomposition, and decomposer community composition and activity. We measured decomposition rates, changes in litter chemistry, extracellular enzyme activity, microarthropod communities, and bacterial versus fungal relative abundance in replicated conventional-till, no-till, and old field agricultural sites for both corn and grass litter. After one growing season, litter decomposition under conventional-till was 20% greater than in old field communities. However, decomposition rates in no-till were not significantly different from those in old field or conventional-till sites. After decomposition, grass residue in both conventional-and no-till systems was enriched in total polysaccharides relative to initial litter, while grass litter decomposed in old fields was enriched in nitrogen-bearing compounds and lipids. These differences corresponded with differences in decomposer communities, which also exhibited strong responses to both litter and management type. Overall, our results indicate that agricultural intensification can increase litter decomposition rates, alter decomposer communities, and influence litter chemistry in ways that could have important and long-term effects on soil organic matter dynamics. We suggest that future efforts to more accurately predict soil carbon dynamics under different management regimes may need to explicitly consider how changes in litter chemistry during decomposition are influenced by the specific metabolic capabilities of the extant decomposer communities.
1469434|We measured CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes from three major plant communities characteristic of alpine tundra in the Colorado Front Range. Plant communities in this ecosystem are determined by soil moisture regimes induced by winter snowpack distribution. Spatial patterns of CH<sub>4</sub> flux during the snow-free season corresponded roughly with these plant communities. In Carex-dominated meadows, which receive the most moisture from snowmelt, net CH<sub>4</sub> production occurred. However, CH<sub>4</sub> production in one Carex site (seasonal mean = +8.45 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) was significantly larger than in the other Carex sites (seasonal means = -0.06 and +0.05 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). This high CH<sub>4</sub> flux may have resulted from shallower snowpack during the winter. In Acomastylis meadows, which have an intermediate moisture regime, CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation dominated (seasonal mean = -0.43 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). In the windswept Kobresia meadow plant community, which receive the least amount of moisture from snowmelt, only CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation was observed (seasonal mean = -0.77 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). Methane fluxes correlated with a different set of environmental factors within each plant community. In the Carex plant community, CH<sub>4</sub> emission was limited by soil temperature. In the Acomastylis meadows, CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rates correlated positively with soil temperature and negatively with soil moisture. In the Kobresia community, CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation was stimulated by precipitation. Thus, both snow-free season CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes and the controls on those CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes were related to the plant communities determined by winter snowpack.
41410554|Terrestrial sources of nitrogen (N), particularly N-fixing alder, may be important for sustaining production in headwater streams that typically lack substantial subsidies of marine-derived nutrients from spawning salmon yet support upstream-dispersing juvenile salmonids. However, other physiographic characteristics, such as watershed slope and topographic wetness, also control transport of nutrients to streams and may confound apparent linkages between alder and stream N. Seasonal patterns in precipitation and temperature may interact with watershed characteristics to modulate stream N availability. We empirically modeled the effect of alder cover and other watershed physiographic variables on stream N and contrasted these relationships over the growing season among 25 first-order streams from the lower Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. For each date, percent alder cover, mean topographic wetness, and mean slope were used as watershed predictors of NO-N concentration (nitrate + nitrite) and daily NO-N yield using Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and compared using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC c ). Alder cover was the only probable model and explained 75-96% of the variation in NO-N concentration and 83-89% of the variation in daily NO-N yield. The relationship between alder and both NO-N concentration and daily NO-N yield changed from constant inputs in May across the range of alder cover (linear fit) to increasing inputs in July and September (non-linear fits) implying that high-alder watersheds were Nsaturated. The strong linkage between alder and stream N coupled with the concurrent timing of maximum stream N from alder in the spring to salmon fry emergence indicates the potential importance of this subsidy to headwater stream ecosystems.
1468600|Sulfate and nitrate removal, and the resulting sulfuric and nitric acid neutralization within acid-sensitive lakes, were predicted from a simple model requiring knowledge only of water residence time, mean depth, and average mass transfer coefficients for nitrate and sulfate removal. The model applies to lakes with oxic hypolimnia which are typical of acid-sensitive lakes. Average mass transfer coefficients for sulfate and nitrate were obtained by two independent methods which agreed well with each other. A model such as this is necessary for predicting the rates at which different lakes acidify and recover from acidification, and explains why lakes with short water residence times are especially susceptible to acidification.
41490524|The number of studies focused on the transformation and sequestration of soil organic carbon (C) has dramatically increased in recent years due to growing interest in understanding the global C cycle. While it is readily accepted that terrestrial C dynamics are heavily influenced by the catabolic and anabolic activities of microorganisms, the incorporation of microbial biomass components into stable soil C pools (via microbial living cells and necromass) has received less attention. Nevertheless, microbial-derived C inputs to soils are now increasingly recognized as playing a far greater role in stabilization of soil organic matter than previously believed. Our understanding, however, is limited by the difficulties associated with studying microbial turnover in soils. Here, we describe the use of an Absorbing Markov Chain (AMC) to model the dynamics of soil C transformations among three microbial states: living microbial biomass, microbial necromass, and C removed from living and dead microbial sources. We find that AMC provides a powerful quantitative approach that allows prediction of how C will be distributed among these three states, and how long it will take for the entire amount of initial C to pass through the biomass and necromass pools and be moved into atmosphere. Further, assuming constant C inputs to the model, we can predict how C is eventually distributed, along with how much C sequestrated in soil is microbial-derived. Our work represents a first step in attempting to quantify the flow of C through microbial pathways, and has the potential to increase our understanding of the microbial role in soil C dynamics.
41410601|The effect of increased nutrient loads on biogeochemical processes in macrotidal, mangrovelined creeks was studied in tropical Darwin Harbour, Australia. This study uses an integrative approach involving multiple benthic and pelagic processes as measures of ecosystem function, and provides a comparison of these processes in three tidal creeks receiving different loads of treated sewage effluent. There were significant differences in process rates between Buffalo Creek (BC) (hypereutrophic), which receives the largest sewage loads; Myrmidon Creek (MC) (oligotrophic-mesotrophic) which receives smaller sewage inputs; and Reference Creek (RC) (oligotrophic) which is comparatively pristine. Benthic nutrient fluxes and denitrification were more than an order of magnitude higher and lower, respectively, in BC and denitrification efficiency (DE) was <10%. Pelagic primary production rates were also much higher in but respiration exceeded primary production resulting in severe drawdown of O concentrations at night. Hypoxic conditions released oxide-bound phosphorus and inhibited coupled nitrification-denitrification, enhancing benthic nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, leading to a build-up of excess nutrients in the water column. Poor water quality in was exacerbated by limited tidal flushing imposed by a narrow meandering channel and sandbar across the mouth. In contrast to BC,the effect of the sewage load in MC was confined to the water column, and the impact was temporary and highly localized. This is attributed to the effective flushing of the sewage plume with each tidal cycle. Denitrification rates in MC and RC were high (up to 6.83 mmol N m day) and DE was approximately 90%. This study has identified denitrification, benthic nutrient fluxes and pelagic primary production as the biogeochemical processes most affected by nutrient loading in these tidal creek systems. Physical process play a key role and the combined influence of nutrient loading and poor tidal flushing can have serious consequences for ecosystem functioning.
20055203|The distribution and cycling of lead (Pb) was examined in an urban forest of Aleppo pine stand in Athens. Concentrations of the soluble fraction of Pb in bulk and throughfall deposition were low, reflectingthe change in petrol form in recent years. However, Pb concentrations in forest floor remain high due to Pb accumulation in previous years. The soil A horizon showed unexpectedly high levels of Pb concentration resulted probably from Pb migration from organic horizons. Pb concentrations in pine needles, litterfall and wood were low, whereas tree bark acted as a sink for Pb and stored high amounts of the metal.
40343604|Wetlands play an important role in determining the water quality of streams and are generally considered to act as a sink for many reactive species. However, retention of chemical constituents varies seasonally and is affected by hydrologic and biogeochemical processes including water source, mineral weathering, DOC and SPM cycling, redox status, precipitation/dissolution/adsorption, and seasonal events. Relatively little is known about the influence of these factors on trace element cycling in wetland-influenced streams. To explore the role of wetlands with respect to the retention/release of trace elements to streams, we examined temporal and spatial patterns of concentrations of a large suite of trace elements (via ICP-MS) and geochemical drivers in five streams and wetland rivulets draining natural wetlands in a northern Wisconsin watershed as well as in their groundwater sources (terrestrial recharge, lake recharge, and older lake recharge). We performed principal components analyses of the concentrations of elements and their geochemical drivers in both the streams and rivulets to assist in the identification of factors regulating trace element concentrations. Variation in trace and major element concentrations among the streams was strongly related to the proportion of terrestrial recharge contributing to the stream. A dominant influence of water source on rivulet chemistry was supported by association of groundwater-sourced elements (Ba, Ca, Cs, Mg, Na, Si, Sr) with the primary statistical factor. DOC appeared in the first principal component factor for the streams and in the second factor for the rivulets. Strong correlations of Al, Cd, Ce, Cu, La, Pb, Ti, and Zn with DOC supported the important influence of DOC on trace metal cycling. A number of elements in the rivulets (Al, La, Pb, Ti) and streams (Al, Ce, Cr, Cu, La, Pb, Ti, Zn) had a significant particulate cycle. Redox cycling and precipitation/dissolution reactions involving Fe and Mn likely impacted Cu and Mo as evidenced by the low levels in the rivulets. Variance in Fe, Mn and the metal oxy-anions was associated with factors related to redox cycling and adsorption reactions in the wetland sediments. In streams, DOC and metals with a high affinity for DOC were associated with a factor which also included negative loadings for groundwater-sourced elements, reflecting the importance of seasonal hydrologic events which flush DOC and metals from wetland sediments and dilute groundwater sourced metals. Redox processes were of secondary importance in the streams but of primary significance in the rivulets, documenting the importance of anoxic conditions in wetland sediments on groundwater en route to the stream.
1469770|Hydrological restoration of the Southern Everglades will result in increased freshwater flow to the freshwater and estuarine wetlands bordering Florida Bay. We evaluated the contribution of surface freshwater runoff versus atmospheric deposition and ground water on the water and nutrient budgets of these wetlands. These estimates were used to assess the importance of hydrologic inputs and losses relative to sediment burial, denitrification, and nitrogen fixation. We calculated seasonal inputs and outputs of water, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) from surface water, precipitation, and evapotranspiration in the Taylor Slough/C-111 basin wetlands for 1.5 years. Atmospheric deposition was the dominant source of water and TP for these oligotrophic, phosphorus-limited wetlands. Surface water was the major TN source of during the wet season, but on an annual basis was equal to the atmospheric TN deposition. We calculated a net annual import of 31.4 mg m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> P and 694 mg m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> N into the wetland from hydrologic sources. Hydrologic import of P was within range of estimates of sediment P burial (33-70 mg m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> P), while sediment burial of N (1890-4027 mg m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> N) greatly exceeded estimated hydrologic N import. High nitrogen fixation rates or an underestimation of groundwater N flux may explain the discrepancy between estimates of hydrologic N import and sediment N burial rates.
41410604|The effect of eutrophication on particulate amorphous silica (ASi) sequestration was isolated and quantified in Lake St. Croix and Lake Pepin, two natural, human-impacted impoundments of the upper Mississippi River. In contrast to impoundments behind engineered dams, where silica (Si) fluxes may be changed by various aspects of dam construction, these two riverine lakes have long (9,000+ years) sedimentary sequences that record the entire span of cultural eutrophication and the resulting silica sequestration. The concentrations of dissolved silicate (DSi) and ASi in the lake inflows were measured for 1 year to obtain the total flux of bioavailable silica (TSi b = DSi + ASi) to each impoundment. Historical rates of Si sequestration in each lake were determined using ASi burial in multiple sediment cores and modeled estimates of historical TSi b fluxes. The Si trapping efficiency of each lake was found to have increased exponentially with cultural eutrophication (estimated two- to five-fold increase in Lake St. Croix and 9- to 16-fold increase in Lake Pepin over the last 100 years), indicating the degree to which eutrophication of impoundments can reduce silica export to downstream coastal and marine ecosystems. Because these two lakes presently exhibit different degrees of eutrophication, together they depict a relationship between phosphorus concentration and Si trapping efficiency that may be applied to other impoundments, including human-made reservoirs.
1469429|Effects of resuspension on the release of dissolved, redox sensitive elements (Fe, Mn) was studied in cylindrical microcosms. Effects from changing water stirring velocity in sediment pools were evaluated through measurements of pore water profiles of dissolved Mn, Fe and redox potential. Mn was a good natural marker to follow such effects. At current velocities below the threshold velocity for resuspension (37 cm s<sup>-1</sup>), Mn release rates to overlying water were 100 times higher compared to steady-state values. Pulse increases in Mn concentration were the result of convective currents inside flow chambers. These results were strongly supported by measurements of Eh profiles in the sediment pore water. Furthermore, impacts from increasing stirring velocity were found down to 1.9 cm depth below the resuspended layer of sediment.
1468702| The isotopic composition of sulfur in sulfate from precipitation, stream inflows and outflow of the Lake 239 watershed at the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, was monitored for four years, 1982-1985. Rainfall had  <sup>3</sup> S of 3-9 and a three year mean value weighted by the mass of sulfate of 4.8. Sulfur in streams ranged from 5-15 and displayed a pronounced seasonal pattern in which  <sup>34</sup>S showed significant negative correlations with both streamflows and sulfate concentrations. Outflow values were much more constant and averaged 6.4 over the three year period. Sulfate reduction or sorption favoring retention of the lighter isotope in the watershed was the probable cause of the isotopic variation of the sulfur isotopes in the streams. A sulfur isotope budget for the lake balanced within 1. 
20519842|Boreal forests are highly susceptible to wildfire, and post-fire changes in soil temperature and moisture have the potential to transform large areas of the landscape from a net sink to a net source of carbon (C). Understanding the ecological controls that regulate these disturbance effects is critical to developing models of ecosystem response to changes in fire frequency and severity. This paper combines laboratory and field measurements along a chronosequence of burned black spruce stands into regression analyses and models that assess relationships between moss succession, soil microclimate, decomposition, and C source-sink dynamics. Results indicate that post-fire changes in temperature and substrate quality increased decomposition in humic materials by a factor of 3.0 to 4.0 in the first 7 years after fire. Bryophyte species exhibited a distinct successional pattern in the first five decades after fire that corresponded to decreased soil temperature and increased C accumulation in organic soils. Potential rates of C exchange in mosses were greatest in early successional species and declined as the stand matured. Residual sources of CO (those not attributed to moss respiration or humic decomposition) increased as a function of stand age, reflecting increased contributions from roots as the stand recovered from disturbance. Together, the field measurements, laboratory experiments, and models provide strong evidence that interactions between moss and plant succession, soil temperature, and soil moisture largely regulate C source-sink dynamics from black spruce systems in the first century following fire disturbance.
1468629|The turnover of C in soils is controlled mainly by water regimes and temperature, but is modified by factors such as size and physicochemical properties of C additions in litter or root systems, distribution of C throughout the soil as root systems, or addition as litter, distribution of C within the soil matrix and its interaction with clay surfaces. Soil factors which retard mineralization of C in soils are identified from correlations of C contents of soils with other properties such as clay content and base status. The rate and extent of C mineralization depends on the chemistry of the added organic matter and interaction with clays of the microbial biomass and metabolites. The organomineral interactions are shown to depend on cation bridges involving mainly Ca in neutral to alkaline soils, Al in acid soils and adsorption of organic materials on iron oxide surfaces. The various organomineral interactions lead to aggregations of clay particles and organic materials, which stabilizes both soil structure and the carbon compounds within the aggregates.
1468946|We examined the effects of growth carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration and soil nutrient availability on nitrogen (N) transformations and N trace gas fluxes in California grassland microcosms during early-season wet-up, a time when rates of N transformation and N trace gas flux are high. After plant senescence and summer drought, we simulated the first fall rains and examined N cycling. Growth at elevated CO<sub>2</sub> increased root production and root carbon:nitrogen ratio. Under nutrient enrichment, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> increased microbial N immobilization during wet-up, leading to a 43% reduction in gross nitrification and a 55% reduction in NO emission from soil. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> increased microbial N immobilization at ambient nutrients, but did not alter nitrification or NO emission. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> did not alter soil emission of N<sub>2</sub>O at either nutrient level. Addition of NPK fertilizer (1:1:1) stimulated N mineralization and nitrification, leading to increased N<sub>2</sub>O and NO emission from soil. The results of our study support a mechanistic model in which elevated CO<sub>2</sub> alters soil N cycling and NO emission: increased root production and increased C:N ratio in elevated CO<sub>2</sub> stimulate N immobilization, thereby decreasing nitrification and associated NO emission when nutrients are abundant. This model is consistent with our basic understanding of how C availability influences soil N cycling and thus may apply to many terrestrial ecosystems.
40980884|Mineral weathering is the primary source of long-term buffering capacity in soils and is important for forest nutrient sustainability. Regional assessments of weathering rates in Canada and the U. S. have employed an empirical clay-based Soil Texture Approximation (STA) owing to limited data availability, although the STA is rarely calibrated before application to a study area. Soil weathering rates estimated with the STA at 75 sites in Canadian forests (6-367 eq ha year) were on average seven times lower than estimates obtained using the PROFILE model and when mineralogy was not available, the Analysis to Mineralogy model and parameter estimation (143-2,119 eq ha year). catchment mass balance at a subset of sites in Ontario (n = 19) demonstrated the reliability of PROFILE weathering estimates. A revised (generalized) STA model for total base cation weathering was developed at the 75 study sites to incorporate soil silt content (%) and loss-on-ignition (LOI, %) (BC W = (1.73 4-0.03  silt -0.06  LOI)  1,000  depth). The model performance (R adj = 73%) and relative bias (~1%) suggested that the revised STA may have broad application to forest soils in Canada but may not necessarily be suited to all soil texture classes.
1468809| During one year, concentration profiles of sulfate and methane were measured in sediment cores of eutrophic Lake Loosdrecht. Sulfate concentrations decreased exponentially with depth towards a constant threshold value of 7.6  6.1 M. Concentration profiles were used to calculate fluxes of sulfate and methane and to estimate the anaerobic mineralization rate. Anaerobic mineralization was highest in autumn which was probably due to an increased sedimentation of easily degradable organic carbon. At high rates (>600 mol organic carbon.m<sup>-2</sup>.h<sup>-1</sup>), sulfate reduction appeared to be limited by sulfate and methanogenesis accounted for over 80% of the anaerobic mineralization. At low anaerobic mineralization rates, measured in winter and spring, sulfate reduction was predominant. There was little methanogenesis below 5 cm depth in the sediment which indicated a rapid decrease of degradable organic matter with depth. There was a remarkable difference, especially in winter, between methane fluxes which were measured in batch experiments and those calculated from the concentration profiles in the sediment. These differences may be due to methane diffusing upward from deep layers. 
40343640|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have risen in upland waters across large areas of Europe and North America. Two proposed drivers of these increases are (1) deposition of atmospheric pollutant nitrogen (N) with consequent effects on plant and decomposer carbon dynamics, and (2) soil recovery from acidification associated with decreasing sulphur deposition. Examination of 12 European and North American field N addition experiments showed inconsistent (positive, neutral, and negative) responses of DOC to N addition. However, responses were linked to the form of  added and to resulting changes in soil acidity. Sodium nitrate additions consistently increased DOC, whereas ammonium salts additions usually decreased DOC. Leachate chemistry was used to calculate an index of "ANC forcing" of the effect of fertilization on the acid-base balance, which showed that DOC increased in response to all de-acidifying N additions, and decreased in response to all but three acidifying N additions. Exceptions occurred at two sites where N additions caused tree mortality, and one experiment located on an older, unglaciated soil with high anion adsorption capacity. We conclude that collectively these experiments do not provide clear support for the role of N deposition as the sole driver of rising DOC, but are largely consistent with an acidity-change mechanism. It is however possible that the unintended effect of acidity change on DOC mobility masks genuine effects of experimental N enrichment on DOC production and degradation. We suggest that there is a need, more generally, for interpretation of N manipulation experiments to take account of the effects that experimentally-induced changes in acidity, rather than elevated N per se, may have on ecosystem biogeochemistry.
24716798|While epidemiologists have long acknowledged that automobile emissions create corridors of increased NO concentrations near highways, the influence of these emissions on dry nitrogen (N) deposition and effects on surrounding ecosystems are not well-characterized. This study used stable isotopes in plant tissue and dry N deposition to examine the extent of N deposition from automobile emissions along a roadside transect spanning 400 m perpendicular to a moderately trafficked highway (33,000 vehicles per day). Passive samplers were deployed monthly for four months at six stations to collect dry deposition of nitric acid (HNO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO), analyzed for concentration and natural abundance isotopic composition (N). Agrostis perennans (bentgrass) and Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) were deployed as biomonitors to examine relative sources of N to plant tissue. Both NO flux and NNO values were significantly higher close to the road indicating a high proportion of automobile-sourced N is deposited near-road. Further, this near-road deposition occurred primarily as NO prior to oxidation to HNO, as HNO fluxes were an order of magnitude lower than NO fluxes and were highest midway through the transect. Plant tissue N values were higher near the road, signifying the influence of automobile emissions on plant tissue composition. Importantly, N flux near the road was four times higher than background N flux measured at the nearest regional dry deposition monitoring locations. We extrapolated these results to demonstrate that the observed spatial patterns of concentrated N deposition impact our understanding of regional N deposition to watersheds when applied to a metropolitan area.
41490432|Lake Superior, one of the largest lakes in the world, is an ecosystem where nitrate (NO) concentration has risen almost fivefold in the last century. Recent studies suggest that this increase may be due to lack of a significant nitrogen (N) sink, such as sedimentary denitrification or burial, because of low organic matter supply to the lake bottom. In light of these new findings, it is imperative to examine the origin and transformation of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) in the lake as N biogeochemistry is inextricably linked to POM dynamics. We present an analysis of spatial and temporal variations in N of POM (N POM ) in the lake and draining rivers based on extensive sampling and a synthesis of recent studies of N cycling. The N POM in the lake ranged from 4.7 to 7.6% o and showed a significant (p < 0.001) temporal variability in the surface waters with relatively enriched N during winter (mean  SD ~ 1.5  2.3%; n = 13) compared to summer (mean  SD ~ 2.0  1.4%; n = 20). Temporal variability in N POM and data for N of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) together suggest a seasonal shift in nutrient sources for plankton along with possible detrital and higher trophic level contributions to POM during winter. On an annual basis, ammonium (NH) appears to be the dominant N source to plankton in the lake. NO use was lower but seasonally variable with higher contributions to plankton in summer than winter. During a period of high riverine discharge, no significant difference in coastal and open-lake N POM was found, indicating limited effect of riverine POM on the lake. Significant increase in N POM and decreases in particulate N concentration with depth indicate transformations of organic matter settling to the lake bottom that are consistent with the hypothesized influence of low organic matter supply to the lake bottom leading to limited benthic denitrification.
40343575|The radiocarbon signature of the atmosphere is frequently used as a tracer to derive and validate turnover estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC). Such models often rely on steady-state assumptions and presume a direct correspondence between the atmospheric signature of CO and that of residues entering the soil with or without a time-lag. The input of combustion products either from recent (i.e. charcoal) or fossil sources (e.g. diesel soot) violates this premise on account of its non-continuous delivery over time, the lack of C in fossil black carbon (BC) and its high inertness compared to plant residues. In this study, possible effects of BC inputs (0.6-5 t BC ha of different C age and supplied at different dates) on turnover calculations are discussed using hypothetical but realistic scenarios for two sites: cold grassland and temperate cropland. The carbon turnover model RothC 26.3 was used for the simulations. Turnover times may be over-or underestimated by up to 30%, depending on the underlying scenario. In the majority of cases, such effects are more pronounced and longer lasting at the colder site owing to its slower cycling. The models' inherent inert carbon pool improves the match of turnover times compared to runs where inert carbon is not accounted for. This is, however, achieved at the expense of mismatching the amount of BC when the latter is C-young. The impact of BC on C-based turnover calculations is disproportionate with respect to its amount, and an independent record of carbon fluxes and/or BC inputs and characteristics is suggested whenever BC is assumed to play a role in the ecosystem under investigation.
1469051|The stable isotope <sup>15</sup>N was added as (<sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to throughfall water for one year, to study the fate of the deposited nitrogen at different levels of N deposition in two "N saturated" coniferous forests ecosystems in the Netherlands. The fate of the <sup>15</sup>N was followed at high-N (44-55 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) and low-N (4-6 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) deposition in plots established under transparent roofs build under the canopy in a Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest. The applied <sup>15</sup>N was detectable in needles and twigs, the soil and soil water leaching below the rooting zone (90 cm depth). Total <sup>15</sup>N recovery in major ecosystem compartments was 71-100% during two successive growing seasons after the start of a year-round <sup>15</sup>N application to throughfall-N. Nine months after the year-round <sup>15</sup>N application, the <sup>15</sup>N assimilated into tree biomass was 29-33% of the <sup>15</sup>N added in the Douglas fir stand and less than 17% in the Scots pine stand. At the same time total <sup>15</sup>N retention in the soil (down to 70 cm) of the high-N plots was about 37% of the deposited <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>-N, whereas 46% and 65% of the <sup>15</sup>N was found in the soil of the low-N deposition plots at the Douglas fir and Scots pine stand, respectively. The organic layers accounted for 60% of the <sup>15</sup>N retained in the soil. The total N deposition exceeded the demand of the vegetation and microbial immobilization. Total <sup>15</sup>N leaching losses within a year (below 90 cm) were 10-20% in the high-N deposition plots in comparison to 2-6% in the lowered nitrogen input plots. Relative retention in the soil and vegetation increased at lower N-input levels. Species differences in uptake and tree health seem to contribute to lower <sup>15</sup>N recoveries in the Scots pine trees compared to the Douglas fir trees. The excessive N deposition and resulting "N saturation" lead to conditions were the health and functioning of biota were negatively influenced. At decreased N deposition, lower leaching losses together with increased soil and plant retention indicated a change in the fate of the <sup>15</sup>N deposited. This may have resulted from changes in ecosystem processes, and thus a shift along the continuum of N saturation to N limitation.
1469329|Preliminary studies of mercury (Hg) cycling in the Everglades revealed that dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM), total mercury (Hg<sub>T</sub>), and reactive mercury (Hg<sub>R</sub>) show reproducible, diel trends. Peak water-column DGM concentrations were observed on or about noon, with a 3 to 7 fold increase over night-time concentrations. Production of DGM appears to cease during dark periods, with nearly constant water column concentrations that were at or near saturation with respect to the overlying air. A simple mass balance shows that the flux of Hg to the atmosphere from diel DGM production and evasion represents about 10% of the annual input from atmospheric deposition. Production of DGM is likely the result of an indirect photolysis reaction that involves the production of reductive species and/or reduction by electron transfer. Diel variability in Hg<sub>T</sub> and Hg<sub>R</sub> appears to be controlled by two factors: inputs from rainfall and photolytic sorption/desorption processes. A possible mechanism involves photolysis of chromophores on the surface of a solid substrate (e.g., the periphyton mat) giving rise to destabilization of sorbed mercury and net desorption during daylight. At night, the sorption reactions predominate and the water-column Hg<sub>T</sub> decreases. Methylmercury (MeHg) also showed diel trends in concentration but were not clearly linked to the solar cycle or rainfall at the study site.
24715153|We measured CO and CH concentrations throughout the water columns of two boreal lakes with contrasting trophic status and water color during a wet summer. Previous work suggested that rainfall was important for carbon gas evasion. During the stratified period, precipitation generated unexpected variabilities in CO, CH, and DOC concentrations below the euphotic zone, especially in the metalimnion. The DOC concentrations after the rains rose to 22 and 10 mg L from the initial 13 and 8 mg L, in the humic and clear-water lakes respectively, simultaneously with an increase in carbon gas concentrations. In both lakes, the water column was stable, suggesting that the high gas concentrations were not due to transport from hypolimnia rich in carbon gases. The high concentrations of CH, which can only be produced in anoxic conditions, in the oxic metalimnion and epilimnion in comparison to the hypolimnetic concentrations indicated that a considerable proportion of the pelagic CH originated from the catchment and/or the littoral zone. Thus, as a consequence of high levels of precipitation, carbon gas concentrations during summer stratification can increase, which can have overall importance in annual carbon budgets.
1468748|Wave-like patterns of mortality and regeneration of balsam fir (Abies balsamea {L.} Mill.) and Fraser fir (A. fraseri {Pursh.} Poir.) forests at high elevations in the Appalachian Mountains offer a unique opportunity to study the effects of stand development on nitrogen cycling. We sampled two fir waves, one with Fraser fir on Mt. LeConte in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and one with balsam fir on Whiteface Mountain in New York. Net nitrogen mineralization for 3 summer months at Mt. LeConte was high in the dead fir zone (47 kg-N/ha), lower in the regeneration and juvenile zones (24 and 21 kg-N/ha), and highest in the mature zone (61 kg-N/ha). This sampling period probably accounted for about 60% of the annual total. The pattern was similar in the balsam fir wave on Whiteface Mountain, with N mineralization rates of 39 and 33 kg-N/ha over 2 months for the regenerating and juvenile zones, and 43 and 54 kg-N/ha for the mature and dead zones. Throughfall nitrogen followed a fairly similar pattern, with rates ranging from 4.5 to 10 kg-N/ha for 2 or 3 months across all zones at both sites. Tension-free lysimeters indicated very little leaching of nitrogen below 30 cm depth (the maximum was 2.6 kg-N/ha), but these estimates may be low. We conclude that nitrogen mineralization is high at all stages of stand development, perhaps exceeding the uptake capacity of the trees. Rates of nitrogen leaching may be high in these ecosystems and should receive further attention.
41490554|Here we analyse the radiative forcing implications of forest fertilization and biomass substitution, with explicit consideration of the temporal patterns of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to and removals from the atmosphere (net emissions). We model and compare the production and use of biomass from a hectare of fertilized and non-fertilized forest land in northern Sweden. We calculate the annual net emissions of CO, NO and CH for each system, over a 225-year period with 1-year time steps. We calculate the annual atmospheric concentration decay of each of these emissions, and calculate the resulting annual changes in instantaneous and cumulative radiative forcing. We find that forest fertilization can significantly increase biomass production, which increases the potential for material and energy substitution. The average carbon stock in tree biomass, forest soils and wood products all increase when fertilization is used. The additional GHG emissions due to fertilizer production and application are small compared to increases in substitution benefits and carbon stock. The radiative forcing of the 2 stands is identical for the first 15 years, followed by 2 years during which the fertilized stand produces slightly more radiative forcing. After year 18 the instantaneous and cumulative radiative forcing are consistently lower for the fertilized forest system. Both stands result in longterm negative radiative forcing, or cooling of the earth system. By the end of the 225-year simulation period, the cumulative radiative forcing reduction of the fertilized stand is over twice that of the nonfertilized stand. This suggests that forest fertilization and biomass substitution are effective options for climate change mitigation, as climate change is a long term issue.
20519810|Anoxic wetlands are an important source for the greenhouse gas CH, much of which is emitted in form of gas bubbles. The conditions for formation of gas bubbles have recently been described by an analytical model, which allows the prediction of fluxes by first physical principles using the knowledge of gas concentration profiles and/or gas production rates. We tested parts of this model by experiments using microcosms of flooded, non-vegetated and homogeneous rice field soil incubated under different gas atmospheres and at different temperatures. In these experiments we determined rates of CH and CO production, upper boundaries of the bubble zone, gas-filled porosities and vertical profiles of dissolved CH, CO and N. The results of our experiments confirmed that by knowing only one of the following parameters, i.e. CH production, diffusive CH flux and depth of upper boundary of bubble zone, the remainder could be predicted from the model. On average, predicted values differed from experimental ones by a factor of 0.4-2.7, depending on which parameter was taken as an input for the model. It was possible to predict the percentage of gas bubble flux from measured CH emission rates under the experimental conditions, which was on the order of 90%. The confrontation of the model with experimental data showed that the effect of the shallow upper oxic layer on bubble formation was negligible and that the CH diffusive flux is easily underestimated by experiments lacking sufficient spatial resolution. Therefore, CH production rates lower than in our microcosms would allow a more precise test of the model by creating less steep concentration gradients, which, however, would require long incubation times to purge the dissolved N from the soil by ebullition and to reach true steady state.
40343560|Denitrification rates and nitrous oxide (NO) effluxes were measured at different temperatures and for different oxygen concentrations in the sediments of a eutrophied river entering the Bothnian Bay. The experiments were made in a laboratory microcosm with intact sediment samples. N-labelling was used to measure denitrification rates (Dw). The rates were measured at four temperatures (5, 10, 15 and 20C) and with three oxygen inputs(<0.2, 5, and 10 mg O 1). The temperature response was highly affected by oxygen concentration. At higher O concentrations (5 and 10 mg O 1) a saturation over 10C was observed, whereas the anoxic treatment (<0.2 mg O 1) showed an exponential increase in the temperature interval with a Q value of 3.1. The result is described with a combined statistical model. In contrast with overall denitrification, the NO effluxes from sediments decreased with increasing temperature. The NO effluxes had a lower response to oxygen than denitrification rates. The NO/N ratio was always below 0.02. Increased temperatures in the future could enhance denitrification rates in boreal river sediments but would not increase the amount of NO produced.
1469537|Two identical experiments with sieved and homogenized sandy and muddy sediment were conducted to determine transport enhancement of porewater solutes (TCO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) by the presence of the polychaete Nereis diversicolor (1000-1500 m<sup>-2</sup>). Flux measurements showed that N. diversicolor enhanced the release of CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> 1.5-5 times. Accordingly, porewater concentrations of these compounds were reduced considerably in the bioturbated zone of both types of sediments. Two different diagenetic models, "effective (eddy) diffusion" and "nonlocal exchange", were used to describe solute profiles in the bioturbated sediments. In permeable sandy sediments advective porewater movements may occur more readily than in more cohesive muddy sediments. The "effective diffusion" model (with D<sub>e</sub>=1.6-2.0 cm<sup>2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) provided an excellent fit to the measured concentrations of both solutes below the bioturbated zone in permeable sandy sediment, whereas this model overestimated the concentration in the bioturbated zone. However, in the less permeable muddy sediment the "effective diffusion" model overestimated the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> profile considerably at all depths. The "nonlocal exchange" model (with  =0.17-0.29 d<sup>-1</sup>), on the other hand, provided an excellent fit in the less permeable muddy sediment, suggesting that solute profiles here were controlled by molecular diffusion, even in the presence of burrow irrigation. For the permeable sediment, the "nonlocal exchange" model (with  =0.14 d<sup>-1</sup>) underestimated the measured NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> profile. Accordingly, linear slopes from plots of porewater TCO<sub>2</sub> as a function of porewater NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> revealed that eddy diffusion (or advective porewater movements) was important in the bioturbated zone of this sediment type. However, combined with the generally more realistic shape of profiles derived by the "nonlocal exchange", these evidences suggest that both eddy and molecular diffusion must operate in the bioturbated zone of permeable sediments.
24715356|Once CO is emitted into the atmosphere, it is gradually absorbed by natural carbon sinks. Its airborne fraction changes as a function of time depending on the sequestering performance of the sinks, in particular on their characteristic times, as reproduced by carbon cycle models. It is accepted that even after a time of the order of several thousands of years the atmospheric concentration will not return to its original value prior to the CO injection. The fraction of the injected CO amount that remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years is measured by the atmospheric retention factor (ARF). The knowledge of this parameter is of great importance to accurately project both CO concentration and temperature changes in the next decades and centuries; However, current ARF estimates span a broad range from  10 to  30 %, clustering on average around  20 %. Here we employ two new approaches that allow us to constrain the ARF value. The first method is based on the paleoclimatic information about the coupling between CO and temperature changes during the last glacial-to-interglacial transition. The second approach takes advantage of the CO concentration changes, that are detectable in the paleoclimatic records of the last centuries, in response to comet-induced periodic cooling episodes. We find ARF estimates of 18 and 23 %, respectively, from the two approaches. The present results confirm that the ARF is likely to be around 20 %, in agreement with pre-existing estimates.
1469087|Quantitative information regarding landscape sources and pathways of organic matter transport to streams is important for assessing impacts of terrestrial processes on aquatic ecosystems. We quantified organic C, a measure of organic matter, flowing from a blackwater stream draining a 12.6 km<sup>2</sup> watershed on the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain in South Carolina, and utilized a hydrologic approach to partition this outflow between its various pathways from upland and wetland forest sources. Results of this study indicate that 28.9 tonnes C yr<sup>-1</sup> were exported in stream flow, which was estimated to be 0.5% of the annual C input from forest detritus to the watershed. Upland forest, which covers 94% of the watershed area, contributed only 2.0 tonnes C yr<sup>-1</sup> to stream flow, which amounted to 0.04% of detritus annually produced by the upland forest. Organic matter was transported from uplands to the stream almost entirely through groundwater. Apparently, upland soils are too sandy to support overland flow, and the sloping topography insufficiently extensive or steep enough to drive important quantities of interflow. Riparian wetland forest, which covers only 6% of the watershed area, contributed 26.9 tonnes C yr<sup>-1</sup> to stream flow, amounting to about 10.2% of detritus annually produced by the wetland forest. Dissolved organic C leached from wetland soil accounted for 63% of all organic C entering the stream, and was transported chiefly in baseflow. These results indicate that upland detritus sources are effectively decoupled from the stream despite the sandy soils and quantitatively confirm that even small riparian wetland areas can have a dominant effect on the overall organic matter budget of a blackwater stream. In view of the recognized importance of dissolved organic matter in facilitating transport of other substances (e.g., cation nutrients, metals, and insoluble organic compounds), our results suggest that the potential for movement of these substances through wetland soils to streams in this region is high.
20456477|The worldwide colony-forming haptophyte phytoplankton Phaeocystis spp. are key organisms in trophic and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Many organisms from protists to fish ingest cells and/or colonies of Phaeocystis. Reports on specific mortality of Phaeocystis in natural plankton or mixed prey due to grazing by zooplankton, especially protozooplankton, are still limited. Reported feeding rates vary widely for both crustaceans and protists feeding on even the same Phaeocystis types and sizes. Quantitative analysis of available data showed that: (1) laboratory-derived crustacean grazing rates on monocultures of Phaeocystis may have been overestimated compared to feeding in natural plankton communities, and should be treated with caution; (2) formation of colonies by P. globosa appeared to reduce predation by small copepods (e.g., Acartia, Pseudocalanus, Temora and Centropages), whereas large copepods (e.g., Calanus spp.) were able to feed on colonies of Phaeocystis pouchetii; (3) physiological differences between different growth states, species, strains, cell types, and laboratory culture versus natural assemblages may explain most of the variations in reported feeding rates; (4) chemical signaling between predator and prey may be a major factor controlling grazing on Phaeocystis; (5) it is unclear to what extent different zooplankton, especially protozooplankton, feed on the different life forms of Phaeocystis in situ. To better understand the mechanisms controlling zooplankton grazing in situ, future studies should aim at quantifying specific feeding rates on different Phaeocystis species, strains, cell types, prey sizes and growth states, and account for chemical signaling between the predator and prey. Recently developed molecular tools are promising approaches to achieve this goal in the future.
1469495| Gaseous acids can be emitted as well as taken up by plant foliage, but little is known about the influence of environmental factors on the exchange process. In a laboratory study we investigated the short-term effects of temperature and light on the exchange of acetic and formic acids between orange foliage and the atmosphere. The results were compared with diurnal exchange cycles obtained with the same species under field conditions. In the field, the exchange of volatile acids showed pronounced diurnal variations with maximum emissions of about 0.15 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> projected leaf area s<sup>-1</sup> for acetic acid and 0.3 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for formic acid during noon and afternoon and with acid deposition of up to 0.1 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for both acids during early morning and night. Under laboratory conditions no significant acid deposition (<0.01 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) could be observed, and emission rates were lower than in the field and ranged around 0.035 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (SD = 0.013) for acetic acid and about 0.08 nmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for formic acid (SD = 0.033) at 30 C and 1000  mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> PAR. A clear positive response of acid release to light could be observed. Emissions were very low in darkness and strongly increased with light up to 1000  mol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> PAR. The emission response to light occurred within our hour and was also observed with other acids emitting plant species investigated. Response of emission to temperature was more variable, though, on the whole, the effect was also positive. Finally, we observed a diurnal rhythm in acid release which was not related to other measured climatic or physiological parameters. We conclude that in the short-term the exchange of volatile acids between leaves and air under natural conditions is stimulated by light and, somewhat, by temperature, while a leaf-internal process promotes acid release in the morning and higher acid concentrations in ambient air promote acid deposition.

20456415|A meta-analysis was conducted on 136 data sets of denitrification rates (DR) recorded both during the period of highest water temperature and monthly in five types of aquatic ecosystems: oceans, coastal environments, estuaries, lakes and rivers. There was a gradual increase of DR from the ocean to rivers and lakes at both scales, with the rivers showing the highest DR variability. Denitrification peaked during summertime and showed highest seasonal variability in lakes and rivers. High concentrations of nitrate and interstitially-dissolved organic carbon as well as low oxygen concentration in the overlying water enhanced DR both during summer and at a seasonal scale whereas total phosphorus did at the seasonal scale only. There was a positive linear relationship between overlying nitrate and DR over the range of 1-970 mol NO (R = 0.86, P = 0.001). DR in lakes and rivers might reach values doubling those in the more denitrifying terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. agrosystems). Discrepancies in DR and its controlling factors between site-specific studies and this meta-analysis may arise from environmental variability at two, often confounded, scales of observation: the habitat and the ecosystem level. Future studies on denitrification in aquatic environments should address the topic of spatial heterogeneity more thoroughly.
1468528|A basic geochemical approach has been used to study the diagenetic cycling and sediment-water exchange rates of essential nutrients at a site in a Delaware salt marsh. The pore water nutrients Si (OH)<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>-3</sup>, and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were analyzed and compared seasonally, and potential diffusive fluxes were calculated from the corresponding pore water concentration gradients. Concurrent direct flux measurements were also made using closed chambers deployed on the salt marsh surface under ambient and controlled conditions. The differences in these two approaches allows for estimation of nutrient production and consumption in the root zone and at the salt marsh surface. Silicate and phosphate appear to be primarily geochemically controlled, while the nitrogen species undergo dynamic seasonal redox fluctuations resulting from microbial mediation (e.g., nitrification and denitrification). Specifically: - silicate behaves rather conservatively according to silica solubility, - phosphate flux is controlled by the corresponding sequestering or reductive remobilization of surface iron oxides, and - ammonium has a strong upward flux which appears to undergo quantitative nitrification in spring. None of the measured flux rates would have a major impact on the nutrient budget for the local estuary, Delaware Bay.
41490551|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was characterized during five basin-scale investigations (either after storms or in droughts) in Jiulong River, China that is affected by the Asian Monsoon, tropical storms and anthropogenic activities. Dissolved organic carbon concentration, DOM absorption and fluorescence (excitation-emission matrix spectra, EEMs) were measured. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of EEMs identified three humic-like and two proteinlike fluorescent components. DOM concentration was highest at two polluted stations in droughts while lowest in pristine headwaters (station N1). DOM concentration increased most evidently after storms in May, 2009, indicating effective flushing of DOM from land to the river close to the onset of flood season. The protein-like fraction in PARAFAC results decreased after storms in May and June, 2009, highlighting changes in DOM composition and thus its environmental role. Dam constructions likely increased the residence time of DOM in river, making the inflow of DOM during storms have more implications for the riverine (in comparison with estuarine) biogeochemical processes. The effect of storm in August, 2008 after intense DOM flushing during several preceding storms, was not evident. A severe dinoflagellate algal bloom occurred during the extreme drought in the lower watershed, which increased DOM concentration and the protein-like fraction at impacted stations. Different DOM compositions during and after algal bloom were discriminated using the two protein-like components. This study demonstrates the importance of hydrologie regimes and anthropogenic activities on freshwater DOM and its environmental role, which has implications for a number of other rivers that share similar characteristics.
1468640|The present article centres on the contribution of soil animals to organic matter decomposition and nitrogen mineralization in natural and agro-ecosystems. Criteria are presented for the categorisation of the soil fauna in functional groups in order to be able to quantify the contribution of the soil fauna. Three types of classifications: size, habitat and food, are discussed. For various natural ecosystems, such as prairies and forests, and for agro-ecosystems a rather similar outcome of the faunal contribution to nitrogen mobilization of approximately 30% appears to exist. This value is dependent on various types of interactions among functional groups, changes in population density of microorganisms and soil fauna, seasonally changing abiotic factors and management, such as fertilization, harvesting and addition of harvest residues to the soil. Finally, to improve management of ecosystems as related to soil faunal activity in decomposition, lines are set out for further research such as the development of dynamic models, studies concerning the effects of perturbation in relation to microbial dominance and the integration of the study of below-ground food webs with ecological theories.
1468882|Nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic N, and dissolved oxygen were measured in stream water and shallow groundwater in the riparian zones of two tropical watersheds with different soils and geomorphology. At both sites, concentrations of dissolved inorganic N (DIN; NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>- and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N) were low in stream water (< 110 ug/L). Markedly different patterns in DIN were observed in groundwater collected at the two sites. At the first site (Icacos watershed), DIN in upslope groundwater was dominated by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N (550 ug/L) and oxygen concentrations were high (5.2 mg/L). As groundwater moved through the floodplain and to the stream, DIN shifted to dominance by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N (200-700 ug/L) and groundwater was often anoxic. At the second site (Bisley watershed), average concentrations of total dissolved nitrogen were considerably lower (300 ug/L) than at Icacos (600 ug/L), and the dominant form of nitrogen was DON rather than inorganic N. Concentrations of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were similar throughout the riparian zone at Bisley, but concentrations of DON declined from upslope wells to stream water. Differences in speciation and concentration of nitrogen in groundwater collected at the two sites appear to be controlled by differences in redox conditions and accessibility of dissolved N to plant roots, which are themselves the result of geomorphological differences between the two watersheds. At the Icacos site, a deep layer of coarse sand conducts subsurface water to the stream below the rooting zone of riparian vegetation and through zones of strong horizontal redox zonation. At the Bisley site, infiltration is impeded by dense clays and saturated flow passes through the variably oxidized rooting zone. At both sites, hydrologic export of nitrogen is controlled by intense biotic activity in the riparian zone. However, geomorphology appears to strongly modify the importance of specific biotic components.
40980896|Pollution of inland waters by agricultural land use is a concern in many areas of the world, and especially in arid regions, where water resources are inherently scarce. This study used physical and chemical water quality and stable nitrogen isotope (N) measurements from Zooplankton to examine nitrogen (N) sources and concentrations in four small lakes of Khorezm, Uzbekistan, an arid, highly agricultural region, which is part of the environmentallyimpacted Aral Sea Basin. During the 2-year study period, ammonium concentrations were the highest dissolved inorganic N species in all lakes, with a maximum of 3.00 mg N I and an average concentration of 0.62 mg N I. Nitrate levels were low, with a maximum concentration of 0.46 mg N I and an average of 0.05 mg N I for all four lakes. The limited Zooplankton N values did not correlate with the high loads of synthetic fertilizer applied to local croplands during summer months. These results suggest that the N cycles in these lakes may be more influenced by regional dynamics than agricultural activity in the immediate surroundings. The Amu-Darya River, which provides the main source of irrigation water to the region, was identified as a possible source of the primary N input to the lakes.
1469553| Soil respiration rates vary significantly among major plant biomes, suggesting that vegetation type influences the rate of soil respiration. However, correlations among climatic factors, vegetation distributions, and soil respiration rates make cause-effect arguments difficult. Vegetation may affect soil respiration by influencing soil microclimate and structure, the quantity of detritus supplied to the soil, the quality of that detritus, and the overall rate of root respiration. At the global scale, soil respiration rates correlate positively with litterfall rates in forests, as previously reported, and with aboveground net primary productivity in grasslands, providing evidence of the importance of detritus supply. To determine the direction and magnitude of the effect of vegetation type on soil respiration, we collated data from published studies where soil respiration rates were measured simultaneously in two or more plant communities. We found no predictable differences in soil respiration between cropped and vegetation-free soils, between forested and cropped soils, or between grassland and cropped soils, possibly due to the diversity of crops and cropping systems included. Factors such as temperature, moisture availability, and substrate properties that simultaneously influence the production and consumption of organic matter are more important in controlling the overall rate of soil respiration than is vegetation type in most cases. However, coniferous forests had 10% lower rates of soil respiration than did adjacent broad-leaved forests growing on the same soil type, and grasslands had, on average, 20% higher soil respiration rates than did comparable forest stands, demonstrating that vegetation type does in some cases significantly affect rates of soil respiration. 
20519869|We performed surveys of nitrogen (N)-fixation in three oligotrophic lake-stream systems in the Sawtooth Mountains of central Idaho to address two questions: (1) Which habitat types within linked lake-stream systems (lake pelagic, lake benthic, and stream) exhibit the highest rates of N fixation?, and (2) How does N fixation compare to the hydrologic flux of nitrogen? A seasonal survey showed that N fixation in a single lake and its outlet stream peaked in late summer, when hydrologic N fluxes were lowest. Benthic lake N-fixation rates by epiphytes were highest at mid-lake depths, where their percent cover was highest, while rates by epipelon were greatest at shallow lake depths. Pelagic N fixation was below detection. Stream N-fixation rates were greatest on rock substrates and in the lake outlet stream. These patterns were supported by a baseflow survey (late July) in three lake-stream ecosystems which confirmed that N-fixation rates peaked in the lake benthos at shallow depths and on rock substrates in outlet streams. Scaling N-fixation rates to whole lake and stream areas revealed that N fixation could exceed the nitrate, and sometimes the total dissolved nitrogen flux during baseflow in lakes and outlet streams. Despite low rates, total N-fixation contributions (kg/day) from lakes were greater because they had far larger surface areas than the stream environments. Fixed nitrogen contributions from stream outlets were also relatively high because of high N-fixation rates and despite low surface areas. This study suggests that N fixation could be a seasonally important nitrogen source to nutrient deficient subalpine lake-stream ecosystems. In addition, the frequency and location of lakes could control N-fixation contributions to watersheds by providing a large area for within-lake N fixation, and creating conditions favorable for N fixation in outlet streams.
1468872| Sulfur dynamics of two Spodosols were ascertained using soil columns constructed from homogenized mineral soil from nothern hardwood ecosystems at the Huntington Forest (HF) in the Adirondack Mountains of New York and Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM). Columns were leached for 20 weeks with a simulated throughfall solution with <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Sulfur constituents were similar to those of other Spodosols, with the organic S fractions (C-bonded S and ester sulfate) constituting over 90% of total S. HF soil columns had higher total S (14.9 mol Sg<sup>-1</sup>) than that for the BBWM soil columns (7.4 mol g<sup>-1</sup>) primarily due to higher C-bonded S in the former. Initially, adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> accounted for 5 and 4% of total S for the BBWM and HF soil columns, respectively. After 20 weeks, adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> decreased (81%) in BBWM and increased (33%) in HF soil columns. For both HF and BBWM soil columns, C-bonded S increased and ester sulfate decreased, but only for HF columns was there a net mineralization of organic S (5.6% of total S). The greatest decrease in ester sulfate occurred at the top of the columns. Leaching of <sup>35</sup>S was less than 0.5% of the <sup>35</sup>S added due to its retention in various S constituents. There was an exponential decrease in <sup>35</sup>S with column depth and most of the radioisotope was found in C-bonded S (70-88 and 70-91% for BBWM and HF, respectively). The rapid turnover of adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was reflected in its high specific activity (834 and 26 kBq  mol<sup>-1</sup> S for BBWM and HF, respectively). The lower specific activity of adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in HF was attributable to greater isotopic dilution by non-radioactive SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> derived from greater organic S mineralization in the HF versus the BBWM columns. Both soil columns initially had high levels of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> which resulted in the generation of H<sup>+</sup> and net retention of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the early phase of the experiment due to pH dependent sulfate adsorption; later NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> decreased and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was desorbed. Leaching of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was correlated with losses of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> of which the latter was the dominant cation. Analyses using both S mass balances and radioisotopes corroborate that for BBWM soil columns, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption-desorption dominated the S biogeochemistry while in HF soil columns, organic S mineralization-immobilization processes were more important. It is suggested that similar techniques can be applied to soils in the field to ascertain the relative importances of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption processes and organic S dynamics. 
41490453|Soil-feeding termites are abundant and play important roles in the biogeochemical processes in tropical soils. Previous studies indicated that they preferentially utilize the peptidic components of soil organic matter as a nutrient resource. Here, we determined the corresponding mineralization fluxes and elucidated other N transformation processes that occur during soil gut passage using N tracer techniques. Termite-based rates of N mineralization by Cubitermes umbratus and Cubitermes ugandensis in soil microcosms amended with NH + were 6.6 and 9.2 nmol N day (g fresh wt) which means that the soil peptides fuel about 20 and 40% of the respiratory activity of these insects. Considering the areal biomass of soil-feeding termites in humid savannahs, soilfeeding termites should mineralize about 3% of the total N in their food soil per year. In addition to producing ammonia from ingested NO at approximately 10% of the mineralization rate, C. umbratus also formed N at similar rates. The formation of labelled N in microcosms amended with NH+ seems to be at least partially due to nitrification activity in the soil; evidence for the formation of nitrate in the posterior hindgut remains inconclusive. However, the so far unexplained increase of N abundance in the ammonia pools of the posterior hindgut compartments manifests additional hitherto unknown metabolic processes in this gut region. Collectively, our results not only reinforce the concept of nitrogenous soil components as an important dietary resource for soil-feeding termites, but also allow us to predict that N mineralization and nitrate ammonification activities in the termite gut should positively affect the dynamics of N in tropical soil.
20519772|The N, P, and S cycles in pristine forests are assumed to differ from those of anthropogenically impacted areas, but there are only a few studies to support this. Our objective was therefore to assess the controls of N, P, and S release, immobilization, and transport in a remote tropical montane forest. The study forest is located on steep slopes of the northern Andes in Ecuador. We determined the concentrations of NO-N, NH-N, dissolved organic N (DON), PO-P, dissolved organic P (DOP), SO-S, dissolved organic S (DOS), and dissolved organic C (DOC) in rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, lateral flow (in the organic layer), litter leachate, mineral soil solution, and stream water of three 8-13 ha catchments (1900-2200 m a.s.l.). The organic forms of N, P, and S contributed, on average, 55, 66, and 63% to the total N, P, and S concentrations in all ecosystem fluxes, respectively. The organic layer was the largest source of all N, P, and S species except for inorganic P and S. Most PO was released in the canopy by leaching and most SO in the mineral soil by weathering. The mineral soil was a sink for all studied compounds except for SO. Consequently, concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic N and P were as low in stream water (TDN: 0.34-0.39 mg N l, P not detectable) as in rainfall (TDN: 0.39-0.48 mg N l, P not detectable), whereas total S concentrations were elevated (stream water: 0.04-0.15, rainfall: 0.01-0.07 mg S l). Dissolved N, P, and S forms were positively correlated with pH at the scale of soil peda except inorganic S. Soil drying and rewetting promoted the release of dissolved inorganic N. High discharge levels following heavy rainstorms were associated with increased DOC, DON, NO-N and partly also NH-N concentrations in stream water. Nitrate-N concentrations in the stream water were positively correlated with stream discharge during the wetter period of the year. Our results demonstrate that the sources and sinks of N, P, and S were element-specific. More than half of the cycling N, P, and S was organic. Soil pH and moisture were important controls of N, P, and S solubility at the scale of individual soil peda whereas the flow regime influenced the export with stream water.
1468971|The biogeochemistry of mangrove sediments was investigated in several mangrove forest communities in Gazi Bay, a coastal lagoon in Kenya, Africa. Carbon dioxide fluxes, sediment median grain sizes, sedimentary organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents and pore-water characteristics (ammonium, nitrate, sulfate and chloride) could be related to forest type. Mangrove sediments have pH values that range from 3.5 to 8.3 due to the limited buffer capacity of these sediments and intense acidifying processes such as aerobic degradation of organic matter, oxidation of reduced components, ammonium uptake by roots and root respiration. The mangrove sediments are nitrogen-rich compared to mangrove litter, as a result of microbial nitrogen retention, uptake and fixation, and import of nitrogen-rich material. It appears that mangrove sediments in Gazi Bay act as a nutrient and carbon sink rather than as a source for adjacent seagrass and reef ecosystems.
1469218|Nitrogen mass balances for seven unproductive lakes and 20 forested catchments in central Ontario were measured between 1977 and 1989. Average annual lake denitrification rates calculated with the N/P ratio method were strongly correlated with summer anoxic factor (extent of surficial sediment anoxia) whereas denitrification rates calculated with a <sup>210</sup>Pb sediment N accumulation method were poorly correlated with the anoxic factor suggesting that the N/P method is superior. Substantial denitrification occurred in all lakes -- an average of 36% of TN inputs or 75% of the net gain. On a regional area-weighted basis, 67% of bulk atmospheric TN deposition was stored or denitrified terrestrially, 12% was denitrified in lakes, 4% was stored in lake sediments, and 17% was exported from lakes. N/P ratios were generally less in streams than in precipitation suggesting preferential N retention in catchments, whereas the N/P ratios in lake outputs were slightly higher than lake input ratios, suggesting preferential P retention in lakes. This is consistent with the notion that P-limited lakes can exist adjacent to N-limited forests.
1468658| Some aspects of nutrient status and dynamics prevailing during low and high water conditions in the fringing floodplain ponds of the Paran River dominated by the floating macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes are described. During summertime low water conditions, low DIN:DRP ratios (0.16-1.0) and low DIN (0.5-4.8  mol.liter<sup>-1</sup>) in the root-zone of the floating meadows suggest that macrophyte growth is limited by nitrogen DRP concentrations appear to be controlled more by abiotic sorption-dissolution than by biological reactions. Preflood nutrient fluxes from the sediments, as estimated from porewater profiles, show that a minimum of 1.19 and 0.38 mmol.m<sup>-2</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup> of DIN and DRP were regenerated from the sediments, respectively. Heterotrophic N<sub>2</sub> fixation is primarily associated with decaying litter (0.4 to 3.2  molN<sub>2</sub>.g<sup>-1</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>). Nutrient recycling from sediments and meadow-litter, and heterotrophic N<sub>2</sub> fixation (1.4 mmolN.m<sup>-2</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>) appear sufficient to sustain high floating macrophyte productivity for long periods of time, without invoking large inputs from the river. The high water and early isolation periods are characterized by a very dynamic behavior of DIN, reflecting marked imbalances between N supply and demand by the biota. After hydrologic isolation of the ponds, DIN rapidly decreases to undetectable levels and stays low for the following 3 weeks, presumably as a result of high demand by phytoplankton and sediment bacteria. DIN increases again to high values 3-8 weeks after the flood, following the re-establishment of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> fluxes from the sediments. Compared to DIN, DRP concentrations remain relatively high and change little during and after the flood. Because of their small amplitude and short duration, floods do not appear to stimulate floating macrophyte production in the Paran. 
40647927|Denitrification is known as an important pathway for nitrate loss in agroecosystems. It is important to estimate denitrification fluxes to close field and watershed N mass balances, determine greenhouse gas emissions (NO), and help constrain estimates of other major N fluxes (e.g., nitrate leaching, mineralization, nitrification). We compared predicted denitrification estimates for a typical corn and soybean agroecosystem on a tile drained Mollisol from five models (DAYCENT, SWAT, EPIC, DRAINMOD-N II and two versions of DNDC, 82a and 82h), after first calibrating each model to crop yields, water flux, and nitrate leaching. Known annual crop yields and daily flux values (water, nitrate-N) for 1993-2006 were provided, along with daily environmental variables (air temperature, precipitation) and soil characteristics. Measured denitrification fluxes were not available. Model output for 1997-2006 was then compared for a range of annual, monthly and daily fluxes. Each model was able to estimate corn and soybean yields accurately, and most did well in estimating riverine water and nitrate-N fluxes (1997-2006 mean measured nitrate-N loss 28 kg N ha1 year1 , model range 21-28 kg N ha1 year1). Monthly patterns in observed riverine nitrate-N flux were generally reflected in model output (r values ranged from 0.51 to 0.76). Nitrogen fluxes that did not have corresponding measurements were quite variable across the models, including 10-year average denitrification estimates, ranging from 3.8 to 21 kg N ha1 year1 and substantial variability in simulated soybean N fixation, N harvest, and the change in soil organic N pools. DNDC82a and DAYCENT gave comparatively low estimates of total denitrification flux (3.8 and 5.6 kg N ha1 year1, respectively) with similar patterns controlled primarily by moisture. DNDC82h predicted similar fluxes until 2003, when estimates were abruptly much greater. SWAT and DRAINMOD predicted larger denitrification fluxes (about 17-18 kg N ha1 year1) with monthly values that were similar. EPIC denitrification was intermediate between all models (11 kg N ha1 year1). Predicted daily fluxes during a high precipitation year (2002) varied considerably among models regardless of whether the models had comparable annual fluxes for the years. Some models predicted large denitrification fluxes for a few days, whereas others predicted large fluxes persisting for several weeks to months. Modeled denitrification fluxes were controlled mainly by soil moisture status and nitrate available to be denitrified, and the way denitrification in each model responded to moisture status greatly determined the flux. Because denitrification is dependent on the amount of nitrate available at any given time, modeled differences in other components of the N cycle (e.g., N fixation, N harvest, change in soil N storage) no doubt led to differences in predicted denitrification. Model comparisons suggest our ability to accurately predict denitrification fluxes (without known values) from the dominant agroecosystem in the midwestern Illinois is quite uncertain at this time.
1469504|In order to elucidate the effects of rice plants on CH<sub>4</sub> production, we conducted experiments with soil slurries and planted rice microcosms. Methane production in anoxic paddy soil slurries was stimulated by the addition of rice straw, of unsterile or autoclaved rice roots, and of the culture fluid in which rice plants had axenically been cultivated. The addition of these compounds also increased the concentrations of acetate and H<sub>2</sub>, precursors of CH<sub>4</sub> production, in the soil. Planted compared to unplanted paddy soil microcosms exhibited lower porewater CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations but higher CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates. They also exhibited higher sulfate concentrations but similar nitrate concentrations. Concentrations of acetate, lactate and H<sub>2</sub> were not much different between planted and unplanted microcosms. Pulse labeling of rice plants with <sup>14</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> resulted during the next 5 days in transient accumulation of radioactive lactate, propionate and acetate, and after the second day of incubation in the emission of <sup>14</sup>CH<sub>4</sub>. Most of the radioactivity (40-70%) was incorporated into the above-ground biomass of rice plants. However, during a total incubation of 16 days about 3-6% of the applied radioactivity was emitted as <sup>14</sup>CH<sub>4</sub>, demonstrating that plant-derived carbon was metabolized and significantly contributed to CH<sub>4</sub> production. The sequence of the appearance of radioactive products and their specific radioactivities indicate that CH<sub>4</sub> was produced from root exudates by a microbial community consisting of fermenting and methanogenic bacteria.
1469746|Rains at the end of the dry season can trigger increases in emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide from forest and pasture soils in the Amazon Basin. The relative importance of the rain-stimulated emissions in the seasonal and annual budgets of these nitrogen gases for forests and pastures in the western Amazon is not well established. We measured soil emissions of NO and N<sub>2</sub>O from a forest and two pastures, 11 and 26 years old, after a simulated rain event. Wetting the soil resulted in very small pulses of NO or N<sub>2</sub>O from forest soils and no significant NO or N<sub>2</sub>O pulses from the pastures. We estimated that in the forest, the amounts of each gas emitted from pulses during the dry to wet transition period represented 3.4% of the NO and 1.8% of the N<sub>2</sub>O dry-season emissions, but amounted to less than 2% of the annual emissions of either gas. Total N oxide emissions of 5.6 kg N/ha/yr from the forest were nearly evenly divided between NO (42%) and N<sub>2</sub>O (58%). The emissions of NO were evenly distributed over the wet and dry seasons, while over 84% N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes occurred during the wet season.
40647940|To provide a reference for wetlands elsewhere we analysed soil nutrients and the vegetation of floodplains and fens in the relatively undisturbed Biebrza-valley, Poland. Additionally, by studying sites along a water-table gradient, and by comparing pairs of mown and unmown sites, we aimed with exploring long-term effects of drainage and annual hay-removal on nutrient availabilities and vegetation response. In undrained fens and floodplains, N mineralization went slowly (0-30 kg N ha year) but it increased strongly with decreasing water table (up to 120 kg N ha year). Soil N, P and K pools were small in the undisturbed mires. Drainage had caused a shift from fen to meadow species and the disappearance of bryophytes. Biomass of vascular plants increased with increasing N mineralization and soil P. Annual hayremoval tended to have reduced N mineralization and soil pools, but it had increased soil P. Moreover, N concentrations in vascular plants were not affected, but P and K concentrations and therefore N:P and N:K ratios tended to be changed. Annual hay-removal had induced a shift from P to N limitation in the severely drained fen, and from P to N limitation in the floodplain. The low nutrient availabilities and productivity of the undisturbed Biebrza mires illustrate the vulnerability of such mires to eutrophication in Poland and elsewhere. In nutrient-enriched areas, hay removal may prevent productivity increase of the vegetation, but also may severely alter N:P:K stoichiometry, induce K-limitation at drained sites, and alter vegetation structure and composition.
41410548|To better understand the transfer of particulate organic matter (POM) by small mountainous river systems (SMRS) to the ocean, we measured the concentration and composition of suspended particles from the Alsea River, a SMRS in the Oregon Coast Range, over a wide range of discharges that included several floods. All particulate constituents measured, including organic carbon, nitrogen and biomarkers such as lignin-derived phenols, cutin acids and amino acid-derived products, displayed concentrations that increased as a power function of discharge. In contrast to other SMRS, virtually all POM in the Alsea River samples was modern and had an average age < 60 year. In spite of their similar C ages, marked contrasts in elemental and biomarker compositions were evident in particles collected at low and high discharges. Particles at low flows were primarily composed of organic detritus from non-vegetation sources (e. g., algal cells) whereas mineral-rich particles containing vegetation and soil-derived POM were predominant at elevated flows. Biomarker compositions of these latter particles suggest most of the POM originated from areas if the watershed with measurable hardwood contributions, which include areas affected by shallow landslides and riparian zones. We infer that the low uplift rates, lush vegetation, high net primary production and relatively thick soils that characterize the Alsea watershed are responsible for these trends. Comparison of our results with those from other systems, including the well-studied Santa Clara River (southern California), demonstrates that SMRS are part of a continuum whereby contrasts in hydroclimate, geology and vegetation lead to significant differences in the age and composition of POM exported to the ocean.
1469667|The major proportion of heterotrophic activity in running waters is localized on the solid surfaces of sediments in the benthic and hyporheic zone and is dominated by microorganisms. However, this assertion is based on the studies of small streams, and little is known about the microbial metabolism of organic matter in river ecosystems. We therefore explored the relationships between bacterial abundance and production and the gradients of organic matter quality and quantity in sediments of a sixth-order lowland river (Spree, Germany). We found vertical gradients of detrital variables (particulate organic matter (POM), particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PN), and protein) and of bacterial variables (abundance, production, turnover time, and proportion of bacterial carbon in total POC) in two different sediment types. These gradients were steeper in stratified sediments than in the shifting sediments. Detrital variables correlated strongly with bacterial abundance and production. The best correlation was found for detrital variables indicating substrate quantity and quality (r<sub>s</sub>=0.90 for PN with abundance). Although bacterial biomass comprised only 0.7% of the POC (1.9% of PN, 3.4% of the protein) in sediments, the turnover of sedimentary organic carbon was fast (median = 62 d), especially in the shifting sediments. Our findings demonstrate that sediment dynamics significantly foster organic carbon metabolism in river systems. Thus, these sediments, which are typical for lowland rivers, strongly influence the metabolism of the whole ecosystem.
20456497|The role of secondary vegetation in restoring soil fertility during shifting cultivation in the tropics is well known. Yet the effect of secondary succession on the spatial patterns of soil properties has received little attention. To determine whether changes in the plant community as a result of shifting cultivation affect the scale of spatial dependence for biologically important soil nutrients, we sampled three dry tropical forest stands in Campeche, Mexico. These stands represented a gradient of cultivation history: one mature forest stand, a forest fallow that had undergone one cultivation-fallow cycle, and a forest fallow that had undergone two cultivation-fallow cycles. We used an analysis of semivariance to quantify the scale and magnitude of spatial dependence for organic matter content (OM), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and aluminum (Al) in each stand. The scale of spatial dependence varied with cultivation history, but the degree of spatial dependence did not differ among stands. In the mature forest P and K were autocorrelated over distances &gt;7.5 m. In the forest fallows 48-88% of the variation in soil P and K was autocorrelated over distances up to 1.1-5.1 m. In contrast, the range of autocorrelation for Al (2.5 m) did not differ among stands. We conclude that shifting cultivation changes the range of autocorrelation for biologically important soil nutrients at a scale that may influence plant growth. The finer scaled pattern of soil nutrients in forest fallows is likely to persist with continued shifting cultivation, since fallows are cleared every 3-15 years.
24715201|Rice is staple food of half of mankind and paddy soils account for the largest anthropogenic wetlands on earth. Ample of research is being done to find cultivation methods under which the integrative greenhouse effect caused by emitted CH and NO would be mitigated. Whereas most of the research focuses on quantifying such emissions, there is a lack of studies on the biogeochemistry of paddy soils. In order to deepen our mechanistic understanding of NO and CH fluxes in rice paddies, we also determined NO and NO concentrations as well as NO isotope abundances and presence of O along soil profiles of paddies which underwent three different water managements during the rice growing season(s) in (2010 and) 2011 in Korea. Largest amounts of NO (2 mmol m) and CH (14.5 mol m) degassed from the continuously flooded paddy, while paddies with less flooding showed 3060 % less CH emissions and very low to negative NO balances. In accordance, the global warming potential (GWP) was lowest for the Intermittent Irrigation paddy and highest for the Traditional Irrigation paddy. The NO emissions could the best be explained (*P < 0.05) with the N values and NO concentrations in 4050 cm soil depth, implying that major NO production/consumption occurs there. No significant effect of NO on NO production has been found. Our study gives insight into the soil of a rice paddy and reveals areas along the soil profile where NO is being produced. Thereby it contributes to our understanding of subsoil processes of paddy soils.
1469694|Watersheds of the US Geological Survey's Hydrologic Benchmark Network program were used in estimating annual yield of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions (ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic N, particulate N) in relation to amount of runoff, elevation, and watershed area. Only watersheds minimally disturbed with respect to the nitrogen cycle were used in the analysis (mostly natural vegetation cover, no point sources of N, atmospheric deposition of inorganic N < 10 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup>). Statistical analysis of the yields of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions showed that elevation and watershed area bear no significant relationship to nitrogen yield for these watersheds. The yields of total nitrogen and nitrogen fractions are, however, strongly related to runoff (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.91 for total N). Annual yield increases as runoff increases, but at a rate lower than runoff; annual discharge-weighted mean concentrations decline as annual runoff increases. Yields of total nitrogen and most nitrogen fractions bear a relationship to runoff that is nearly indistinguishable from a relationship that was documented previously for minimally disturbed watersheds of the American tropics. Overall, the results suggest strong interlatitudinal convergence of yields and percent fractionation for nitrogen in relation to runoff.
1469610|To evaluate whether rates of weathering of primary minerals are underestimated in watershed mass-balance studies that fail to include products of weathering accumulating in plants and in developing soil, changes in the calcium and magnesium content of vegetation and soil fractions were measured in large, monitored lysimeters (sandbox ecosystems) at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Weathering was evaluated over 4-8 yr in sandboxes planted with red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and kept mostly free of vegetation (nonvegetated). Three mass-balance equations were used that cumulatively include (a) Ca and Mg in precipitation inputs and drainage outputs, (b) accumulation of Ca and Mg in vegetation, and (c) changes in products of weathering in soils. Soil products were evaluated with an extraction process designed to avoid removing ions from primary minerals. Relative to the input-output equation, the estimated rate of weathering increased 2.4 (Ca) and 1.8 (Mg) times when accumulation of Ca and Mg in pine biomass was accounted for, and 8 (Ca) and 23 (Mg) times when changes in soil products were also included. Weathering estimates that included accumulation in vegetation and soil products were 261 (Ca) and 92 (Mg) kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the pine sandbox. These rates were 10 (Ca) and 18 (Mg) times higher than the rates in the nonvegetated sandbox, which were not significantly greater than zero. This study raises the possibility that weathering can play a significant role in the release of nutrients available to plants over short periods. Faster rates like this become extremely important where managers are trying to balance nutrients available to plants from precipitation and weathering release with outputs including harvest removals.
1468597|There is considerable interest in the chemistry of Mn in acidic waters because of its role in the generation of acid neutralizing capacity during reduction processes, as an adsorbent in element cycling, and as a potential toxicant to aquatic organisms. Temporal and spatial variations in the concentration of Mn were evident in acidic Dart's Lake (1.0-2.3  mol l<sup>-1</sup>), located in the Adirondack Region of New York. Seasonal changes in pH and dissolved oxygen concentration had subtle effects on the chemistry and transport of Mn. Despite oversaturation with respect to the solubility of manganite during periods of stratification, vertical deposition of Mn was minimal. The conservative nature of Mn appears to be due to the acidic conditions in Dart's Lake.
25652590|Like many other coastal systems across the world, the Coorong lagoonal ecosystem (South Australia) has degraded over the last 100 years; in this case as a result of extensive regulation and diversions of water across the Murray-Darling Basin following European settlement. To evaluate whether the sources of organic matter (OM) supporting its food-web have changed since the inception of water management and barrage construction, sedimentary OM was characterised in cores spanning the Coorong's salinity gradient at depths representative of the last 100 years over which the management alterations to river and estuarine flow were most marked. Detailed Pb, Cs and Pu dating in conjunction with palaeolimnological data (Pinus pollen) allowed for the reconstruction of the timing of substantial changes observed in the composition of the OM, most of which occur during the early 1950s, concurrent with management-related variations in water flow and salinity. Negative shifts in C of up to 8.3 in the 210 and <2 m fractions after the 1950s suggest a pronounced alteration in biogeochemical cycling or in the origin of OM. Elemental ratios and C values of potential sources are inconclusive as to the cause of these biogeochemical changes. However, C-NMR spectra of the sediments suggest that degraded phytoplankton constitutes a large proportion of today's OM and also reveal that an OM source rich in lignin was present prior to the 1950s. The high C (-18.3) and low C/N (7.5) signatures of the lignin-bearing sediments are inconsistent with a C3 terrestrial OM source and instead suggest that the lignin-bearing seagrass Ruppia megacarpa (C of -13) contributed to a large degree to the sediment of the North Lagoon. R. megacarpa once was abundant in the North Lagoon but today has all but vanished from the system. Thus, only through a combination of isotopic and spectroscopic techniques was it possible to effectively decipher the changes in the composition of OM deposited throughout the Coorong over space and time. These results have important implications for research in estuarine OM dynamics in other geographic locations. Specifically, utilising complementary analytical techniques may sometimes be essential in reliably determining OM sources and processes in estuaries and lagoons.
40343520|The composition and biodegradability of streamwater dissolved organic matter (DOM) varies with source material and degree of transformation. We combined PARAFAC modeling of fluorescence excitation-emission spectroscopy and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations to investigate seasonal changes in the lability of DOM along a soil-stream continuum in three soil types: bog, forested wetland and upland forest. The percent BDOC ranged from 7 to 38% across all sites, and was significantly greater in soil compared to streamwater in the bog and forested wetland, but not in the upland forest. The percent BDOC also varied significantly over the entire sampling period in soil and streamwater for the bog and forested wetland, as BDOC peaked during the spring runoff and was lowest during the summer months. Moreover, the chemical quality of DOM in wetland soil and streamwater was similar during the spring runoff and fall wet season, as demonstrated by the similar contribution of protein-like fluorescence (sum of tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence) in soil water and in streams. These findings suggest that the tight coupling between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is responsible for the delivery of labile DOM from wetland soils to streams. The contribution of protein-like fluorescence was significantly correlated with BDOC (p < 0.001) over the entire sampling period indicating DOM is an important source of C and N for heterotrophic microbes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the production of protein-rich, labile DOM and subsequent loss in stream runoff might be an important loss of labile C and N from coastal temperate watersheds.
1469410|Nutrient availability limits plant production across a wide range of terrestrial ecosystems. In this study of a Californian annual grassland community, the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations on plant nutrient acquisition was investigated using factorial combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and benomyl fungicide. N additions resulted in a significant increase in shoot biomass demonstrating that plant productivity in these soils was N-limited. The effect of P additions consistently depended on fungicide treatment. In the absence of benomyl, shoot P accumulation was unaltered by P addition. In the presence of benomyl, P addition significantly increased shoot P accumulation and was associated with a consistent trend towards enhanced shoot biomass. The induction of P-deficiency with benomyl application suggests that effective P acquisition by AM may contribute to the strong N-limitation of production observed in many terrestrial ecosystems.
1468735|Soil nitrogen mineralisation and nitrification potentials, and soil solution chemistry were measured in black locust (Robinia pseudo-acacia L.), in pine-mixed hardwood stands on an early successional watershed (WS6), and in an older growth oak-hickory forest located on an adjacent, mixed hardwood watershed (WS14) at Coweeta Hydrologic laboratory, in the southern Appalachian mountains, U.S.A. Nitrification potentials were higher in black locust and pine-mixed hardwood early successional stands than in the oak-hickory forest of the older growth watershed. Ammonification rates were the main factor controlling nitrification in the early successional stands. There was no evidence of inhibition of nitrification in soils from the older growth oak-hickory forest site. Within the early successional watershed, black locust sites had net mineralisation and nitrification rates at least twice as high as those in the pine mixed-hardwood stands. Concentrations of exchangeable nitrate in the soil of black locust stands were higher than in pine-mixed hardwoods at 0-15 cm in March and they were also higher at 0-15, 16-30 and 31-45 cm depth in the black locust dominated sites in July. Soil solution nitrate concentrations were higher under black locust than under pine-mixed hardwoods. Areas dominated by the nitrogen fixing black locust had greater nitrogen mineralisation and nitrification rates, resulting in higher potential for leaching losses of nitrate from the soil column in the early successional watershed.
1469909|Sources, sinks, and distribution patterns of volatile halogenated organic compounds (VHOC) in estuaries were investigated during 5 cruises within the BIOGEST programme. Due to their chemical and physical properties (e.g. toxicity, persistence, mobility) these compounds are of considerable environmental concern. A wide range of compounds has been identified and quantified generally ranging from 0.1 ng l<sup>-1</sup> to 350 ng l<sup>-1</sup>. In some samples extraordinarily high values up to 4700 ng l<sup>-1</sup> were observed indicating contribution from anthropogenic sources. Generally, concentrations of halogenated compounds of anthropogenic origin dominated those of prevalent natural origin. Data of selected VHOC are presented in relation to salinity, particular organic carbon, and total suspended matter. Furthermore the observed concentrations are compared with established water quality regulations. Distribution patterns of VHOC along the estuary indicated common sources for specific halogenated compounds. Decreasing concentrations of most VHOC along the estuary confirm that degassing to the atmosphere and dilution with sea water are the dominating processes controlling the fate of these compounds in estuaries.
20055270|The growth of forest species in soil development chronosequences becomes increasingly phosphorus (P)-limited with time, as P is weathered, eroded and leached from soil. Foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations also tend to decrease with soil age when vegetation may be limited in both N and P. Here we report on soil development in temperate rain forests along three New Zealand chronosequences that have minimal pollution and disturbance from human activities, at Franz Josef, Waitutu and Central Volcanic Plateau, and on factors influencing soil net N mineralization (aerobic; 56 days) and foliar N and P concentrations. Except in very young soils (&lt 500 years), at least 85% of total-P in mineral soil (0-10 cm) was transformed to organic-P. In each chronosequence, total-P declined with time, and foliar N:P ratios (mass) generally increased from 8 to 15-18, suggesting P was more limiting than N in the oldest soils of the chronosequence. There was a negative relationship between net N mineralization and C:N ratio for mineral soil. For the FH (organic) layer, net N mineralization had the strongest relationships with total-N concentration (positively) and C:organic-P ratio (negatively); however, relationships varied with forest group, suggesting that other factors were also important. Foliar P of kamahi (Weinmannia racemosa Linn. f.), a dominant canopy species, was related to soil organic-P, suggesting mineralization was an important process for tree nutrition. Foliar N was positively related to N concentration in the FH layer, but was not significantly related to any measured property in mineral soil, possibly because of the wide range of soils. The consistent declines in both soil and foliar P across the contrasting chronosequences strongly suggest that vegetation becomes progressively P-limited during long-term ecosystem development.
40647941|In arctic and alpine ecosystems, soil nitrogen (N) dynamics can differ markedly between winter and summer months, and nitrogen losses can be measurable during the spring and fall transitions. To explore the effect of seasonality on biogeochemical processes in a temperate alpine environment, we used a combination of field incubations (year-round) and N tracer additions (late fall, early spring, summer) to characterize soil N dynamics in a wet and dry meadow in the Sierra Nevada, California. The snowmelt to early summer season marked a period of high N uptake and turnover in the two soils, coincident with the increase in microbial N pools at the start of snowmelt (wet and dry meadow); an increase in net N mineralization and net nitrification as snowmelt progressed (wet meadow only); and measureable net production of N-NH in mid-summer (wet and dry meadow). Whereas fluctuations in microbial biomass were generally synchronous between the wet and dry meadow soils, only wet meadow soils appeared to mineralize N in response to declines in the microbial N pool. Net N mineralization and net nitrification rates in the dry meadow soil were negligible on all but one sampling date, in spite of periodic decreases in biomass of up to 60%. Across both sites, high N recoveries in microbial biomass N, rapid N-NH turnover, and low or negative net N-NH fluxes suggested tight cycling of N, particularly in the late fall and early spring.
1469885| Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into Cockburn Sound Western Australia was quantified by applying a distributed groundwater flow model to estimate the inshore aquifer water balance. Spatially averaged SGD along the coast was estimated to be 2.5-4.8  0.9 m<sup>3</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>. The range in estimated average SGD reflected low and high estimates of average groundwater recharge, which ranged from 0.13 to 0.24 m year<sup>-1</sup> (15-28% of average annual rainfall). The error  0.9 m<sup>3</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> was calculated by assuming arbitrary 20% errors in groundwater pumping and inflow across boundaries. SGD varied spatially along the coastal boundary due to variation in hydraulic connection between the coastal aquifers and ocean, and spatial variability in recharge, transmissivity and pumping. Under assumptions of low and high groundwater recharge, SGD along the coastline varied in the ranges 1.4-4.6 m<sup>3</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> and 2.4-7.9 m<sup>3</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. 
1469443|Forested watersheds are an important part of the terrestrial mercury and methylmercury cycle, and a link between the atmospheric and aquatic environment. This study was conducted to determine the contribution of the forest floor to the pools and fluxes of total Hg (Hg<sub>total</sub>) and methylmercury (MeHg) in a forested catchment, and to identify factors influencing the mobility of both compounds. Throughfall deposition, litterfall, runoff and fluxes with forest floor percolate of Hg<sub>total</sub> and MeHg were sampled during one year in a coniferous catchment in Germany. Total deposition of Hg<sub>total</sub> was 552 mg ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup> with litterfall contributing one third. Nearly 60% of the total input of Hg<sub>total</sub> reached the mineral soil with the forest floor percolate, but less than half of this fraction was found in the runoff of the catchment. Total deposition of MeHg was 2.6 mg ha<sup>-1</sup> a<sup>-1</sup>, with litterfall as the dominating pathway. Only 19% of the MeHg deposition was discharged from the forest floor, but the flux of MeHg with runoff was nearly twice as high. Only few correlations with other solution parameters were found. Fluxes of both compounds with forest floor percolates depended mainly on water fluxes, which was not true for the runoff. The forest floor of the upland soil is an effective sink for MeHg, but not for Hg<sub>total</sub>. Differences in the mobility of both compounds in the forest floor disappeared at the catchment scale, probably because other processes (i.e. Hg<sub>total</sub> immobilization and MeHg formation) dominated.
1468546| Methane emission rates from an Italian rice paddy field showed diel and seasonal variations. The seasonal variations were not closely related to soil temperatures. However, the diel changes of CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes were significantly correlated with the diel changes of the temperature in a particular soil depth. The soil depths with the best correlations between CH<sub>4</sub> flux and temperature were shallow (1-5 cm) in May and June, deep (10-15 cm) in June and July, and again shallow (1-5 cm) in August. Apparent activation energies (E<sub>a</sub>) calculated from these correlations using the Arrhenius model were relatively low (50-150 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) in May and June, but increased to higher values (80-450 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>) in August. In the laboratory, CH<sub>4</sub> emission from two rice cultures incubated at temperatures between 20 and 38C showed E<sub>a</sub> values of 41 and 53 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. Methane production in anoxic paddy soil suspensions incubated between 7 and 43C showed E<sub>a</sub> values between 53 and 132 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> with an average value of 85 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, and in pure cultures of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic bacteria E<sub>a</sub> values between 77 and 173 (average 126) kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. It is suggested that diel changes of soil properties other than temperature affect CH<sub>4</sub> emission rates, e.g. diel changes in root exudation or in efficiency of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation in the rhizosphere. 
23359713|Production of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) from marine samples is often quantified using gas chromatography techniques. Typically, these are labour intensive and have a slow sample turnover rate. Here we demonstrate the use of a portable fast DMS sensor (FDS) that utilises the chemiluminescent reaction of DMS and ozone to measure DMS production in aqueous samples, with a maximum frequency of 10 Hz. We have developed a protocol for quantifying DMS production that removes potential signal interference from other biogenic trace gases such as isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) and hydrogen sulfide. The detection limit was 0.89 pM (0.02 ppbv) when using a DMS standard gas mixture. The lowest DMS production rates quantified with the FDS and verified using conventional gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD) were around 0.01 nmol min -1 . There was a strong correlation in DMS production when comparing the FDS and GC-FPD techniques with a range of marine samples (e.g., r 2 = 0.94 for Emiliania huxleyi). However, the combined dataset showed the FDS measured 22% higher DMS production than the GC-FPD, with the differences in rates likely due to interfering gases, for example hydrogen sulfide and isoprene. This possible overestimation of DMS production is smaller than the two-fold difference in DMS production between day and night samples from a culture of E. huxleyi. The response time of the instrument to changes in DMS production is method dependent (e.g., geometry of incubation vessel, bubble size) and was approximately 4 min under our conditions when using a culture of E. huxleyi (800 ml) with aeration at 100 ml min -1 . We suggest the FDS can reduce sample handling, is suitable for short- and long-term measurements of DMS production in algal cultures, and will widen the range of DMS research in marine environments.
4151481|The organic matter extracted from various mineral horizons of two forest soils, one under silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), the other under European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), was fractionated by dialysis into three fractions, 100-1000, 1000-8000, and >8000Da. On a C basis, in all horizons the recovered organic matter amounted to less than a half of the total and was mainly composed of molecules >8000 Da. The 100-1000 Da fraction had a principal elemental composition profoundly different from the other two fractions, which, instead differed from each other significantly only for the S content and the molar ratio of C with N. No significant difference in this regard was found between soils. The richness in O and some typical absorption bands in the FT-IR spectra indicated that the 100-1000 Da fraction had a lot of carboxyl groups. The spectroscopic (
41410559|In this study we characterized spatial heterogeneity of soil carbon and nitrogen pools, soil moisture, and soil pH of the first 15 cm of the soil profile; depth of the organic horizon; forest floor covers; and understory vegetation abundances in three sites (1999, 1987 and 1920 wildfires) of a boreal forest chronosequence of interior Alaska. We also investigated the cross-dependence between understory vegetation distribution and soil characteristics. Our results showed higher microbial respiration rates and microbial biomass in the oldest site and greater net N mineralization rates in the mid-successional site. Although spatial heterogeneity was absent at the scale studied for the majority of soil variables (60%), understory vegetation abundances and forest floor cover, spatial heterogeneity decreased with time after fire for the depth of organic horizon, soil microbial biomass, N mineralization rates and feathermoss cover. Our results also showed that increasing time after fire decreased the number of correlations between understory vegetation and soil characteristics while it increased between forest floor covers and soil characteristics. Overall, our study suggest that fire initially creates a patchy mosaic of forest floor cover, from fire hot spots, where high intensity burning exposes mineral soil, to practically unburned areas with intact mosses and lichens. As time since fire passes, forest floor cover and soil characteristics tend to become more uniform as understory species fill in severely burned areas. burning exposes mineral soil, to practically unburned areas with intact mosses and lichens.

1469463| Soil columns with O + A (Experiment I) or O horizons (Experiment II) from a Haplic Podsol were incubated at 15 C for 368 and 29 + 106 days, respectively. Three types of liming material differing in Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, i.e. calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), dolomite (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) and magnesium carbonate (MgCO<sub>3</sub>), were mixed into the O horizons in equimolar amounts corresponding to 6000 kg of (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) per ha. In the limed treatments of Experiment I, the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the net sulphur mineralization (estimated as accumulated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> leaching corrected for changes in the soil pools of adsorbed and water extractable SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) increased with decreasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> content of the lime and increasing degree of lime dissolution. In relation to the control treatment, only the MgCO<sub>3</sub> treatment resulted in a significantly higher net sulphur mineralization. In Experiment I the net sulphur mineralization was 4.06, 1.68 0.57, and 2.14 mg S in the MgCO<sub>3</sub>, CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, CaCO<sub>3</sub> and control treatment, respectively. The accumulated SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> leaching in Experiment II during the first 29 days was 1.70, 0.74 and 0.48 mg S in the MgCO<sub>3</sub>, CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and control treatment, respectively. In the two experiments there were consistently significant positive correlations between leached amounts of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> and DOC. It was concluded that net sulphur mineralization was strongly connected to the solubilization of the organic matter (DOC formation) and that pH and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions affected the net sulphur mineralization through their effects on organic matter solubility. 
1469594|Terrestrial ecosystems with their main elements soil and plants may act, in principle, as both source and sink for atmospheric nitric oxide (NO). The net exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere, however, is globally dominated by biogenic emissions of NO from soils. Consequently the soil-air exchange of NO is the focus of the following overview. Particular emphasis is placed on the major processes that are responsible for NO production in soils (nitrification, denitrification) and their regulation by environmental factors (nitrogen availability, soil water content, soil temperature, ambient NO concentration). It is shown that interactions of these factors are a major reason for the broad range that exists in published data on NO fluxes. This variability makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of NO fluxes on relevant spatial and temporal scales. To overcome the problem various generalization procedures for scaling up in space and time have been developed, and the potential and limitations of the different approaches is discussed.
1468646|We estimated whole-ecosystem rates of respiration over a 40-km stretch of the tidally influenced freshwater Hudson River every 2 to 3 weeks from May through November. We measured in situ concentrations of oxygen over depth at dusk and dawn at 10 stations spaced over this interval. The use of multiple stations allowed for the consideration of the influence of tidal advection of water masses. Respiration was estimated from the decrease in oxygen overnight with a correction for diffusive exchange of oxygen with the atmosphere. We estimated this flux of oxygen to or from the atmosphere using the measured oxygen gradient and a transfer velocity model which is a function of wind velocity. Integration of the data for the period of May through November yields an estimate of whole-ecosystem respiration of 591 g C m<sup>-2</sup> (S.E. = 66). That the standard error of this estimate is relatively low (11% of the estimate) indicates that the use of multiple stations adequately deals with error introduced through the advection of water between stations. The logarithm of average daily respiration rate was correlated with average daily temperature (p = 0.007; r<sup>2</sup>=0.62). We used this temperature-respiration relationship to derive an estimate of the annual respiration rate of 755 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (S.E. = 72). This estimate is moderately sensitive to the estimated flux of oxygen between the atmosphere and water; using the lower and upper 95% confidence limits of our model relating the transfer velocity of oxygen to wind speed gives a range of annual respiration estimates from 665 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> to 984 g C m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. The river is strongly heterotrophic, with most respiration driven by allochthonous inputs of organic matter from terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of the allochthonous inputs to the river (over 60%) are apparently metabolized within the river. Any change in allochthonous inputs due to changes in land use or climate patterns would be expected to alter the oxygen dynamics and energy flow within this tidally influenced river.
20055243|Sediment in the littoral zone of lakes is frequently disturbed by wave action or bioturbation, resulting in sediment resuspension. In undisturbed sediment, methanotrophic bacteria efficiently reduce the diffusive flux of methane into the water column. In a microcosm study, the resuspension of littoral sediment was simulated in sediment cores for a winter (n = 3) and a summer situation (n = 3). The erosion of surface sediment resulted in a large flux of methane into the overlying water (207  176 mol
40343551|We evaluated nitrogen (N) export for various catchments in the San Pedro River watershed of South-central Chile (3920' to 4012'S) during the dry season (February to March). We measured concentrations and export of the various N species at 16 points from the Andean headwaters to the lowland portion of the watershed: eight main nested points along the main watershed and eight secondary points on tributaries. We expected that, given a downstream increase in pastureland and decrease in native pristine forest cover, inorganic forms of N (DIN) would increase downstream, while conversely, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) would decrease compared with concentrations in the forested headwaters. Nitrogen concentrations did not show statistically significant differences among the nested catchments. However, there were statistically significant differences in N concentrations associated with land cover among the tributaries. The results suggest that in the presence of base flow, natural landscape properties (barren land, lakes and rivers), explained most of the spatial variation in the N exports, while anthropogenic disturbance was not detectable. There was a negative relationship between DIN export and the coverage of lakes and rivers, suggesting that lakes might be acting as N traps. On the other hand, DIN, DON and total N exports were positively associated to barren land. Total nitrogen export during this 60-day dry season was less than 20 kg km and the annual export was not larger than 100 kg km. This study documents the as yet pristine conditions of rivers in southern Chile.
1469921|Wetlands across the Canadian prairies are typically shallow (<1.0 m) and exhibit high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (>10 mg l<sup>-1</sup>). Studies have shown that DOC in such shallow wetlands is not as reliable an indicator of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) attenuation as it is in clearwater. Changes in DOC character and composition as a result of sunlight exposure might provide a reasonable explanation for this observation. To test this, we investigated seasonal changes in DOC optical and chemical properties in a shallow prairie wetland over a 2-year period. Although DOC concentration increased at least two-fold from spring until fall, DOC specific absorption (at 350 nm) and fluorescence decreased by 30 and 32%, respectively, for the same period. In both years, seasonal decreases in DOC molecular weight and size (from measurements of tangential filtration and mass electrospray mass spectrometry) were reflected in concomitant increases in spectral slope. <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis of DOC isolated on XAD-8 resins revealed a 49% decrease in aromatic moieties when spring values were compared to those in the fall. As well,  <sup>13</sup>C signatures of this isolated DOC became heavier seasonally. In a short term photodegradation experiment (6 days) we noted a 47% decline in DOC specific absorption coecients at 350 nm and a 15% increase in spectral slope when water exposed to the total light spectrum was compared to that of a dark control. Taken together, all of these observations were consistent with the occurrence of seasonal DOC photodegradation in shallow prairie wetlands and underlined the importance of this process in shaping DOC character and composition in these hydrologically dynamic systems. Our data also indicates that constant mixing and shallow depths in these wetlands were factors which enhanced DOC photodegradation. Although the high DOC concentrations of prairie wetlands should theoretically oer protection for their biota, seasonal photodegradation of DOC means that these systems may not be as protected as their high DOC concentrations suggest.
1468507|A potential effect of climatic change was simulated by manipulating the water table height within intact peat monoliths. The treatment decreased methane flux (maximum -80%) and increased both carbon dioxide flux (maximum 146%) and nitrous oxide flux (maximum 936%). Returning the water table height to its original level caused both nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide flux to rapidly return to control levels. However, methane flux remained at its experimentally induced low levels.
20055191|Soil temperature and moisture influence soil respiration at a range of temporal and spatial scales. Although soil temperature and moisture may be seasonally correlated, intra and inter-annual variations in soil moisture do occur. There are few direct observations of the influence of local variation in species composition or other stand/site characteristics on seasonal and annual variations in soil moisture, and on cumulative annual soil carbon release. Soil climate and soil respiration from twelve sites in five different forest types were monitored over a 2-year period (1998-1999). Also measured were stand age, species composition, basal area, litter inputs, total above-ground wood production, leaf area index, forest floor mass, coarse and fine root mass, forest floor carbon and nitrogen concentration, root carbon and nitrogen concentration, soil carbon and nitrogen concentration, coarse fraction mass and volume, and soil texture. General soil respiration models were developed using soil temperature, daily soil moisture, and various site/soil characteristics. Of the site/soil characteristics, above-ground production, soil texture, roots + forest floor mass, roots + forest floor carbon:nitrogen, and soil carbon:nitrogen were significant predictors of soil respiration when used alone in respiration models; all of these site variables were weakly to moderately correlated with mean site soil moisture. Daily soil climate data were used to estimate the annual release of carbon (C) from soil respiration for the period 1998-1999. Mean annual soil temperature did not differ between the 2 years but mean annual soil moisture was approximately 9% lower in 1998 due to a summer drought. Soil C respired during 1998 ranged from 8.57 to 11.43 Mg C

25652619|The effects of site exposure (microclimate) and forest management (thinning) on fungal-to-bacterial (F:B) respiratory ratio and NO emission from forest floor and Ah layer samples were studied at untreated and thinned beech forests. Microclimate effects were studied by selecting sites facing north-east (NE) or south-west (SW). The F:B respiratory ratio was estimated using substrate-induced respiration in combination with inhibitors either affecting fungi or bacteria. NO production was evaluated after moistening samples initially pre-incubated at different moisture levels to 100% of the water holding capacity (WHC). F:B respiratory ratios were significantly affected by microclimate and thinning, with site exposure having the strongest effect on fungal-to-bacterial ratio and NO production both for the forest floor and the Ah layer. Significantly more NO was produced from soils pre-incubated under low (15% WHC) moisture conditions as compared to soils pre-incubated under air dry (5% WHC) or wet conditions (3060% WHC). A positive correlation between NO emission and F:B respiratory ratio for Ah layer samples and a negative correlation between bacterial substrate induced respiration (SIR) and NO emission for both Ah layer and forest floor samples indicated that net NO production was the result of predominantly fungal NO production and predominantly bacterial NO consumption. The latter hypothesis was further supported by increased NO emission from samples treated with bacterial inhibitor.

20456501|Four whole-lake inorganic C addition experiments were conducted in lakes of differing trophic status. Inorganic C addition enriched algal carbon in C and changed the C-DOC by +1.5 to +9.5, depending on the specific lake. This change in C-DOC represented a significant input of algal DOC that was not completely consumed by bacteria. We modeled the dynamics in C-DOC to estimate the fluxes of algal and terrestrial carbon to and from the DOC pool, and determine the composition of the standing stock. Two experiments in lightly stained, oligotrophic lakes indicated that algal production was the source of about 20% of the DOC pool. In the following year, the experiment was repeated in one of these lakes under conditions of nutrient enrichment, and in a third, more humic lake. Algal contributions to the DOC pool were 40% in the nutrient enriched lake and 5% in the more humic lake. Spectroscopic and elemental analyses corroborated the presence of increased algal DOC in the nutrient enriched lake. Natural abundance measurements of the C of DOC in 32 lakes also revealed the dual contributions of both terrestrial and algal carbon to DOC. From these results, we suggest an approach for inferring the contribution of algal and terrestrial DOC using easily measurable parameters.
20055234|The Nivelle River, a typical Pyrenean mountainous watershed reaching the Bay of Biscay (Atlantic Ocean), was sampled with high resolution during 1996. The particulate organic carbon (POC) contents during successive floods shows that there is a graduated impoverishment of the organic fraction of suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the first flood to the next ones, reaching a threshold value (3%) attributed to allochtonous fraction (soil). On the basis of the high frequency data of water discharge and POC concentration, an annual POC flux was established: 845 tons, corresponding to a specific POC flux of 5.3 tC
24715367|Amino sugar dynamics represent an important but under-investigated component of the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in old-growth Douglas-fir forest soils. Because fungal biomass is high in these soils, particularly in areas colonized by rhizomorphic ectomycorrhizal fungal mats, organic matter derived from chitinous cell wall material (or the monomeric building block of chitin, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)) could be a significant source of C or N to the soil microbiota, and thus an important driver of microbial C and N processing. This paper reports the results of incubation experiments initiated to measure chitin degradation, NAG utilization, and the contribution of these substrates to soil respiration and N mineralization rates in mat-colonized and non-mat soil organic horizons. Amendments of chitin and NAG stimulated respiration, N mineralization, and biomass accumulation in mat and non-mat soils, and responses to NAG amendment were stronger than to chitin amendment. NAG-induced respiration was consistently two-fold higher in mat soils than non-mat soils, but induced N mineralization was similar between the two soil patch types. Assimilation of both C and N into microbial biomass was apparent, biomass C:N ratio decreased in all treatments, and microbial N use efficiency (treatment means 0.25  0.060.50  0.05) was greater than C use efficiency (treatment means 0.12  0.040.32  0.02). NAGase enzyme response was non-linear and showed the same pattern in chitin and NAG amendments. Responses to NAG and chitin amendment differed between mat and nonmat soils, indicating different mechanisms driving NAG and chitin utilization or differences in saprotrophic community composition between the two soil patch types. Net chitin and NAG processing rates were 0.083.4 times the basal respiration rates and 0.0714 times the ambient net N mineralization rates, high enough for the turnover of total soil amino sugars to potentially occur in days to weeks. The results support the hypotheses that amino sugars are important microbial C and N sources and drivers of C and N cycling in these soils.
25652609|In N-polluted, minimally managed soils, recent research has shown that ammonium-N, as well as nitrate-N, may move down through soil profiles. There is a need, therefore, to reassess what controls N species transformations below the rooting depth in such soils. The changes with depth down to 1 m in extractable ammonium-N and nitrate-N concentrations have been studied for two heavily N-impacted acid grassland soils near York, UK, for fresh soils and for soils incubated after either deionised water (d.w.) or ammonium-N spiking. Although in close proximity, the profiles showed marked differences in their relationships of ammonium- and nitrate-N to soil pH, C%, N% and C:N ratio. One profile was slightly more acidic at the surface, which seems to have changed the distribution of organic matter throughout the soil profile. Trends in ammonium production with depth were clearer when ammonium-N concentrations were recalculated on the basis of ammonium-N per unit mass of soil organic C. This then allowed a consistent trend with soil pH to be discerned for both profiles. Ammonium-N spiking showed that ammonium substrate availability was limiting potential net nitrification rate at 2060 cm depth for both profiles. Potential mineral-N production was considerable at depth, which would facilitate transport of N to surface waters and/or groundwaters.
20456483|Seawater concentrations of the climate-cooling, volatile sulphur compound dimethylsulphide (DMS) are the result of numerous production and consumption processes within the marine ecosystem. Due to this complex nature, it is difficult to predict temporal and geographical distribution patterns of DMS concentrations and the inclusion of DMS into global ocean climate models has only been attempted recently. Comparisons between individual model predictions, and ground-truthing exercises revealed that information on the functional relationships between physical and chemical ecosystem parameters, biological productivity and the production and consumption of DMS and its precursor dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) is necessary to further refine future climate models. In this review an attempt is made to quantify these functional relationships. The description of processes includes: (1) parameters controlling DMSP production such as species composition and abiotic factors; (2) the conversion of DMSP to DMS by algal and bacterial enzymes; (3) the fate of DMSP-sulphur due to, e.g., grazing, microbial consumption and sedimentation and (4) factors controlling DMS removal from the water column such as microbial consumption, photo-oxidation and emission to the atmosphere. We recommend the differentiation of six phytoplankton groups for inclusion in future models: eukaryotic and prokaryotic picoplankton, diatoms, dinoflagellates, and other phytoflagellates with and without DMSP-lyase activity. These functional groups are characterised by their cell size, DMSP content, DMSP-lyase activity and interactions with herbivorous grazers. In this review, emphasis is given to ecosystems dominated by the globally relevant haptophytes Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis sp., which are important DMS and DMSP producers.
1469939|Polar dissolved organic matter (DOM) was isolated from a surface-water sample from the Great Salt Lake by separating it from colloidal organic matter by membrane dialysis, from less-polar DOM fractions by resin sorbents, and from inorganic salts by a combination of sodium cation exchange followed by precipitation of sodium salts by acetic acid during evaporative concentration. Polar DOM was the most abundant DOM fraction, accounting for 56% of the isolated DOM. Colloidal organic matter was <sup>14</sup>C-age dated to be about 100% modern carbon and all of the DOM fractions were <sup>14</sup>C-age dated to be between 94 and 95% modern carbon. Average structural models of each DOM fraction were derived that incorporated quantitative elemental and infrared, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, and electrospray/mass spectrometric data. The polar DOM model consisted of open-chain N-acetyl hydroxy carboxylic acids likely derived from N-acetyl heteropolysaccharides that constituted the colloidal organic matter. The less polar DOM fraction models consisted of aliphatic alicyclic ring structures substituted with carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, ester, and methyl groups. These ring structures had characteristics similar to terpenoid precursors. All DOM fractions in the Great Salt Lake are derived from algae and bacteria that dominate DOM inputs in this lake.
1468879|Methane oxidation rates were measured in boreal forest soils using seven techniques that provide a range of information on soil CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation.

Jar experiments with free-air headspaces and soil CH<sub>4</sub> profiles show that CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation occurs to a soil depth of 60 cm and is maximum in the 10 to 20 cm zone. Jar experiments and chamber measurements with free-air headspaces show that CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation occurs at low (<0.9 ppm) thresholds. The <sup>14</sup>CH<sub>4</sub>-amended jar experiments show the distribution of end products of CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation; 60% is transformed to CO<sub>2</sub> and the remainder is incorporated in biomass. Chamber and jar experiments under amended atmospheres show that these soils have a high capacity for CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation and indicate potential CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation rates as high as 867 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Methane oxidation in moist soils modulates CH<sub>4</sub> emission and can serve as a negative feedback on atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> increases.
1468781| In order to study geochemical and biogeochemical processes in estuaries, particularly in the turbidity maximum and at the plume water fronts, two cruises were carried out in the summer and winter of 1988 in the Changjiang Estuary region. The study permitted to identify two major sources of nutrients: firstly the Changjiang River carried abundant nutrients with 90-110 mol/l of Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> 70-95 mol/l of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and 0.5-0.8 mol/l of PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>. The annual average nutrient fluxes of the studied year were estimated as about 2.5 10<sup>12</sup>, 1.0 10<sup>12</sup> and 1.9 10<sup>10</sup> g/yr for Si, N and P, respectively. However, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> did not principally originate from the freshwater discharge. Their distribution was more affected by geochemical and biogeochemical processes. Secondly nutrient release in the turbidity maximum and from sediments outside the plume water fronts was observed. In the regions where vertical convection was strengthened due to the complex hydrographic features of the studied region, nutrients released from sediments dispersed upward to the surface waters providing a basis for an increase of primary productivity. In addition to seawater dilution, biological activities were another important factor for nutrient consumption, particularly outside the plume water fronts where biological consumption led to a noticeable removal of nutrients from surface waters.

1469824|The interaction of rain water with the vegetation canopy results in changes of the water quantity and quality. We examined these canopy effects in different ecosystems of the Brazilian savanna, the Cerrado. The ecosystems were 20 yr-old Pinus caribaea Morelet plantations (PI), productive (PP) and degraded Brachiaria decumbens Stapf pastures (DP), continuous corn-soybean rotation (CC), and native typical cerrado (CE). We collected rainfall, throughfall, and, in PI and CE, stemflow from three plots of each ecosystem. Dry deposition and canopy leaching were estimated with a Na-tracer method. Between May 1997 and April 1999, the mean annual rainfall was 1656 mm of which 145 mm fell during the dry season (May-September). The throughfall percentage of the rainfall increased in the order, PI (75-85%) < CC (76-89%) < CE (89-100%) < PP (90-100%) < DP (99-100%); stemflow was < 1% of the rainfall. The volume-weighted mean (VWM) pH in rainfall was higher in the dry (6.5) than in the rainy season (5.4). The VWM pH in throughfall decreased in the order, CC (rainy season: 5.9/dry season: 6.2) > PP (5.5/6.0) > CE (5.2/6.0) > DP (5.2/5.6) > PI (4.8/5.7). The rainfall deposition of the dry season contributed one third of the annual element input with rainfall because of higher element concentrations than in the rainy season. The mean Na deposition ratios, i.e. the ratio of throughfall (+ stemflow) to rainfall deposition as a measure for dry deposition, increased in the order, CE (1.5) = CC (1.5) < PP (1.7) < PI (1.9) < (DP 2.1). Total deposition (rainfall + dry deposition) accounted for 104-164% of the K and Ca fertilizer application in PP and for 6.1-12% of the K, Ca, and Mg fertilizer application in CC. The P concentrations were below the detection limit of 0.2 mg L<sup>-1</sup> in all samples. Net canopy uptake, i.e. a smaller throughfall(+ stemflow) than rainfall + dry deposition, of Ca, K, Mg, S, Cu, and Zn in at least one of CE, PI, DP, and PP indicate that plant growth may be limited in part by these nutrients. During the vegetation period, between 28 and 50% of the applied K and Ca were leached from the canopy in PP and between 8.7 and 17% of the applied K, Ca, Mg, and S in CC. Our results demonstrate that PI causes larger water losses and enhanced acid inputs to the soil compared with all other ecosystems. However, the PI and pasture canopies scavenge more nutrients from the atmosphere than CE and CC.
1469338|Soil structure influences the growth and activity of organisms living in soil. In return, microbes, fauna, and plants affect structure. The objective of this paper is to review the role of plants in modifying soil structure. Vegetation affects structural form and stability at different scales and through various direct and indirect mechanisms. By penetrating the soil, roots form macropores which favour fluid transport. They also create zones of failure which contribute to fragment the soil and form aggregates. This phenomenon is enhanced by the wetting and drying cycles associated with plant growth. Drying also causes shrinkage and strengthening of the soil. Anchorage of roots and the exudation of cementing material stabilizes soil structure. Finally, as a source of C, roots and plant residues provide a food source to the microflora and fauna which contribute to structure formation and stabilization. In return, plant-induced changes in structure will affect plant growth mostly by modifying the root physical environment, and the water and nutrient cycles.
20055305|Here we present a stochastic biogeochemical model for the formation, transformation and mineralization of natural organic matter (NOM). The model is agent-based, with each software agent representing a single molecule of defined composition. Molecular properties and reactivities are estimated from composition and environmental parameters. Environmental parameters including temperature, pH, light intensity, dissolved O, moisture and enzyme activities are user controlled. Time is treated in discrete steps, and during each step potential reaction probabilities are evaluated for each molecule based on its structure and the environmental parameters. When reactions occur, the molecular composition is modified accordingly. The model uses small natural products and biopolymers for inputs, and the composition of the molecules produced is constrained only by the inputs and reaction stoichiometries, not by pre-defined structures. Example simulations using the program AlphaStep are presented, in which the breakdown of biopolymers and the condensation of small molecules both lead to molecular assemblages with elemental composition and average properties similar to those of aquatic NOM. This batch-reactor model can be expanded to include spatial information and environmental feedback.
1469719|Forest drainage has been used rather widely to improve tree growth in peatlands in northern and northeastern Europe and some parts of North America. The consequent fundamental change in the vegetation presumably gives rise to a concomitant change in the distribution of nutrients within the ecosystem. We investigated the post-drainage dynamics of soil properties (top 30-cm) and tree stand biomass on a series of peatlands drained for forestry in Finland to evaluate the sufficiency of soil nutrient pools for production forestry, and the ability of a floristic-ecological peatland site type classification for estimating soil nutrient status. The nutrient dynamics were assessed by comparing the nutrient pools in a large number of peatland sites differing in drainage age. Drainage unambiguously influenced stand biomass and structure and, consequently, the nutrient pool bound in trees. Nevertheless, with the exception of Mg, ditching did not decrease soil nutrient pools over the 75-year observation period. Thus, the soil pools seem sufficient for forest production on these sites. The decreasing trend in the soil Mg pool points on a potential risk in the long run, however. Peat depth and temperature sum were identified as significant sources of variation for the soil nutrient pools. Using soil Ca, K, Fe and N pools, on average 49% of our sites were grouped correctly according to the floristic-ecological site type classification. This classification most successfully described soil nutrient status among the most nutrient-poor sites. We concluded that the floristic-ecological classification of drained peatlands successfully describes their production potential, but not their total nutrient pools in varying thermoclimatic conditions.
1469251|The vertical distribution of dissolved greenhouse gases (CH<sub>4</sub>,  CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O), NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, and  <sup>13</sup>C of  CO<sub>2</sub> in Lake Biwa during a stagnant period was precisely determined.  CO<sub>2</sub> as well as NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was accumulated in the hypolimnion, whereas NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations were generally higher in the epilimnion than in the hypolimnion. In August, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and CH<sub>4</sub> were ephemerally accumulated at the thermocline. The concentration of CH<sub>4</sub> always exceeded equilibrium with respect to air/water exchange. N<sub>2</sub>O was rather uniformly distributed in both time and space, and remained near equilibrium with respect to air/water exchange. All of these observations are similar to other stratified, oligotrophic lakes, in which the hypolimnia were well oxygenated. The  <sup>13</sup>C of  CO<sub>2</sub> became more negative with increasing depth, and showed a strong negative correlation with apparent oxygen utilization. From the data, the  <sup>13</sup>C value of organic matter decomposed into  CO<sub>2</sub> in the hypolimnion was calculated by isotope mass-balance, and found to be in a similar range to  <sup>13</sup>C of phytoplankton and benthic algae and distinctively higher than  <sup>13</sup>C of both terrestrial and sedimentary organic matters. This suggests that autochthonous organic matter was the major source of  CO<sub>2</sub>.
1469958|We tested five hypotheses regarding the potential effects of precipitation change on spatial and temporal patterns of water flux, ion concentration in a semiarid, snowmelt-dominated forest in Little Valley, Nevada. Variations in data collected from 1995 to 1999 were used to examine the potential effects of snowpack amount and duration on ion concentrations and fluxes. Soil solution NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and ortho-phosphate concentrations and fluxes were uniformly low, and the variations in concentration bore no relationship to snowmelt water flux inputs of these ions. Weathering and cation exchange largely controlled the concentrations and fluxes of base cations from soils in these systems; however, soil solution base cation concentrations were affected by cation concentrations during snowmelt episodes. Soil solution Cl<sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations closely followed the patterns in snowmelt water, suggesting minimal buffering of either ion by soils. In contrast to other studies, the highest concentration and the majority of ion flux from the snowpack in Little Valley occurred in the later phases of snowmelt. Possible reasons for this include sublimation of the snowpack and dry deposition of organic matter during the later stages of snowmelt. Our comparison of interannual and spatial patterns revealed that variation in ion concentration rather than water flux is the most important driver of variation in ion flux. Thus, it is not safe to assume that changes in total precipitation amount will cause concomitant changes in ion inputs to this system.
1469420|Despite intensive biogeochemical research during the last thirty years, the relative importance of biological S turnover for the overall SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> budget of forested catchments remains uncertain. The objective of the present study was (i) to gain new insight into the S cycle of the Lehstenbach catchment (Northeastern Bavaria, Germany) through the analysis of stable isotopes of S and (ii) to differentiate between sites which are 'hot spots' for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction and sites where mineralization and adsorption/desorption processes are more important. The  <sup>34</sup>S values and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations of soil solutions, throughfall and groundwater at four different sites as well as runoff of the catchment were measured. The relatively low variability of  <sup>34</sup>S in throughfall and bulk precipitation was in contrast to the high temporal and spatial variability of  <sup>34</sup>S in the soil solution. Sulfate in the soil solution of upland sites was slightly depleted in  <sup>34</sup>S compared to input values. This was most likely due to S mineralization. Sulfate in the soil solution from wetland soils was clearly enriched in <sup>34</sup>S, indicating dissimilatory SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction. The observed spatial and temporal patterns of <sup>34</sup>S turnover and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentrations might explain the overall balanced S budget of the catchment. At a time of decreasing anthropogenic deposition SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> is currently released from upland soils. Furthermore, mineralization of organic S may contribute to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> release. Wetland soils in the catchment represent a sink for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> due to dissimilatory SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction.
40343515|In the prolonged absence of major disturbances, ecosystems may enter a stage of retrogression, which is characterized by decreased ecosystem process rates both above and belowground, and often reduced availability of phosphorus (P). Disturbance through wildfire can increase soil N losses through leaching or erosion, but in the long-term absence of fire, soil N could potentially become increasingly bound in more stable forms that are less available to microbes. We studied forms of N and microbial respiration kinetics in the humus layer of a group of islands that vary considerably in wildfire frequency (40-5,300 years since last fire), and which are known to enter retrogression in the prolonged absence of fire. We found a decrease in labile  with decreasing fire frequency but no change in total P. Soil microorganisms responded more strongly to I than to N addition, and microbial biomass N: P ratios remained unchanged across the gradient. However, the concentration of labile N was the best predictor of microbial respiration responses across the islands, and this provides some evidence that declining access to N could contribute to the decline in soil microbial activity during retrogression. Our results show that even though I is arguably the main limiting nutrient during retrogression in this chronosequence, long term absence of fire also causes a decline in N availability which negatively affects microbial activity. This in turn could potentially impair microbially driven processes such as decomposition and mineralization and further contribute to the reduced availability of soil nutrients during retrogression.

Andrews Experimental Forest in the central Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Total bulk N deposition, averaging 1.6 to 2.0 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, is low compared to other sites in the United States and little influenced by anthropogenic N sources. Streamwater N export is also low, averaging <latex>$<1\ \text{kg ha}^{-1}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$</latex>. DON is the predominant form of N exported from all watersheds, followed by PON, NH<sub>4</sub>-N, and NO<sub>3</sub>-N. Total annual stream discharge was a positive predictor of annual DON output in all six watersheds, suggesting that DON export is related to regional precipitation. In contrast annual discharge was a positive predictor of annual NO<sub>3</sub>-N output in one watershed, annual NH<sub>4</sub>-N output in three watersheds, and annual PON output in three watersheds. Of the four forms of N, only DON had consistent seasonal concentration patterns in all watersheds. Peak streamwater DON concentrations occurred in November-December after the onset of fall rains but before the peak in the hydrograph, probably due to flushing of products of decomposition that had built up during the dry summer. Multiple biotic controls on the more labile nitrate and ammonium concentrations in streams may obscure temporal DIN flux patterns from the terrestrial environment. Results from this study underscore the value of using several watersheds from a single climatic zone to make inferences about controls on stream N chemistry; analysis of a single watershed may preclude identification of geographically extensive mechanisms controlling N dynamics.
20456421|The Ria Formosa is a meso-tidal coastal lagoon experiencing enhanced nutrient concentrations. Assessment of sediment--seawater interaction is essential if nutrient dynamics and the risk of eutrophication are to be fully understood. Pore water concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate and nitrite were determined in cores from six sites. Changes in nutrients concentrations were measured in intertidal pools on sand and mud between tides. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations (200 mol l) and effluxes (123  14 mol m h) were greater from sand than mud (37  10 mol m h), possibly due to the binding of P with the &lt;63 m fraction.
25652599|Black carbon (BC) is a quantitatively important C pool in the global C cycle due to its relative recalcitrance compared with other C pools. However, mechanisms of BC oxidation and accompanying molecular changes are largely unknown. In this study, the long-term dynamics in quality and quantity of BC were investigated in cultivated soil using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. BC particles and changes in BC stocks were obtained from soil collected in fields that were cleared from forest by fire at 8 different times in the past (2, 3, 5, 20, 30, 50, 80 and 100 years before sampling) in western Kenya. BC contents rapidly decreased from 12.7 to 3.8 mg C g soil during the first 30 years following deposition, after which they slowly decreased to a steady state at 3.5 mg C g soil. BC-derived C losses from the top 0.1 m over 100 years were estimated at 6,000 kg C ha. The initial rapid changes in BC stocks resulted in a mean residence time of only around 8.3 years, which was likely a function of both decomposition as well as transport processes. The molecular properties of BC changed more rapidly on surfaces than in the interior of BC particles and more rapidly during the first 30 years than during the following 70 years. The Oc/C ratios (Oc is O bound to C) and carbonyl groups (C=O) increased over the first 10 and 30 years by 133 and 192%, respectively, indicating oxidation was an important process controlling BC quality. Al, Si, polysaccharides, and to a lesser extent Fe were found on BC particle surfaces within the first few years after BC deposition to soil. The protection by physical and chemical stabilization was apparently sufficient to not only minimize decomposition below detection between 30 and 100 years after deposition, but also physical export by erosion and vertical transport below 0.1 m.
20055302|We established a long-term field study in an old growth coniferous forest at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, OR, USA, to address how detrital quality and quantity control soil organic matter accumulation and stabilization. The Detritus Input and Removal Treatments (DIRT) plots consist of treatments that double leaf litter, double woody debris inputs, exclude litter inputs, or remove root inputs via trenching. We measured changes in soil solution chemistry with depth, and conducted long-term incubations of bulk soils from different treatments in order to elucidate effects of detrital inputs on the relative amounts and lability of different soil C pools. In the field, the addition of woody debris increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in O-horizon leachate and at 30 cm, but not at 100 cm, compared to control plots, suggesting increased rates of DOC retention with added woody debris. DOC concentrations decreased through the soil profile in all plots to a greater degree than did dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), most likely due to preferential sorption of high C:N hydrophobic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in upper horizons; percent hydrophobic DOM decreased significantly with depth, and hydrophilic DOM had a much lower and less variable C:N ratio. Although laboratory extracts of different litter types showed differences in DOM chemistry, percent hydrophobic DOM did not differ among soil solutions from different detrital treatments in the field, suggesting that microbial processing of DOM leachate in the field consumed easily degradable components, thus equalizing leachate chemistry among treatments. Total dissolved N leaching from plots with intact roots was very low (0.17 g
1468983|Concentrations of free amino acids were measured in soils from four major ecosystem types in arctic Alaska. Total free amino acid concentrations were several-fold higher than ammonium (the major form of inorganic nitrogen) in water extracts of soils. The dominant free amino acids in these soils were glycine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, and arginine. Concentrations of total amino acids ranged 5-fold across communities, being highest in tussock tundra and lowest in wet meadows. Incubation experiments indicate that the turnover of amino acids is rapid, which suggests high rates of gross nitrogen mineralization in these soils. The high concentrations and dynamic nature of soil free amino acids suggest that this nitrogen pool is a significant component of nitrogen cycling in these tundra ecosystems.
20519829|Here we present the within-site, seasonal, and interannual variations of the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope ratios of leaves, wood, bark and litter from four sites in the Amazon region, Brazil. Samples were collected in Manaus (3 0607" S; 600130" W), Ji-Paran (105307" S; 615706" W), and Santarm (22635" S; 544230" W) with mean annual precipitation of 2207, 2040 and 1909 mm respectively. The overall average for all leaf samples was-32.3  2.5 for C and+5.8  1.6 for N (n = 756). The leaf  values at these sites were often but not always statistically distinct from each other. The C values varied from-37.8 to-25.9. Pronounced differences in C values occurred with height associated with differences in forest structure. The C of leaf dry matter showed seasonal variations associated with the length of the dry season, despite the fact that total annual precipitation was similar among the studied sites. Leaf N values ranged from+0.9 to a maximum value of+10.9, and the Santarm sites showed more enriched values than Manaus and Ji-Paran sites. No seasonal variation was detected in the N of leaves, but significant differences were observed among sites and with changes in canopy height. The isotope ratio data are consistent with our current understanding of the roles of light, water availability, and recycling of soil-respired CO influences on C and consistent with our understanding that an open nitrogen cycle can lead to high N values despite a significant number of legumes in the vegetation.
1469597|A combination of stable isotope studies and 14C dating were used to identify the main sources and processes controlling streamwater DOC and TIC in a temperate non-forested watershed.  13C values for terrestrial (-24.9 to -29.1) and aquatic (-30.5 to -33.5) plants were similar to values reported in the literature for similar ecosystems.  13C values for DOC in soil solution and streamwater were consistent with soil and terrestrial vegetation, indicating that the terrestrial ecosystem is the dominant source of aquatic DOC in this watershed.  13C values of soil atmosphere CO2 (-17.2 to -25.2) were slightly less negative than would be expected for production via aerobic soil microbial decomposition and root respiration. There was a close correspondence between  13C values (-15.5 to -21.5) for streamwater TIC and soil atmospheric CO2 in the central part of the catchment where the stream drains CO2-rich peats. 14C dating showed that although peat has been accumulating in the watershed for at least 2700 years, DOC in soil pore water and streamwater contains carbon of predominantly recent origin (post-AD 1955).
40647942|Metal pollution, in combination with other environmental Stressors such as acid deposition and climate change, may disturb metal biogeochemical cycles. To investigate the influence of dissolved organic carbon, acidity and seasonality on metal geochemistry, this study has described concentrations of 19 metals as they pass through an acidified forested catchment on the Precambrian Shield in south-central Ontario, Canada. Metal, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulphate (SO) concentrations fluctuate throughout the catchment compartments as the water passes through and interacts with vegetation, soils and bedrock. Relationships among metals, DOC and SO are most pronounced in compartments where DOC and SO exhibit high variability, namely in the throughfall, organic horizon soil water, and wetland-draining stream. Metal, DOC and SO concentrations varied seasonally in the streams, and temporal coherence occurred among metal, DOC and SO concentrations in the organic horizon soil water and the wetland-draining stream (PCI). In the wetland-draining stream, the highest DOC, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, and V concentrations occur in the summer, whereas concentrations of SO and most other metals peak in the fall after a period of drought. Despite the rural location, provincial water quality objectives for surface water were exceeded for many metals when the peak fall values occurred.
1468877|Net N mineralization rates were measured in heathlands still dominated by ericaceous dwarf shrubs (Calluna vulgaris or Erica tetralix) and in heathlands that have become dominated by grasses (Molinia caerulea or Deschampsia flexuosa). Net N mineralization was measured in situ by sequential soil incubations during the year. In the wet area (gravimetric soil moisture content 74-130%), the net N mineralization rates were 4.4 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Erica soil and 7.8 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Molinia soil. The net nitrification rate was negligibly slow in either soil. In the dry area (gravimetric soil moisture content 7-38%), net N mineralization rates were 6.2 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Calluna soil, 10.9 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Molinia soil and 12.6 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Deschampsia soil. The Calluna soil was consistently drier throughout the year, which may partly explain its slower mineralization rate. Net nitrification was 0.3 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Calluna soil, 3.6 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Molinia soil and 5.4 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Deschampsia soil. The net nitrification rate increased proportionally with the net N mineralization rate suggesting ammonium availability may control nitrification rates in these soils. In the dry area, the faster net N mineralization rates in sites dominated by grasses than in the site dominated by Calluna may be explained by the greater amounts of organic N in the soil of sites dominated by grasses. In both areas, however, the net amount of N mineralized per gram total soil N was greater in sites dominated by Molinia or Deschampsia than in sites dominated by Calluna or Erica. This suggests that in heathlands invaded by grasses the quality of the soil organic matter may be increased resulting in more rapid rates of soil N cycling.
1469563|Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup>) concentrations in 34 intensively measured Canadian Shield streams near the Dorset Research Centre, central Ontario, were used to test a hydrogeologic model that uses simple measures of wetland area and till depth to identify catchments that produce SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> pulses. Mean annual measured maximum SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> concentrations were significantly greater in shallow till (<1 m depth) catchments containing wetlands than catchments covered with deeper tills (>1 m depth) containing wetlands or catchments with no wetlands. Average maximum SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> concentrations in wetland catchments during years with dry summers were >20 mg/L in 19 of 20 catchments with average till depths of <1 m, whereas concentrations were <20 mg/L in 5 of 6 watersheds with average till depths of >1 m. Peaks in mean annual maximum SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> concentrations from wetland catchments with shallow till occurred during summers with rain fall 150-200 mm less than potential evaporation estimates. There were no significant differences in mean average annual SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> concentration among the different catchments during wet summers, with SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> concentrations ranging from 6 to 13 mg/L. These observations suggest that a large portion of the temporal and spatial variation in SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-2</sup> chemistry and export can be predicted in headwater catchments of the Canadian Shield and perhaps in other landscapes where till depth influences upland-wetland hydrologic connections.
1469368| We monitored soil emissions of NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and CO<sub>2</sub> throughout the summer dry season at a remote North American sagebrush-steppe ecosystem following application of several resources, including water, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and sucrose. Despite low levels of soil NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (5.60 0.95 mg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N per kg soil, mean  S.E.), and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N (1.34 0.20 mg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N per kg soil), NO emissions ranged from about 0.2 to 2.8 ng NO-N m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, comparable to rates measured from many agricultural, tropical, and other undisturbed ecosystems. Soil wetting increased NO emissions as much as 400-fold when initial gravimetric soil moisture contents were less than about 50 mg kg<sub>soil</sub><sup>-1</sup> and soil temperature was greater than or equal to 20 C. Wetting treatments with 20 mg NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N kg<sub>soil</sub><sup>-1</sup> raised NO emission rates to a level that was nearly an order of magnitude higher than that observed after water addition alone. Wetting treatments with 20 mg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N kg<sub>soil</sub><sup>-1</sup>, 240 mg sucrose-C kg<sub>soil</sub><sup>-1</sup>, or NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> plus sucrose had no statistically significant effect upon NO emissions. Soil denitrifying enzyme activity was low at this site, and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions in the field were below detection limits. Soil nitrifying enzyme activity was extremely high at this site, indicating that the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> released by ammonification would be consumed at least once every 1.7 days. These observations indicate that NO emissions from this undisturbed ecosystem were likely a consequence of high nitrification activity, and that sagebrush-steppe ecosystems may be a more important NO source than has been previously assumed. 
1468769|The incorporation of sulfur from inorganic sulfate into organic matter was examined using <sup>35</sup>S for O1, O2 and A-horizon samples from two hardwood forests located at the Coweeta hydrologic laboratory, near Franklin, NC. This temperature-dependent transformation was stimulated by increased availability of sulfate or energy and the process was inhibited by sodium azide, erythromycin and candicidin. These data suggest that bacteria and fungi mediate sulfur incorporation via the formation of the covalent linkages. The latter possibility was confirmed by characterization of the organic sulfur fraction after isolation and partial purification from O2 layer material. Evidence is presented which indicates that the sulfur of this fraction is subject to mineralization after depolymerization of the carbon matrix and methods are given for the direct and indirect assessment of potential turnover rates. The availability of sulfate from mineralization appears to depend upon the rate of incorporation of sulfur into organic matter. Thus, substantially higher levels of extractable sulfate were detected when turnover of the isolated organosulfur fraction was assayed for in the presence of azide, an inhibitor of sulfate incoporation. However, the reverse was true when turnover was monitored in the presence of glucose and succinate which stimulate sulfate incorporation.
24715093|Biodiversity has been described as the diversity of life on earth within species, among species, and among ecosystems. The rate of biodiversity loss due to human activity in the last 50 years has been more rapid than at any other time in human history, and many of the drivers of biodiversity loss are increasing, including habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, climate change, and pollution, including pollution from reactive nitrogen (Nr). Of these stressors, climate change and Nr from anthropogenic activities are causing some of the most rapid changes. Climate change is causing warming trends that result in poleward and elevational range shifts of flora and fauna, and changes in phenology, particularly the earlier onset of spring events and migration, and lengthening of the growing season. Nitrogen (N) enrichment can enhance plant growth, but has been shown to favor, fast-growing, sometimes invasive, species over native species adapted to low N conditions. Although there have been only a few controlled studies on climate change and N interactions, inferences can be drawn from various field observations. For example, in arid ecosystems of southern California, elevated N deposition and changing precipitation patterns have promoted the conversion of native shrub communities to communities dominated by annual non-native grasses. Both empirical studies and modeling indicate that N and climate change can interact to drive losses in biodiversity greater than those caused by either stressor alone. Reducing inputs of anthropogenic Nr may be an effective mitigation strategy for protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change.
1469754|To investigate the influence of individual tree species on nitrogen (N) cycling in forests, we measured key characteristics of the N cycle in small single-species plots of five dominant tree species in the Catskill Mountains of New York State. The species studied were sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and red oak (Quercus rubra). The five species varied markedly in N cycling characteristics. For example, hemlock plots consistently showed characteristics associated with "slow" N cycling, including low foliar and litter N, high soil C:N, low extractable N pools, low rates of potential net N mineralization and nitrification and low NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> amounts trapped in ion-exchange resin bags buried in the mineral soil. Sugar maple plots had the lowest soil C:N, and the highest levels of soil characteristics associated with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production and loss (nitrification, extractable NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and resin bag NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). In contrast, red oak plots had near-average net mineralization rates and soil C:N ratios, but very low values of the variables associated with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production and loss. Correlations between soil N transformations and litter concentrations of N, lignin, lignin:N ratio, or phenolic constituents were generally weak. The inverse correlation between net nitrification rate and soil C:N that has been reported in the literature was present in this data set only if red oak plots were excluded from the analysis. This study indicates that tree species can exert a strong control on N cycling in forest ecosystems that appears to be mediated through the quality of soil organic matter, but that standard measures of litter quality cannot explain the mechanism of control.
41490468|Biogeochemical properties, including nutrient concentrations, carbon gas fluxes, microbial biomass, and hydrolytic enzyme activities, were determined along a strong nutrient gradient in an ombrotrophic peatland in the Republic of Panama. Total phosphorus in surface peat decreased markedly along a 2.7 km transect from the marginal Raphia taedigera swamp to the interior sawgrass swamp, with similar trends in total nitrogen and potassium. There were parallel changes in the forest structure: basal area decreased dramatically from the margins to the interior, while tree diversity was greatest at sites with extremely low concentrations of readily-exchangeable phosphate. Soil microbial biomass concentrations declined in parallel with nutrient concentrations, although microbes consistently contained a large proportion (up to 47%) of the total soil phosphorus. Microbial C:P and N:P ratios and hydrolytic enzyme activities, including those involved in the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, increased towards the nutrient-poor wetland interior, indicating strong belowground nutrient limitation. Soil CO fluxes and CH fluxes did not vary systematically along the nutrient gradient, although potential soil respiration determined on drained soils was lower from nutrient-poor sites. Soil respiration responded strongly to drainage and increased temperature. Taken together, our results demonstrate that nutrient status exerts a strong control on above and below-ground processes in tropical peatlands with implications for carbon dynamics and hence long term development of such ecosystems.
1468810|Major sulfur pools are quantified in soils and aboveground biomass of a coniferous boreal forest. Total ecosystem S averages 1395 kg.ha<sup>-1</sup> of which 98% is found in the soil, with 89% being in the mineral horizons. Organic S dominates in soil, tree parts (trunks, branches + foliage, roots) and litterfall, ranging from 77 to 99% of total S concentration. Carbon-bonded S, ester sulfate and SO<sub>4</sub>-S in soil profiles range respectively from 51-68%, 29-37% and 1-14% of total S concentrations and account respectively for 57, 33 and 10% of total S on an areal basis. Adsorbed SO<sub>4</sub> accounts for 82% of total SO<sub>4</sub>, and can be predicted from Al bound to organic matter, amorphous Al and pH (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81). There is a strong relationship between% carbon and carbon-bonded S in 4 of the 5 soil horizons studied which represent over 95% of the total soil organic matter, whereas ester sulfate is related to% carbon in 3 soil horizons representing only 37% of the soil organic matter. An analysis of atmospheric S loading and S data for 10 forested sites in Europe and North America suggests that the size of the organic S pool in forested systems is independent of atmospheric loading.
20456493|We conducted <tex-math>${}^{15}\text{NO}{}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> stable isotope tracer releases in nine streams with varied intensities and types of human impacts in the upstream watershed to measure nitrate (<tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math>) cycling dynamics. Mean ambient <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> concentrations of the streams ranged from 0.9 to 21,000 g l <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math>--N. Major N-transforming processes, including uptake, nitrification, and denitrification, all increased approximately two to three orders of magnitude along the same gradient. Despite increases in transformation rates, the efficiency with which stream biota utilized available <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math>-decreased along the gradient of increasing <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math>. Observed functional relationships of biological N transformations (uptake and nitrification) with <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> concentration did not support a 1st order model and did not show signs of Michaelis--Menten type saturation. The empirical relationship was best described by a Efficiency Loss model, in which log-transformed rates (uptake and nitrification) increase with log-transformed nitrate concentration with a slope less than one. Denitrification increased linearly across the gradient of <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> concentrations, but only accounted for 1% of total <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> uptake. On average, 20% of stream water <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> was lost to denitrification per km, but the percentage removed in most streams was &lt;5% km. Although the rate of cycling was greater in streams with larger <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> concentrations, the relative proportion of <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> retained per unit length of stream decreased as <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> concentration increased. Due to the rapid rate of <tex-math>$\text{NO}_{3}^{-}$</tex-math> turnover, these streams have a great potential for short-term retention of N from the landscape, but the ability to remove N through denitrification is highly variable.
1468540|Bulk inorganic nitrogen deposition was monitored over a period of 3 years at the Bavella Pass (Corsica, France). Annual fluxes range between 126 and 150  mol.m<sup>-2</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>, increasing slightly with annual rainfall. Natural background average concentrations of rain water and associated fluxes were estimated from a classification of rain events into 'natural' (Oceanic and Saharan), polluted and composite. Long range transport of incoming polluted air masses increases the atmospheric wet nitrogen input by at least a factor of 1.6 in this Mediterranean area. Extrapolation of atmospheric dissolved inorganic nitrogen input to the Western Mediterranean leads to fluxes of 80 to 100  mol.m<sup>-2</sup>.d<sup>-1</sup>. This atmospheric input is in the same order of magnitude as the inorganic nitrogen riverine input. As a consequence, the nitrogen budget for the Mediterranean has had to be reassessed. Atmospheric wet inorganic nitrogen input is of noticeable importance to marine Mediterranean ecosystems, representing on average 10 to 25% of new production in the Western Basin, with values of up to 60% in oligotrophic zones.
1469309|Forest ecosystems are currently being exposed to changes in chemical inputs and it is suggested that physical climate is also changing. A novel approach has been used to study the effects of ionic inputs and climatic conditions on forest soils by reciprocally exchanging lysimeters containing undisturbed soil columns beween four forest sites in Europe. The soil columns contained no living roots and simulated a clear cut situation. The soils chosen represented different stages of acidification and were taken from sites along a transect of increasing exposure to acidic and nitrogen pollution. The purpose of the study was to quantify the reactions of soils when transferred to different environments. Element balances were used as an aggregated indicator to describe the reaction of the soil. The input of protons in local throughfall increased along the transect from 0.01 kmol ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> H<sup>+</sup> at the unpolluted site up to 1.10 kmol ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> at the most polluted site. Our results show that soil acidification always resulted from a combination of acid deposition and biological transformations of nitrogen through nitrification of imported ammonium, mineralized N, or stored N. The balances indicate that between 54% and 91% of the soil acidification resulted from nitrification processes which were driven by a complex reaction when climatic and pollution conditions were changed simultaneously. The combined changes in atmosphic inputs and climatic conditions, as expected with global change, may have serious consequences for soil acidification and long term organic matter turnover.
41410586|Heterotrophic soil respiration is an important flux within the global carbon cycle. Exact knowledge of the response functions for soil temperature and soil water content is crucial for a reliable prediction of soil carbon turnover. The classical statistical approach for the in situ determination of the temperature response (Q or activation energy) of field soil respiration has been criticised for neglecting confounding factors, such as spatial and temporal changes in soil water content and soil organic matter. The aim of this paper is to evaluate an alternative method to estimate the temperature and soil water content response of heterotrophic soil respiration. The new method relies on inverse parameter estimation using a 1-dimensional CO transport and carbon turnover model. Inversion results showed that different formulations of the temperature response function resulted in estimated response factors that hardly deviated over the entire range of soil water content and for temperature below 25C. For higher temperatures, the temperature response was highly uncertain due to the infrequent occurrence of soil temperatures above 25C. The temperature sensitivity obtained using inverse modelling was within the range of temperature sensitivities estimated from statistical processing of the data. It was concluded that inverse parameter estimation is a promising tool for the determination of the temperature and soil water content response of soil respiration. Future synthetic model studies should investigate to what extent the inverse modelling approach can disentangle confounding factors that typically affect statistical estimates of the sensitivity of soil respiration to temperature and soil water content.
24715156|The Scheldt estuary (Belgium/The Netherlands) was sampled along the entire salinity gradient from 2003 to 2005 for silicic acid (DSi), biogenic silica (BSi), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and pigments. Net DSi consumption and/or release within the estuary were investigated by comparing measured DSi concentrations with (fully-transient) model simulations of the concentrations that would have been obtained in case of conservative transport. The DSi consumption was at maximum in May due to diatoms of presumably marine origin blooming in the lower estuary. DSi consumption decreased rapidly in July, probably because of the grazing pressure of copepods also of marine origin, and DSi was released from late summer onwards. Multiple regression analyses showed that most of the BSi did not follow the dynamics of the living diatoms but rather that of the SPM. They also suggested that diatoms were more silicified in the upper estuary than in the lower estuary. Phytoliths were not expected to contribute significantly to the BSi pool. As BSi dynamics strongly differed from those of diatoms and DSi, this study highlighted the importance of taking BSi into account when investigating estuarine silica dynamics. This study also revealed the fundamental role of the coupling between the biogeochemical and ecological functioning of the lower estuary and that of the adjacent coastal zone. This contrasts with the classical consideration that estuaries act as one-way filters for dissolved and particulate material of riverine origin.
1468621| Metal (Cu, Ni, Zn, Fe, Mn and Al) budgets were measured for 5 lakes and their catchments near Sudbury, Ontario, an area severely affected by the emission and deposition of strong acids (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>/SO<sub>2</sub>) and metals. Three of the lakes were circum-neutral (pH 6.3-7.1) during the study period, while one lake had a pH of  4.8 and a fifth had very low pH ( 4.4). The lakes' catchments were all sources of Al, Mn and Ni, but were sinks for Cu and Zn. The Fe results were inconsistent; two lakes' catchments were sources while three were sinks. The acidic lakes were conservative (i.e. net retention of zero) with respect to Cu and Ni, while the circum-neutral lakes were effective sinks for these 2 metals. All of the lakes were sinks for Zn and Al, but the acidic lakes were less effective. All lakes were also Fe sinks. While there was no pattern relative to the lakes' pH's, there was a trend towards increasing Fe retention with increasing water replenishment time. The most acidic lake was actually a source of Mn, while the others were sinks. 
1469611|The objective of this study was to examine chemical changes in porewaters that occur over small scales (cm) as groundwater flows through the hyporheic zone and discharges to a stream in a temperate forest of northern Wisconsin. Hyporheic-zone porewaters were sampled at discrete depths of 2, 10, 15, 61, and 183 cm at three study sites in the study basin. Chemical profiles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and pH show dramatic changes between 61 cm sediment depth and the water-sediment interface. Unless discrete samples at small depth intervals are taken, these chemical profiles are not accounted for. Similar trends were observed at the three study locations, despite each site having very different hydraulic-flow regimes. Increases in DOC concentration by an order of magnitude from 61 to 15 cm depth with a corresponding decrease in pH and rapid decreases in the molecular weight of the DOC suggest that aliphatic compounds (likely organic acids) are being generated in the hyporheic zone. Estimated efflux rates of DOC, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub> to the stream are 6.2, 0.79, 0.13 moles m<sup>2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with the vast majority of these materials produced in the hyporheic zone. Very little of these materials are accounted for by sampling stream water, suggesting rapid uptake and/or volatilization.
1469471|The emission of the greenhouse gas CH<sub>4</sub> from rice paddies is strongly influenced by management practices such as the input of ammonium-based fertilisers. We assessed the impact of different levels (200 and 400 kgN.ha<sup>-1</sup>) of urea and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> on the microbial processes involved in production and consumption of CH<sub>4</sub> in rice field soil. We used compartmented microcosms which received fertiliser twice weekly. Potential CH<sub>4</sub> production rates were substantially higher in the rice rhizosphere than in unrooted soil, but were not affected by fertilisation. However, CH<sub>4</sub> emission was reduced by the addition of fertiliser and was negatively correlated with pore water NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration, probably as the consequence of elevated CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation due to fertilisation. CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation as well as numbers of methanotrophs was distinctly stimulated by the addition of fertiliser and by the presence of the rice plant. Without fertiliser addition, nitrogen-limitation of the methanotrophs will restrict the consumption of CH<sub>4</sub>. This may have a major impact on the global CH<sub>4</sub> budget, as nitrogen-limiting conditions will be the normal situation in the rice rhizosphere. Elevated potential nitrifying activities and numbers were only detected in microcosms fertilised with urea. However, a substantial part of the nitrification potential in the rhizosphere of rice was attributed to the activity of methanotrophs, as was demonstrated using the inhibitors CH<sub>3</sub>F and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>.
1468846| The Orinoco River, which is hydrologically unregulated and has a minimally disturbed watershed, was sampled quantitatively over a four-year interval. In conjunction with the sampling, a method was developed for quantifying statistical uncertainty in the estimates of annual transport. The discharge-weighted mean concentration of total suspended solids in the Orinoco River is 80 mg/l, which corresponds to total annual transport of 90 10<sup>6</sup> t/y, or, expressed per unit of watershed area, 960 kg/ha/y, of which 96% is inorganic. The mean for dissolved solids is 34 mg/l, of which 25 mg/l is inorganic. The total transport of inorganic material, with a small allowance for bedload, is 128 10<sup>6</sup> t/y, which corresponds to an erosion rate of 4 cm/1000 y. Concentrations of dissolved and suspended constituents derived from rock weathering are very low because of dilution from high runoff (1190 mm/y), coverage of the southern part of the drainage by shield rock, and minimal watershed disturbance. Seasonal patterns in dissolved and suspended constituents are repeated with a high degree of consistency from one year to the next. For most variables, relationships between transport and discharge are described adequately by a power function. There are three categories of response to changing discharge: purging (exponent > 1: soluble organic fractions and all particulate fractions), dilution (exponent 0-1: major ionic solids and silicon), and conservation (exponent < 0: nitrate, interannual). Variability across seasons and across years is highest for the particulate constituents, but within this group variability is lower for the organic than for the inorganic components. Major ions that originate primarily from the atmosphere have a higher seasonal variability than major ions that originate primarily from weathering. Potassium and soluble silicon have the lowest variabilities. Variability is much lower across years than across seasons for most constituents. Because of high runoff per unit area, the Orinoco drainage has a high specific transport of organic carbon (72 kg/ha/y, 6.8 10<sup>6</sup> t/y, 1.6% of global river transport), even though the concentrations of organic carbon in the river are not exceptionally high (mean, 4.4 mg/l dissolved, 1.4 mg/l particulate). Concentrations of ammonium (35 g/l as N) and of nitrate (80 g/l as N) are high given the undisturbed nature of the watershed and the high amount of runoff. The high transport rate for total nitrogen (5.7 kg/ha/y, 0.54 10<sup>6</sup> t/y, 1.5% of global river transport) can be sustained only by high rates of nitrogen fixation within the watershed. Concentrations of soluble phosphorus are within the range expected for undisturbed river systems (20 g/l), but concentrations of particulate phosphorus are low because the amounts of particulate matter are small and the phosphorus per unit weight of suspended matter is low. Phosphorus transport (0.75 kg/ha/y) can be accounted for easily by weathering of the parent material, even within the Guayana Shield, where weathering rates are lowest. Biological modification of nutrient and carbon fractions during transit along the main stem are minimal. 
20519808|There are numerous reports on the accumulation of ammonia in the mounds of soil-feeding termites. Here, we provided direct evidence for an effective mineralization of nitrogenous soil organic matter in the gut of Cubitermes spp., which gives rise to enormous ammonia concentrations in the intestinal tract. In Cubitermes ugandensis, the ammonia content of the nest material [24.5 mol (g dry wt.)] was about 300-fold higher than that of the parent soil. Large amounts of ammonia were present throughout the intestinal tract, with lowest values in the extremely alkaline gut sections (pH &gt; 12) and highest values posterior hindgut [185 mol (g dry wt.)]. Results obtained with other Cubitermes species were similar. Ammonia concentrations in the posterior hindgut of these humivorous species (up to 130 mM) are among the highest values ever reported for soil macroinvertebrates and are matched only by insects feeding on an extremely protein-rich diet (e.g., the sarcophageous larvae of blowflies). Volatilization of ammonia [about 10 nmol (g fresh wt.) h], either directly by emission from the termite body or indirectly from their feces, led to NH concentrations in the nest atmosphere of C. ugandensis that were three orders of magnitude above the ambient background -- a relative accumulation that is considerably higher than that observed with CH and CO. Together with previous results, these observations document that through their feeding activity and due to the physicochemical and biochemical properties of their digestive system, soil-feeding termites effectively catalyze the transformation of refractory soil organic nitrogen to a plant-available form that is protected from leaching by adsorption to the nest soil. Nitrogen mineralization rates of soil-feeding termites may surpass those effected by tropical earthworms and should contribute significantly to nitrogen fluxes in tropical ecosystems.
1468927|At the floodplain scale, spatial pattern and successional development of riparian vegetation are under the control of geomorphic processes. The geomorphic and hydraulic characteristics of stream channels affect the sorting of organic material and inorganic sediment through erosion/sedimentation during floods. In turn, the proportion of fine sediments fractions differs by location within a given community of riparian forest succession. In this paper we tested the effect of geomorphic features of floodplains, through soil grain size sorting, on the nitrogen cycling in riparian forest soils. Two typical riparian forests formed by vertical accretion deposits from repeated addition of sediments from overbank flow have been chosen along the River Garonne, southwest France. These riparian forests had equivalent vegetation, flood frequency and duration, differing only in soil grain size composition: one riparian forest had sandy soils and the other had loamy soils. The evolution of the main soil physical and chemical parameters as well as denitrification (DNT), N uptake (N<sub>U</sub>) and mineralization (N<sub>M</sub>) rates were measured monthly over a period of 13 months in the two study sites. The loamy riparian forest presented a better physical retention of suspended matter during floods. Moreover, in situ denitrification rates (DNT) and N uptake by plants (N<sub>U</sub>) measured in the loamy riparian forest soils were significantly greater than in the sandy soils. Although DNT and N<sub>U</sub> could be in competition for available nitrogen, the peak rates of these two processes did not occur at the same period of the year, N<sub>U</sub> being more important during the dry season when DNT was minimum, while DNT rates were maximum following the spring floods. N retention by uptake (N<sub>U</sub>) and loss by DNT represented together the equivalent of 32% of total organic nitrogen deposited during floods on the sandy riparian forest soils and 70% on the loamy ones. These significant differences between the two sites show that, at the landscape level, one should not estimate the rates of N<sub>U</sub> and DNT, in riparian forests soils only on the basis of vegetation, but should take also into account the geomorphic features of the floodplain.
41490508|Understanding the nature of organic matter is a necessary first step in assessing contaminant bioavailability and allowing water supply managers to optimise the treatment train in the aim of providing safe and inexpensive drinking water. This study provides further insight into the composition, structure and functional groups of dissolved organic matter (DOM) (both hydrophobic and hydrophilic) from urban aquatic systems by means of various analytical techniques (DAX-8/XAD-4 fractionation, elemental analysis, UV and FTIR spectroscopies, C and N isotopic analysis, size exclusion chromatography and Pyrolysis-GC-MS). The analytical range chosen for this study constitutes a powerful tool in the characterisation of DOM in urban water. The inclusion of information from one technique to the next might not only serve as a support to each one, but also as a complement. The DOM fraction from treated effluent and, more generally, DOM from urban water (i.e. receiving treated effluent) display a strong hydrophilic characteristic [i.e. low humic substance (HS) content, low SUVA], along with a high distribution in molecular weights observed by SEC and low average molecular weight. Due to the origin of this DOM, proteinaceous structures constitute the main compounds, as observed by FTIR and Py-GC-MS. Such characteristics (i.e. heterogeneity, low average molecular weight and diverse functional groups, which make up a total of N) could explain that DOM from treated effluent displayed a strong reactive potential metals pollutants as previously demonstrated.
20456470|Monitoring of Phaeocystis since 1948 during the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey indicates that over the last 5.5 decades the distribution of its colonies in the North Atlantic Ocean was not restricted to neritic waters: occurrence was also recorded in the open Atlantic regions sampled, most frequently in the spring. Apparently, environmental conditions in open ocean waters, also those far offshore, are suitable for complete lifecycle development of colonies (the only stage recorded in the survey). In the North Sea the frequency of occurrence was also highest in spring. Its southeastern part was the Phaeocystis abundance hotspot of the whole area covered by the survey. Frequency was especially high before the 1960s and after the 1980s, i.e., in the periods when anthropogenic nutrient enrichment was relatively low. Changes in eutrophication have obviously not been a major cause of long-term Phaeocystis variation in the southeastern North Sea, where total phytoplankton biomass was related significantly to river discharge. Evidence is presented for the suggestion that Phaeocystis abundance in the southern North Sea is to a large extent determined by the amount of Atlantic Ocean water flushed in through the Dover Strait. Since Phaeocystis plays a key role in element fluxes relevant to climate the results presented here have implications for biogeochemical models of cycling of carbon and sulphur. Sea-to-air exchange of CO and dimethyl sulphide (DMS) has been calculated on the basis of measurements during single-year cruises. The considerable annual variation in phytoplankton and in its Phaeocystis component reported here does not warrant extrapolation of such figures.
1468995|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the dominant form of carbon in transport in blackwater rivers, and bacteria are the major biological agents of its utilization. This study describes longitudinal patterns in DOC concentration and relates them to suspended bacterial populations in the channel. Concentrations of total DOC, three molecular weight fractions, and bacterial numbers were determined at 12 sites along the Ogeechee River in 1985-86 and 1989 during periods of low and high discharge. Suspended bacterial populations were compared with DOC concentrations to determine if differences in bacterial abundance were related to longitudinal patterns of DOC concentration. Three distinct longitudinal patterns were observed: (1) The longitudinal pattern followed by both total and intermediate molecular weight DOC concentrations was a linear function of the geographic distance along the river. (2) During low flow conditions, there was a high degree of correspondence between patterns of bacterial numbers and low MW DOC (< 1000 apparent MW). (3) During periods of high discharge, the proportion of high (> 10,000) and intermediate (1000-10,000) MW fractions increased, and there was no longer a clear relationship between bacterial cells and low MW DOC.
20456492|The impact of extended herbicide (H) and annual fertilizer (F) treatments on the mineral soil carbon (C) pool and nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) availability were analyzed in managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations in the Piedmont of Georgia in stands ranging from 4 to 16 years old. Mineral soil C, N, P, and extractable P were measured in 66 plots in three locations comparing H, F, and their combination HF to the Control plots. Soils were sampled in January 2000 near Eatonton (n = 40), in August 2001 near Athens (n = 12), and in March 2003 near Dawsonville (n = 14). In addition, twelve plots (two H and two HF at each location) were measured on 17 dates using a mixed bead resin core technique to estimate mineral soil N availability. At all three study locations the H treatment tended to deplete the mineral soil C pool while, overall, the F treatments did not determine any significant mineral soil C increase. The soil C pool (0- to 50-cm depth) was depleted by about 5 Mg C ha under the H-treated plots near Eatonton. The HF plots had much higher resin-extractable N than the corresponding H plots in all months of the year. At a plot level, HF values ranged from about 9 to 3,195 g N g resin while H values ranged from about 4 to 858 g N g resin. The corresponding annual cumulative resin-extractable N ranged from about 13 kg N ha in the H to about 372 kg N ha in the HF. Extractable P values were also elevated in all F-treated plots. Fertilization and herbicide treatments favored C sequestration only in the aboveground biomass. No significant change was observed in the mineral soil C pool, despite the generally observed increases in soil available N and P.
1468904| Carbon isotope ratios ( <sup>13</sup>C) for bubble CH<sub>4</sub> in a submerged paddy soil were studied in Yokohama, Japan, throughout a growing period, and its variation was found. Bubble CH<sub>4</sub> collected from other 33 paddy fields in Japan was also measured for its  <sup>13</sup>C and the results agreed with Yokohama. Furthermore, the variation occurred irrespective of the amount and the type of supplied organic substances to the fields (whole rice straw, rice stubble, or compost). The  <sup>13</sup>C value (average value of -55.9  4.24) from these paddy fields was higher than those of the CH<sub>4</sub> emitted from African and North American paddies. The higher value was little affected by their difference in the supplied organic substances. CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation likely occurs for bubble CH<sub>4</sub> in the shallow paddy fields. A rough estimate of the total CH<sub>4</sub> production, using isotope mass balance, showed that 17 to 22% of organic carbon supplied to Japanese paddies transforms to CH<sub>4</sub>. 
41410578|Previous theoretical analyses based on Arrhenius kinetics and thermodynamics have shown that the temperature sensitivity of low-quality substrate is higher than that of high-quality substrate. Because soils store large amounts of low-quality carbon, understanding its response to increasing temperatures will help to predict the response of atmospheric CO to climate change. However, empirical studies do not provide conclusive evidence to corroborate this theoretical argument. Although there are various possible reasons for this disagreement, the theory behind this argument has not been scrutinized carefully. Based on a simple mathematical analysis of the Arrhenius equation it is shown here that lowquality substrates are less temperature sensitive when analyzed in absolute rather than in relative terms, a result that may seem counterintuitive to previous theory. However, this is a paradox intrinsic to the Arrhenius equation and it is often ignored within the 'quality-temperature' debate. In fact, different measures commonly used to analyze the temperature sensitivity of different substrates can provide apparently different and contradictory results even though they are based on the same basic principles. Distinguishing between absolute and relative measures of sensitivity is essential for understanding the sensitivity of respiration to environmental change. An analysis of the available empirical evidence on this topic shows that most studies actually agree with the Arrhenius and thermodynamics theory, with less disagreement than previously thought. To address some of the issues identified here, a formal theoretical framework is proposed to study the sensitivity of respiration rates with respect to changes in multiple drivers of decomposition.
4151461|Streams draining peatland systems contain a number of different C- species, all of which are linked either directly or indirectly to the cycling of C in the terrestrial environment. Concentrations and fluxes of dissolved, particulate and gaseous forms of carbon were measured along a network of streams draining an acidic peatland catchment (46.3 km
20456445|Chloroform concentrations were observed and input and output fluxes estimated over a 2-yr period in a small coniferous catchment (0.22 km) in southeast Sweden. Water discharge was measured daily, and runoff water was sampled bi-weekly for chloroform analysis. An approximate chloroform budget was calculated, which indicated that the annual output of 6 g m yr was approximately six times higher than the input, inferring an internal source of chloroform in the catchment. To the best of our knowledge, neither flux estimates nor mass balances have previously been made for chloroform on a catchment scale, nor have data regarding natural runoff variation with time been gathered. Concentrations of chloroform in runoff were found to be generally high during wet periods, such as spring, but also peaked during summer rain events. The observed pattern suggests that chloroform is formed in surface soil layers and transported to the outlet under high-flow conditions and during dry-period rain events; it is lost through degradation or evaporation during drier periods due to longer soil water residence times. The data suggest that the variation among replicates increases with concentration; this emphasizes the need to know what the degree of on-site variation is, so one can collect a sufficient number of replicates to permit detection of spatial or temporal changes.
24715102|One of the less studied components of carbon cycling that could improve our understanding of how and how strongly Amazonian ecosystems act as sinks or sources of carbon is the amount that is carried downstream by rivers. In this paper, we show that a headwater river can carry from 25 to 130 % of the reported sink for Amazonian forests, therefore not being negligible for ecosystem-level carbon budgets. Based on monthly measurements from May 2004 to April 2005 of the upper Purus River, southwestern Amazonia, we found that: water pH, dissolved oxygen, specific electrical conductivity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were inversely related to water discharge and precipitation; pCO was directly and strongly related to discharge and precipitation, and to a lesser extent to pH and dissolved oxygen; and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was not related to any measured variable. Annual flux of dissolved carbon (DIC + DOC) at the sampling site was estimated as 604  55 Gg C a. More than 75 % was in the form of bicarbonate, with the remainder as CO and DOC. This amount is equivalent to 0.15  0.01 Mg C ha a in the upstream drainage basin, which is on the same order of magnitude as terrestrial carbon fixation.
1469488|Carbon pools and fluxes were quantified along an environmental gradient in northern Arizona. Data are presented on vegetation, litter, and soil C pools and soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from ecosystems ranging from shrub-steppe through woodlands to coniferous forest and the ecotones in between. Carbon pool sizes and fluxes in these semiarid ecosystems vary with temperature and precipitation and are strongly influenced by canopy cover. Ecosystem respiration is approximately 50 percent greater in the more mesic, forest environment than in the dry shrub-steppe environment. Soil respiration rates within a site vary seasonally with temperature but appear to be constrained by low soil moisture during dry summer months, when approximately 75% of total annual soil respiration occurs. Total annual amount of CO<sub>2</sub> respired across all sites is positively correlated with annual precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature. Results suggest that changes in the amount and periodicity of precipitation will have a greater effect on C pools and fluxes than will changes in temperature in the semiarid Southwestern United States.
1468907|In the Netherlands, fens that are fed by polluted river water are often eutrophic, whereas fens fed by calcium-rich groundwater often are mesotrophic. Differences in trophic status can not always be attributed to differences in the nutrient load of the water. In this paper we try to determine if the inflow of river water in fens, in fact, accelerates the soil nutrient release, thereby creating more eutrophic conditions ('internal eutrophication'). For this purpose, we compared nutrient release rates (N, P and K) in soil cores from Sphagnum peat and Carex peat saturated with different media, that were artificially created to mimic the three basic water sources: polluted river water, unpolluted calcium-rich groundwater and rainwater. In addition, we studied the effect of temperature and water level on nutrient release rates. The experiments proved that Sphagnum peat released much more P and ammonium than Carex peat. The strong site effect proved consistent throughout the water chemistry treatments, which indicates that soil quality may be the most important agent determining nutrient release rates. Nevertheless, it was established that water chemistry and water level are of significant influence on nutrient release rates in peat soils. In particular, river water stimulated P release by the peat, most notably in the Sphagnum peat. P-release in both soils was only minor when the soils were incubated in clean Ca-rich groundwater. It is suggested that P release is strongly associated with soil chemical processes, and that high P release rates after incubation in river water are due to the high sulphate content of the water. The net release from the soil of ammonium, potassium and phosphate increased with increasing temperature. A freezing treatment significantly increased nutrient availability. The results of the experiments are examined in the context of hydrologic management strategies for the conservation of fens in agricultural landscapes.
24715188|This study investigated the effects of the invasive polychaete Marenzelleria viridis (Marenzelleria) on the biogeochemistry of sandy marine sediments. A 27-day microcosm experiment was conducted to evaluate net microbial reactions, fluxes and porewater profiles of key solutes under the presence of Marenzelleria in two sediment types; one containing autochthonous organic matter (0.4 %) and another slightly amended with seagrass detritus (Ruppia maritima; 0.5 %). Fluxes of TCO and O were two- to three-fold increased in the presence of Marenzelleria and were higher in amended (256 mmol m d) than in non-amended sediments (117 mmol m d). Marenzelleria stimulated carbon degradation and sulfate reduction in both sediment treatments by influencing porewater chemistry and DOC availability. Marenzelleria flushed out inhibitory porewater metabolites (i.e. TCO, THS and NH) while replenishing SO Furthermore, sulfate consumption was significantly higher in Marenzelleria sediment (7987 mmol m d) than in defaunated controls (3650 mmol m d), which indicated a 7592 % lower DOC availability in the former. DOC excreted by Marenzelleria may have sustained 1732 % of SO reduction. Lower C:S ratios (1.61.7) in Marenzelleria compared to defaunated sediments (2.42.8) suggest basic differences in carbon mineralization pathways, with e.g. H as a possible substrate for sulfate reduction in the former treatment and higher fermentative TCO formation in the latter. No significant stimulatory effect of Marenzelleria was evident for microbial NH production. Total budgets revealed that Marenzelleria increased C mineralization by 50 % in amended sediment, compared to only 9 % in non-amended sediment. This study suggests that the presence of Marenzelleria may lead to a marked stimulation of sulfate reduction and degradation of refractory organic matter. Marenzelleria invasion may therefore have widespread consequences for microbial pathways and organic matter processing in sandy marine sediments.
1469478|Methane flux was measured, employing the micrometeorological eddy correlation technique, during two growing seasons (1991 and 1992) in a peatland in Minnesota. As compared to 1991, the 1992 season was wetter and cooler. Here we examine the seasonal distributions of CH<sub>4</sub> flux and the relationship between concurrently measured CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes. Midday CH<sub>4</sub> flux was low (1.5 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) during late May in both seasons. Subsequently, the flux ranged from 2.5 to 5.5 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> during early June to early July in both years. Methane flux peaked at 6.5 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> during mid July in 1991. The peak flux (8.0 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) in 1992 occurred 3 weeks later. A sustained drop in water table during late July to late August in 1991 may have reduced the methane emission. During mid August-mid October in 1992, the water table was consistently high and the flux ranged from 2.0 to 3.0 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. As compared to 1991, CH<sub>4</sub> flux during this time in 1992 was higher by about 1.0 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> because of the overriding influence of the water table. Integration over the growing season (late May to mid October), indicated that this ecosystem released approximately 10.4 and 11.5 g C m<sup>-2</sup> of CH<sub>4</sub> in 1991 and 1992, respectively. We examined our concurrent measurements on methane flux and canopy photosynthesis under a variety of environmental conditions from different parts of the growing season. On a time scale of the entire season, the overall patterns of methane flux and canopy photosynthesis were similar in both years. Canopy photosynthesis, however, showed large day-to-day changes in response to variations in temperature and moisture. Corresponding changes in methane flux during these selected periods were relatively small. The slopes and correlation coefficients of linear regressions between methane flux and photosynthesis data varied widely. Accordingly, a close coupling between short-term (day to day) variations in methane flux and canopy photosynthesis was not evident.
20456550|Increased export of biologically available nitrogen (N) to the coastal zone is strongly linked to eutrophication, which is a major problem in coastal marine ecosystems (NRC (2000) Clean Coastal Waters: Understanding and Reducing the Effects of Nutrient Pollution. National Academy Press, Washington, DC; Bricker et al. (1999) National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment. Effects of nutrient enrichment in the nation's estuaries. NOAA-NOS Special Projects Office, Silver Spring, MD). However, not all of the nitrogen input to a watershed is exported to the coast (Howarth et al. (1996) Biogeochemistry 35:75-139; Jordan and Weller (1996) Bioscience 46:655-664). Global estimates of nitrogen export to coasts have been taken to be 25% of watershed input, based largely on northeastern U.S. observations (Galloway et al. (2004) Biogeochemistry 70:153-226; Boyer et al. (2006) Global Biogeochem Cycle 20:Art. No. GB1S91). We applied the N budgeting methodology developed for the International SCOPE Nitrogen project (Howarth et al. (1996) Biogeochemistry 35:75-139; Boyer et al. (2002) Biogeochemistry 57:137-169) to 12 watersheds in the southeastern U.S., and compared them with estimates of N export for 16 watersheds in the northeastern U.S. (Boyer et al. (2002) Biogeochemistry 57:137-169). In southeastern watersheds, average N export was only 9% of input, suggesting the need for downward revision of global estimates. The difference between northern and southern watersheds is not a function of the absolute value of N inputs, which spanned a comparable range and were positively related to export in both cases. Rather, the proportion of N exported was significantly related to average watershed temperature (% N export = 58.41
1468766|Sulfur is essential for the production of certain amino acids in plants. As amino acid sulfur is the major form of sulfur in trees, there is a strong relationship between organic S and organic N in tree tissue. Sulfur deficiencies occur in parts of southeastern Australia and northwestern North America, remote from pollutant inputs. Since biological S requirements of forests are modest (<latex>$<5\ \text{kg}\cdot \text{ha}^{-1}\ \text{yr}^{-1}$</latex> for net vegetative increment), however, atmospheric S inputs in polluted regions (10-80 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>) often exceed not only the forest ecosystem S requirement but also its ability to biologically accumulate S. There is some increase in the SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> -S content of forest vegetation in response to elevated atmospheric S inputs, but this capacity is apparently easily saturated. Soil SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> adsorption is often the dominant feature of S cycling in polluted ecosystems and often accounts for net ecosystem S accumulations.
1469776|Methane emission and rhizospheric CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation were studied in stands of Equisetum fluviatile, a common cryptogam in boreal lakes. The experiment was performed in mesocosms with organic sediment or sand bottoms under natural variation of temperature and light using the light-oxic - dark-anoxic chamber (LO/DA) technique. Net CH<sub>4</sub> emission from the organic sediment during the growing season varied between 3.4 and 19.0 mg m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, but from sand the net CH<sub>4</sub> emission was only 3-10% of that measured from the organic sediment. In the organic sediment net CH<sub>4</sub> emission was very significantly correlated with sediment temperature (r<sup>2</sup>=0.92). In the sand mesocosms the variation of net CH<sub>4</sub> emission was better correlated with the shoot biomass than with sediment temperature variation during the growing season, indicating that methanogens were severely limited by substrate availability and were probably dependent on substrates produced by E. fluviatile. The proportion of the methane oxidized of the potential CH<sub>4</sub> emission in summer did not differ significantly between the bottom types. The net CH<sub>4</sub> emission during the growing season as a proportion of the seasonal maximum of the shoot biomass was significantly higher in the organic sediment mesocosms (6.5%) than in sand (1.7%). The high CH<sub>4</sub> emissions observed from dense well-established E. fluviatile stands in the field appear to be more related to temperature-regulated turnover of detritus in the anaerobic sediment and less to CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation and seasonal variation in plant growth dynamics
1469785| Natural, unenriched Everglades wetlands are known to be limited by phosphorus (P) and responsive to P enrichment. However, whole-ecosystem evaluations of experimental P additions are rare in Everglades or other wetlands. We tested the response of the Everglades wetland ecosystem to continuous, low-level additions of P (0, 5, 15, and 30 g L<sup>-1</sup> above ambient) in replicate, 100 m flow-through flumes located in unenriched Everglades National Park. After the first six months of dosing, the concentration and standing stock of phosphorus increased in the surface water, periphyton, and flocculent detrital layer, but not in the soil or macrophytes. Of the ecosystem components measured, total P concentration increased the most in the floating periphyton mat (30 g L<sup>-1</sup>: mean = 1916 g P g<sup>-1</sup>, control: mean = 149 g P g<sup>-1</sup>), while the flocculent detrital layer stored most of the accumulated P (30 g L<sup>-1</sup>: mean = 1.732 g P m<sup>-2</sup>, control: mean = 0.769 g P m<sup>-2</sup>). Significant short-term responses of P concentration and standing stock were observed primarily in the high dose (30 g L<sup>-1</sup> above ambient) treatment. In addition, the biomass and estimated P standing stock of aquatic consumers increased in the 30 and 5 g L<sup>-1</sup> treatments. Alterations in P concentration and standing stock occurred only at the upstream ends of the flumes nearest to the point source of added nutrient. The total amount of P stored by the ecosystem within the flume increased with P dosing, although the ecosystem in the flumes retained only a small proportion of the P added over the first six months. These results indicate that oligotrophic Everglades wetlands respond rapidly to short-term, low-level P enrichment, and the initial response is most noticeable in the periphyton and flocculent detrital layer. 
1468958| Total suspended solids (TSS), particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) were measured over a two year period, 1983-1985, in the Orinoco River at Ciudad Bolvar, 450 km from its mouth. Additionally, samples of the main stem at other localities and main tributaries were included in the present study. The suspended sediment concentrations showed a peculiar pattern of temporal variations: two maxima (May-June and November) and two minima (March-April and August-September). The POC and PN concentrations fluctuated with the water discharge, and higher values were observed during the rising limb than during the falling limb of the hydrograph. As dry weight percent of solids, the values ranged between 0.84 and 9.06% for organic carbon and between 0.08 and 1.45% for total nitrogen. The carbon-nitrogen ratio in the sediment averaged 9.1. The major contribution of organic carbon and nitrogen in particulate form to the Orinoco main stem comes from the left margin tributaries, which have their headwater in the mountainous regions of the Andes. 
1469380|In two tidal freshwater marshes, methane emission, production and accumulation in the pore-water have been studied. The two sites differ in their dominant vegetation, i.e. reed and bulrush, and in their heights above sea level. The reed site was elevated in relation to the bulrush site and had higher rates of methane emission and production. It is argued that this difference in methane emission between sites was primarily due to a different effect of reed and bulrush plants on methane dynamics rather than methane oxidation related to tidal elevation. Methane emission showed strong seasonality related primarily to plant physiology and only secondarily to temperature. Two control sites at which vegetation was removed systematically had lower emission rates indicating an overall stimulating effect of plants on methane emission from tidal marshes. Flooding reduced methane emission, probably by blocking the primary sites of methane release in the lower part of the plant stems.
24715193|We evaluated the nighttime CO flux (ecosystem respiration) on Rishiri Island, located at the northern tip of Hokkaido, Japan, from 2009 to 2011, by using the relationship between atmospheric Rn and CO concentrations. The annual mean CO flux was 1.8 mol m s, with a maximum monthly mean in July (4.6  2.6 mol m s) and a broad minimum from December to March (0.33  0.29 mol m s). The annual mean was comparable to fluxes at the JapanFlux sites in northern Japan. During the season of snow cover (mid-December to early April), the CO flux was low (0.45  0.43 mol m s). Total annual respiration was estimated at 679  174 g cm, about 8 % of which occurred during the season of snow cover.
20055244|In two montane watersheds that receive minimal deposition of atmospheric nitrogen, 15-71% of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was bioavailable in stream water over a 2-year period. Discharge-weighted concentrations of bulk DON were between 102 and 135 g/l, and the C:N ratio differed substantially between humic and non-humic fractions of DON. Approximately 70% of DON export occurred during snowmelt, and 40% of that DON was biologically available to microbes in stream sediments. Concentrations of bioavailable DON in stream water were 2-16 times greater than dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) during the growing season, and bioavailable DON was depleted within 2-14 days during experimental incubations. Uptake of DON was influenced by the concentration of inorganic N in stream water, the concentration of non-humic DON in stream water, and the C:N ratio of the non-humic fraction of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Uptake of DON declined logarithmically as the concentration of inorganic N in stream water increased. Experimental additions of inorganic N also caused a decline in uptake of DON and net production of DON when the C:N ratio of non-humic DOM was high. This study indicates that the relative and absolute amount of bioavailable DON can vary greatly within and across years due to interactions between the availability of inorganic nutrients and composition of DOM. DOM has the potential to be used biotically at a high rate in nitrogen-poor streams, and it may be generated by heterotrophic microbes when DIN and labile DOM with low relative nitrogen content become abundant.
23359738|We present the first estimates of net anthropogenic nitrogen input (NANI) in European boreal catchments. In Swedish catchments, nitrogen (N) deposition is a major N input (3194%). Hence, we used two different N deposition inputs to calculate NANI for 36 major Swedish catchments. The relationship between riverine N export and NANI was strongest when using only oxidized deposition (NO y ) as atmospheric input (r 2 = 0.70) rather than total deposition (i.e., both oxidized and reduced nitrogen, NO y + NH x deposition, r 2 = 0.62). The y-intercept (NANI = 0) for the NANI calculated with NO y is significantly different from zero (p = 0.0042*) and indicates a background flux from the catchment of some 100 kg N km -2 year -1 in addition to anthropogenic inputs. This agrees with similar results from North American boreal catchments. The slope of the linear regressions was 0.25 for both N deposition inputs (NO y and NO y + NH x ), suggesting that on average, 25% of the anthropogenic N inputs is exported by rivers to the Baltic Sea. Agricultural catchments in central and southern Sweden have increased their riverine N export up to tenfold compared to the inferred background flux. Although the relatively unperturbed northernmost catchments receive significant N loads from atmospheric deposition, these catchments do not show significantly elevated riverine N export. The fact that nitrogen export in Swedish catchments appears to be higher in proportion to NANI at higher loads suggests that N retention may be saturating as loading rates increase. In northern and western Sweden the export of nitrogen is largely controlled by the hydraulic load, i.e., the riverine discharge normalized by water surface area, which has units of distance time -1 . Besides hydraulic load the percent total forest cover also affects the nitrogen export primarily in the northern and western catchments.
1468541| The STG method presented here is a sample approach facilitating the characterization of biogenic organic materials. Pre-dried (130 C) and grounded (<0.5 mm) samples were heated in a muffle furnace at 280 C for 6 h and subsequently at 520 C for 6 h. The weight loss in the temperature range, 130-280 C (PI) and 280-520 C (PII), provided an index (Rp) defined as, Rp = PII/(PI + PII). Plant materials rich in structural carbohydrates generally showed a Rp index around 0.3, whereas Rp for animal tissues rich in proteins usually were around 0.6. A general relationship between Rp and C:N for living biogenic organic matter, ranging from leaves of terrestrial origin to marine invertebrate tissue, was described by the equation: Rp = 0.791  (C: N)<sup>-0.246</sup> (n = 13, r<sup>2</sup>=0.946). During biological decomposition of composting barley straw, Rp increased from 0.17 to 0.37 and C:N decreased from 87 to 16. A similar Rp-C:N pattern was observed with depth in the upper 2 cm of an organic poor marine lagoon sediment (Rp increased from 0.43 to 0.47; C:N decreased from 8.4 to 7.7); indicating that microbial protein synthesis may have occurred with depth in this layer. The observed increase in both Rp and C:N with depth from 2 to 8 cm (Rp increased from 0.47 to 0.52; C:N increased from 7.7 to 10.3) suggested that humification may predominate in this zone. Accordingly, humic acids are found to have a Rp as high as 0.64. The Rp-C:N relationship appears to be a powerful two-dimensional tool applicable to characterize the bulk composition of various biogenic organic materials at different stages of decomposition. 
20456588|We sampled two streams in southwestern Nova Scotia from 1983 to 2004 and one stream from 1992 to 2004 for total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) in order to investigate if changes in catchment exports could be determined over the sampling periods, and if so what were the controlling factors. We first show that early TOC measurements underestimated concentrations due to analytical shortcomings and then produce a correction to adjust values to more accurate levels. Our trend results showed that TOC concentrations decreased in the two streams with the longest record, from 1980 to 1992 when acid deposition to the area decreased most rapidly, and have remained constant since then. TOC exports only decreased at one site over the total sampling period. As expected, we also measured seasonal changes in exports, with the autumn period showing TOC and TN exports as high as during spring snowmelt. We found that only 24% of deposition N is exported from the larger catchments, most of it in organic form, while the smallest catchment exported 16%. We also show a constant increase in TN from 1994 to the present at all three sites sampled. Our results do not support the hypothesis that reductions in sulfur acidification lead to increases in catchment organic carbon mobilization to streams.
1468777| Atmospheric depostion and stream discharge and solutes were measured for three years (September 1984 - August 1987) in two mixed conifer watersheds in Sequoia National Park, in the southern Sierra Nevada of California. The Log Creek watershed (50 ha, 2067-2397 m elev.) is drained by a perennial stream, while Tharp's Creek watershed (13 ha, 2067-2255 m elev.) contains an intermittent stream. Dominant trees in the area include Abies concolor (white fir), Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia), A. magnifica (red fir), and Pinus lambertiana (sugar pine). Bedrock is predominantly granite and granodiorite, and the soils are mostly Pachic Xerumbrepts. Over the three year period, sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), and chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) were the major anions in bulk precipitation with volume-weighted average concentrations of 12.6, 12.3 and 10.0 eq/1, respectively. Annual inputs of NO<sub>3</sub>-N, NH<sub>4</sub>-N and SO<sub>4</sub>-S from wet deposition were about 60 to 75% of those reported from bulk deposition collectors. Discharge from the two watersheds occurs primarily during spring snowmelt. Solute exports from Log and Tharp's Creeks were dominated by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>, while H<sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> outputs were relatively small. Solute concentrations were weakly correlated with instantaneous stream flow for all solutes (<latex>$\text{r}^{2}<0.2$</latex>) except HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (Log Cr. r<sup>2</sup>=0.72; Tharp's Cr. r<sup>2</sup>=0.38), Na<sup>+</sup> (Log Cr. r<sup>2</sup>=0.56; Tharp's Cr. r<sup>2</sup>=0.47), and silicate (Log Cr. r<sup>2</sup>=0.71; Tharp's Cr. r<sup>2</sup>=0.49). Mean annual atmospheric contributions of NO<sub>3</sub>-N (1.6 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), NH<sub>4</sub>-N (1.7 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), and SO<sub>4</sub>-S (1.8 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), which are associated with acidic deposition, greatly exceed hydrologic losses. Annual watershed yields (expressed as eq ha<sup>-1</sup>) of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exceeded by factors of 2.5 to 37 the annual atmospheric deposition of H<sup>+</sup>. 
1469604|The effect of flooding on methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) fluxes was studied through the construction of an experimental reservoir in a boreal forest wetland at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario. Prior to flooding, the peatland surface was a small source of CH<sub>4</sub> to the atmosphere (1.0 SD of 2.3 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). After flooding, CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes from the submerged peat surface increased to 64 68 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. CH<sub>4</sub> bubbles within the submerged peat caused about 1/3 of the peat to float. Fluxes from these floating peat islands were much higher (440 350 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) than from both the pre-flood (undisturbed) and the post-flood (submerged) peat surfaces. The high fluxes of CH<sub>4</sub> from the floating peat surfaces may be explained by a number of factors known to affect the production and consumption of CH<sub>4</sub> in peat. In floating peat, however, these factors are particularly enhanced and include decreased oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub> due to the loss of aerobic habitat normally found above the water table of undisturbed peat and to increased peat temperatures. The extremely high fluxes associated with newly lifted peat may decrease as the islands age. However, CH<sub>4</sub> flux rates from floating peat islands that were several years old still far exceeded those from undisturbed peat surfaces and from the water surface of a newly created reservoir.
1469108|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOC export are studied during storms to examine the relationship between DOC concentration and stream discharge and to assess the importance of storms on DOC export. Storms were monitored in seven subcatchments within two small watersheds (Harp 4-21 and Harp 3A) on the Precambrian Shield in Central Ontario, Canada. Stream DOC concentrations increase during storms by as much as 100% and 410% in Harp 3A and Harp 4-21 respectively. The seasonal regression between DOC and stream discharge is significant in subcatchments without wetlands (<latex>$\text{r}^{2}>0.7$</latex>) but is not significant in the two subcatchments with small wetland areas (<latex>$\text{r}^{2}<0.06$</latex>). On average, regressions based on weekly data yield accurate estimates of DOC export but the variation in regressions among individual storms and the small number of high DOC samples result in uncertainties of more than 30% in DOC export. The period-weighted calculation of DOC export from weekly data underestimates export by 14% and 22% in Harp 3A and Harp 4-21 respectively. Storms were responsible for 57% to 68% of the DOC export in the autumn and 29% to 40% of the DOC export in the spring. A single large storm accounted for 31% of the autumn DOC export in Harp 3A. The importance of individual storms for DOC export and the variation in the relationship between DOC and stream discharge among storms make it difficult to predict the effects of climate change on DOC export and DOC concentrations.
1469265|Temporal and longitudinal variations in the chemistry of two tributary streams of Woods Lake in the Adirondack Mountains of New York were monitored before and after a watershed CaCO<sub>3</sub> application. One subcatchment of the lake had a large beaver pond and wetland at its headwaters, while the second was free-flowing. Treatment of both subcatchments with CaCO<sub>3</sub> resulted in an immediate increase in acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. The extent and duration of the response to the treatment were greater in the wetland-impacted stream. Aluminum was retained and complexed with organic solutes generated within the beaver-pond. In the free-flowing stream, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentration increased significantly after the manipulation; this pattern was not evident in the wetland-impacted stream. Net retention of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was evident in the beaver pond prior to and following treatment, and this response was enhanced after the watershed liming. Comparisons of beaver pond inlet/outlet concentrations, mass balance calculations, and in-pond profiles of chemical parameters revealed patterns of retention of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Al, and release of Fe<sup>2+</sup>, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the wetland during the summer before CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment. Post-treatment releases of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the near-sediment zone in the beaver pond corresponded to anoxic periods in mid- to late-summer and under ice in winter. These findings demonstrate the importance of increased microbial processing of organic matter, along with high partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (Pco<sub>2</sub>) in facilitating the dissolution of the applied CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Dissolved silica (H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) was retained in the wetland during the summer prior to treatment but was released after the manipulation. This phenomenon may reflect the dissolution of diatom frustules or silicate minerals in the wetland at higher pH and DOC concentrations. Within two years of the CaCO<sub>3</sub> treatment 60% of the CaCO<sub>3</sub> applied to the beaver pond and surrounding wetland was dissolved and transported from the pond, in contrast to only 2.2% of the CaCO<sub>3</sub> applied to the upland subcatchment draining into the wetland. These results, coupled with high quantities of exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> found in sediments and on Sphagnum mosses in the pond, demonstrate the importance of hydrologic source areas and wetlands in facilitating the dissolution of added CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and in regulating the production of chemical species important in ANC generation.
24715114|Consideration of natural formation of organochlorine compounds in soils is necessary in radioecology in order to understand chlorine radioisotope (Cl) cycling in various environments for safety assessment purposes, but also in ecotoxicology because certain chlorinated organics in soils are toxic compounds. On the other hand, occurrence of organic chlorine in soils is poorly documented, especially in non-forest ecosystems. We measured total and organic chlorine concentrations in 51 French surface soils sampled from grassland, arable and forest sites on a national scale (French soil quality monitoring network) in order to characterize the variability of organic chlorine concentrations for these different land uses. While previous studies reported that the chlorination of soil organic matter is responsible for chlorine retention in temperate forest ecosystems, this study shows that the non-extractable organohalogen pool accounts for the majority (>80 % on an average) of the total measurable chlorine in grassland and agricultural soils. This suggests that natural chlorination is a widespread phenomenon in all kinds of soils. A multiple linear regression analysis performed on the dataset indicated that retention of organochlorine in soils is related to the organic carbon content, Cl input and soil pH.
20519821|The production of reactive nitrogen worldwide has more than doubled in the last century because of human activities and population growth. Advances in our understanding of the nitrogen cycle and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on regional to global scales is largely hindered by the paucity of information about nitrogen inputs from human activities in fast-developing regions of the world such as the tropics. In this paper, we estimate nitrogen inputs and outputs in Brazil, which is the world's largest tropical country. We determined that the N cycle is increasingly controlled by human activities rather than natural processes. Nitrogen inputs to Brazil from human activities practically doubled from 1995 to 2002, mostly because of nitrogen production through biological fixation in agricultural systems. This is in contrast to industrialized countries of the temperate zone, where fertilizer application and atmospheric deposition are the main sources of anthropogenic nitrogen. In Brazil, the production of soybean crops over an area of less than 20 million ha, was responsible for about 3.2 Tg N or close to one-third of the N inputs from anthropogenic sources in 2002. Moreover, cattle pastures account for almost 70% of the estimated 280  10 ha of agricultural land in Brazil and potentially fix significant amounts of N when well managed, further increasing the importance of biological nitrogen fixation in the nitrogen budget. Much of these anthropogenic inputs occur in the Brazilian savannah region (Cerrado), while more urbanized regions such as the state of So Paulo also have high rates of nitrogenous fertilizer inputs. In the Amazon, rates of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs are relatively low, but continuing conversion of natural forests into cattle pasture or secondary forests potentially add a significant amount of new nitrogen to Brazil given the vast area of the region. Better measurements of biological fixation rates in Brazil are necessary for improving the nitrogen budgets, especially at a more refined spatial scale.
1469146|Solid phase controls of dissolved aluminum chemistry of soil and surface waters were investigated in several pristine, low order Precambrian shield catchments. Soil extraction and leaching experiments were conducted to quantify the various pools of solid phase soil aluminum and their relative mobility. Reactive soil aluminum (exchangeable + organic + amorphous forms), comprised < 20% of the total soil aluminum. Leaching soils with pH 3.0 HCl solutions indicated that Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> extractable aluminum (largely organic complexes) was the most mobile form of reactive soil aluminum. Aluminum hydroxide from vermiculate interlayers was also mobilized from all soil horizons and its contribution to dissolved aluminum increased with soil depth. Runoff and soil waters from organic LFH and Ah soil horizons were highly undersaturated with respect to Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> solid-phases. Several natural bedrock surfaces (metagranites) covered with moss or lichen were leached with HCl solutions. Significantly more aluminum was removed from bedrock surfaces colonized with the moss Racomitrium microcarpon compared to that of the lichen-covered surfaces. Aluminum removal increased dramatically as the acidity of the leaching solution increased to pH 3.0. Leachates solutions collected from bedrock surfaces became increasingly undersaturated with respect to Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> minerals at lower pH values. Aluminum solubility appears to be controlled by equilibrium with organic complexation, modified by kinetically constrained dissolution of interlayer aluminum.
1469898|The exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum has replaced thousands of hectares of native perennial vegetation in semi-arid ecosystems of the western United States. Inorganic N availability and production were compared in soil from monodominant patches of Bromus tectorum, the perennial bunch-grass Elymus elymoides, and the shrub Artemisia tridentata, in Curlew Valley, a salt-desert shrub site in Northern Utah. Bromus-dominated soil had greater %N in the top 10 cm than Artemisia or Elymus-dominated soils. As determined by spring isotope-dilution assays, gross mineralization and nitrification rates were higher in Bromus-dominated than Artemisia-dominated soils, but gross rates of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> consumption were also higher. Litterbags had greater mass loss and N mineralization when buried in Bromus stands than in Artemisia stands, indicating the soil environment under the annual grass promotes decomposition. As determined by nitrification potential assays, nitrifier populations were higher under Bromus than under Artemisia and Elymus. Soil inorganic N concentrations were similar among vegetation types in the spring, but NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> accumulated under Bromus once it had senesced. An in situ net mineralization assay conducted in autumn indicated that germinating Bromus seedlings are a strong sink for soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and that net nitrification is inherently low in soils under Artemisia and Elymus. Results of the study suggest that differences in plant uptake and the soil environment promote greater inorganic N availability under Bromus than under perennial species at the site.
20456468|Previous work on the genetic diversity of Phaeocystis used ribosomal DNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses to show that there is substantial inter- and intraspecific variation within the genus. First attempts to trace the biogeographical history of strains in Antarctic coastal waters were based on a comparison of ITS sequences. To gain deeper insights into the population structure and bloom dynamics of this microalga it is necessary to quantify the genetic diversity within populations of P. antarctica from different locations (i.e., each of the three major gyres in the Antarctic continental waters) and to calculate the gene flow between them. Here we describe methods to quantify genetic diversity and our preliminary results for P. antarctica in comparison to two other colonial species: P. globosa and P. pouchetii. For this study of genetic diversity, two fingerprinting techniques were used. First, amplified fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were established as a pre-screening tool to assess clone diversity and to select divergent clones prior to physiological investigations. Second, the more-powerful microsatellite markers were established to assess population structure and biogeography more accurately. Results show differences in the AFLP patterns between isolates of P. antarctica from different regions, and that a wide variety of microsatellite motifs could be obtained from the three Phaeocystis species.
1469887|Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is approached differently by terrestrial hydrogeologists and marine scientists, including whether to incorporate recirculated seawater with freshwater in the definition. This paper focuses on the major hydrogeologic modeling/calculational methods, what component of SGD they quantify and on what scale. It then compares the modeling methods to direct measurement and geochemical techniques used by marine scientists. Hydrogeologic modeling methods focus primarily on freshwater, but recirculated seawater can be examined with density-dependent, solute transport numerical modeling. Direct physical measurements and geochemical tracers performed in the marine environment can quantify fresh, brackish, or seawater fluxes, so that they are not always comparable to the results of modeling. Because of differences in the geochemistry (nutrients and other dissolved species) of fresh and saline waters, for many applications it may be necessary to distinguish between the fresh and recirculated seawater components of SGD.
40980876|In Mediterranean ecosystems the effect of aboveground and belowground environmental factors on soil microbial biomass and nutrient immobilization-release cycles may be conditioned by the distinctive seasonal pattern of the Mediterraneantype climates. We studied the effects of season, canopy cover and soil depth on microbial C, N and P in soils of two Mediterranean forests using the fumigation-extraction procedure. Average microbial values recorded were 820 g C g , 115 g N g and 19 g P g , which accounted for 2.7, 4.7 and 8.8% of the total pools in the surface soil, respectively. Microbial N and P pools were about 10 times higher than the inorganic N and P fractions available for plants. Microbial values differed between forest sites but in each site they were similar across seasons. Both microbial and inorganic N and P showed maximum values in spring and minimum values in summer, which were positively correlated with soil moisture. Significant differences in soil microbial properties among canopy cover types were observed in the surface soil but only under favourable environmental conditions (spring) and not during summer. Soil depth affected microbial contents which decreased twofold from surface to subsurface soil. Microbial nutrient ratios (C/N, C/P and N/P) varied with seasons and soil depth. Soil moisture regime, which was intimately related to seasonally, emerged as a potential key factor for microbial biomass growth in the studied forests. Our research shows that under a Mediterranean-type climate the interaction among season, vegetation type and structure and soil properties affect microbial nutrient immobilization and thus could influence the biogeochemical cycles of C, N and P in Mediterranean forest ecosystems.
23359711|Bacterial species associated with the dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)-producing phytoplankton Scrippsiella trochoidea were cultured and identified, with the aim of establishing their ability to metabolise DMSP, dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Results demonstrate that of the cultivable bacteria only -Proteobacteria were capable of producing DMS from DMSP. The concentration of DMSP was shown to affect the amount of DMS produced. Lower DMSP concentrations (1.5 mol dm -3 ) were completely assimilated, whereas higher concentrations (10 mol dm -3 ) resulted in increasing amounts of DMS being produced. By contrast to the restricted set of bacteria that metabolised DMSP,  70% of the bacterial isolates were able to 'consume' DMS. However, 98-100% of the DMS removed was accounted for as DMSO. Notably, a number of these bacteria would only oxidise DMS in the presence of glucose, including members of the -Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The observations from this study, coupled with published field data, identify DMS oxidation to DMSO as a major transformation pathway for DMS, and we speculate that the fate of DMS and DMSP in the field are tightly coupled to the available carbon produced by phytoplankton.
1469020|The fluxes and transformations of nitrogen (N) were investigated from 1985 through 1987 at the Emerald Lake watershed (ELW), a 120 ha high-elevation catchment located in the southern Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Up to 90% of annual wet deposition of N was stored in the seasonal snowpack; NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were released from storage in the form of an ionic pulse, where the first fraction of meltwater draining from the snowpack had concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> as high as 28  eq L<sup>-1</sup> compared to bulk concentrations of <latex>$<5\ \mu \text{eq L}^{-1}$</latex> in the snowpack. The soil reservoir of organic N (81 keq ha<sup>-1</sup>) was about ten times the N storage in litter and biomass (12 keq ha<sup>-1</sup>). Assimilation of N by vegetation was balanced by the release of N from soil mineralization, nitrification, and litter decay. Mineralization and nitrification processes produced 1.1 keq ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> of inorganic N, about 31/2 times the loading of N from wet and dry deposition. Less than 1% of the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in wet and dry deposition was exported from the basin as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Biological assimilation was primarily responsible for retention of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the basin, releasing one mode of H<sup>+</sup> for every mole of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> retained and neutralizing about 25% of the annual acid neutralizing capacity produced by mineral weathering in the basin. Nitrate concentrations in stream waters reached an annual peak during the first part of snowmelt runoff, with maximum concentrations in stream water of 20  eq L<sup>-1</sup>, more than 4 times the volume-weighted mean annual concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in wet deposition. This annual peak in stream water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was consistent with the release of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from the snowpack in the form of an ionic pulse; however soil processes occurring underneath the winter snowpack were another potential source of this NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Concentrations of stream water NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> during the summer growing season were always near or below detection limits (0.5  eq L<sup>-1</sup>).
1469436|Uptake of <sup>15</sup>N labelled NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> by two Sphagnum mosses on a raised bog in north east Scotland was measured at different times of the year. In a field experiment, fortnightly additions of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> at natural abundance, equivalent to 3 g N m<sup>-2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, were made over 14 months to cores of Sphagnum capillifolium occupying hummocks and S. recurvum colonizing hollows. Pre-harvested cores were treated with <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub> two weeks before harvesting and <sup>15</sup>N abundance determined for the total N in the moss, inorganic and dissolved organic N (DON) in the moss water and extractable inorganic, organic and microbial N in the underlying peat. The proportion of added <sup>15</sup>N taken up by the mosses two weeks after each addition averaged 72% and ranged between 11 and 100%, tending to be least during October when the rising water table reached the surface, particularly for S. recurvum. A small proportion of the <sup>15</sup>N was detected in the moss water as NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (0.01%) and as DON (0.03%) and on occasions a large proportion remained unaccounted for. In waters from S. capillifolium, DON was proportional to the amount of inorganic N added, but this was not the case for S. recurvum. Little or no <sup>15</sup>N was detected in the underlying peat partly because of the large size and variability of the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, DON and microbial N pools.
1468685|Anthropogenic activities on coastal watersheds increase nutrient concentrations of groundwater. As groundwater travels downslope it transports these nutrients toward the adjoining coastal water. The resulting nutrient loading rates can be significant because nutrient concentrations in coastal groundwaters may be several orders of magnitude greater than those of receiving coastal waters. Groundwater-borne nutrients are most subject to active biogeochemical transformations as they course through the upper 1 m or so of bottom sediments. There conditions favor anaerobic processes such as denitrification, as well as other mechanisms that either sequester or release nutrients. The relative importance of advective vs. regenerative pathways of nutrient supply may result in widely different rates of release of nutrients from sediments. The relative activity of denitrifiers also may alter the ratio of N to P released to overlying waters, and hence affect which nutrient limits growth of producers. The consequences of nutrient (particularly nitrate) loading include somewhat elevated nutrient concentrations in the watercolumn, increased growth of macroalgae and phytoplankton, reduction of seagrass beds, and reductions of the associated fauna. The decline in animals occurs because of habitat changes and because of the increased frequency of anoxic events prompted by the characteristically high respiration rates found in enriched waters.
1469934|Monitoring programs of ion concentrations and fluxes in semi-natural ecosystems are confronted with the task to gain as much information as possible with simultaneously minimizing costs and efforts. The aim of this study was (i) to assess how much of the heterogeneity of solution concentrations is lost because of temporal integration of measurements and (ii) to estimate the error in ion fluxes due to temporal integration. High resolution measurements (daily interval) of ion concentrations (sulfate, nitrate, chloride, pH and EC) in throughfall, soil solutions and runoff at the catchment Lehstenbach (Fichtelgebirge, Northeast Bavaria, Germany) were compared over a two year period with the reference monitoring program (biweekly measurement interval). Evaluation of the maximum temporal heterogeneity of ion concentrations in throughfall, soil solution and runoff (expressed as minimum, maximum, median and 25-75% percentile) did not result in an overall higher heterogeneity of the high resolution measurements compared to the reference program. The calculation of runoff fluxes from the reference data (biweekly concentration) resulted in significant errors of up to 25% for time periods < 1 year (high resolution data was considered the "true" value and set as 100%). However, errors became minor (< 10%) if longer time periods were considered. The suitability of different interpolation methods to upscale biweekly concentration data for the calculation of runoff fluxes was evaluated in this study. We concluded for the monitoring programs at the Lehstenbach catchment that a biweekly measurement interval seemed to be suitable to capture the heterogeneity of ion concentrations and fluxes (and thus temporal trends). In comparison, high resolution measurements with a daily measurement interval were higher in cost, work and time resources and had a relatively low information gain. While the introduced methods are applicable in all monitoring programs, conclusions on temporal resolution of measurements are most likely not valid for systems where ion concentrations have a low autocorrelation length (e.g., agricultural or urban systems with nitrate or pesticide treatment; tropical systems with extreme temperature or hydrological events).
1469731|Productivity and carbon (C) storage in many mature tropical forests are considered phosphorus (P) limited because of advanced soil weathering. However, disturbance can shift limitation away from P and toward nitrogen (N) because of disproportionately large N losses associated with its mobility relative to P in ecosystems. This shift was illustrated by model analyses in which large disturbances including timber extraction and slash-burn were simulated in a P-limited tropical forest. Re-accumulation of ecosystem C during secondary forest growth was initially N-limited, but long term limitation reverted to P. Mechanisms controlling shifts between N and P limitation included: (1) N volatility during slash combustion produced ash that increased soil solution P more than N, (2) a wide N:P ratio in residual fuel and belowground necromass relative to soil organic matter (SOM) N:P produced a simultaneous P sink and N source during decomposition, (3) a supplemental (to aerosol deposition) external N source via biological N fixation. Redistribution of N and P from low C:nutrient SOM to high C:nutrient vegetation was the most important factor contributing to the resilience of ecosystem C accumulation during secondary growth. Resilience was diminished when multiple harvest and re-growth cycles depleted SOM. Phosphorus losses in particular resulted in long-term reductions of C storage capacity because of slow re-supply rates via deposition and the absence of other external sources. Sensitivity analyses limiting the depth of microbially active SOM in soil profiles further illustrated the importance of elements stored in SOM to ecosystem resilience, pointing to a need for better knowledge on the functioning of deeply buried SOM.
1468863|Fertilization of a small lake with ammonium chloride for four years as part of a eutrophication experiment caused it to acidify to pH values as low as 4.6. Implications for acidification of lakes via precipitation polluted with ammonium compounds are discussed. When phosphate was supplied with the ammonium, biological nitrogen uptake, apparently by phytoplankton, was the main mechanism causing acidification. When ammonium was applied without phosphate, it accumulated to high concentrations in solution, after which nitrification caused rapid acidification. In both cases, the whole-lake efficiency of acidification was low, averaging about 13% of the potential acidification of supplied ammonium chloride (Table 2). Subsequent application of phosphate plus sodium nitrate for two years caused the pH of the lake to increase. The efficiency of alkalinization was higher than for acidification, averaging 69% of the potential alkalinization of the supplied sodium nitrate.
20456526|This study investigates the spatial distribution of organic carbon (C) in free stable microaggregates (20-250 m; not encapsulated within macroaggregates) from one Inceptisol and two Oxisols in relation to current theories of the mechanisms of their formation. Two-dimensional micro- and nano-scale observations using synchrotron-based Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy yielded maps of the distribution of C amounts and chemical forms. Carbon deposits were unevenly distributed within microaggregates and did not show any discernable gradients between interior and exterior of aggregates. Rather, C deposits appeared to be patchy within the microaggregates. In contrast to the random location of C, there were micron-scale patterns in the spatial distribution of aliphatic C-H (2922 cm), aromatic C=C and N-H (1589 cm) and polysaccharide C-O (1035 cm). Aliphatic C forms and the ratio of aliphatic C/aromatic C were positively correlated (r of 0.66-0.75 and 0.27-0.59, respectively) to the amount of O-H on kaolinite surfaces (3695 cm), pointing at a strong role for organo-mineral interactions in C stabilization within microaggregates and at a possible role for molecules containing aliphatic C-H groups in such interactions. This empirical relationship was supported by nanometer-scale observations using NEXAFS which showed that the organic matter in coatings on mineral surfaces had more aliphatic and carboxylic C with spectral characteristics resembling microbial metabolites than the organic matter of the entire microaggregate. Our observations thus support models of C stabilization in which the initially dominant process is adsorption of organics on mineral surfaces rather than occlusion of organic debris by adhering clay particles.
20456528|Soil organic matter (SOM) is often separated by physical means to simplify a complex matrix into discrete fractions. A frequent approach to isolating two or more fractions is based on differing particle densities and uses a high density liquid such as sodium polytungstate (SPT). Soil density fractions are often interpreted as organic matter pools with different carbon (C) turnover times, ranging from years to decades or centuries, and with different functional roles for C and nutrient dynamics. In this paper, we discuss the development and mechanistic basis of common density-based methods for dividing soil into distinct organic matter fractions. Further, we directly address the potential effects of dispersing soil in a high density salt solution on the recovered fractions and implications for data interpretation. Soil collected from forested sites at H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon and Bousson Experimental Forest, Pennsylvania was separated into light and heavy fractions by floatation in a 1.6 g cm solution of SPT. Mass balance calculations revealed that between 17% and 26% of the original bulk soil C and N content was mobilized and subsequently discarded during density fractionation for both soils. In some cases, the light isotope was preferentially mobilized during density fractionation. During a year-long incubation, mathematically recombined density fractions respired 40% less than the bulk soil at both sites and light fraction (LF) did not always decompose more than the heavy fraction (HF). Residual amounts of tungsten (W) present even in well-rinsed fractions were enough to reduce microbial respiration by 27% compared to the control in a 90-day incubation of <tex-math>$\text{O}_{\text{a}}$</tex-math> material. However, residual W was nearly eliminated by repeated leaching over the year-long incubation, and is not likely the primary cause of the difference in respiration between summed fractions and bulk soil. Light fraction at Bousson, a deciduous site developed on Alfisols, had a radiocarbon-based mean residence time (MRT) of 2.7 or 89 years, depending on the interpretation of the radiocarbon model, while HF was 317 years. In contrast, both density fractions from H. J. Andrews, a coniferous site developed on andic soils, had approximately the same MRT (117 years and 93 years for LF and HF). At H. J. Andrews the organic matter lost during density separation had a short MRT (19 years) and can account for the difference in respired CO between the summed fractions and the bulk soil. Recognition and consideration of the effects of the density separation procedure on the recovered fractions will help prevent misinterpretation and deepen our understanding of the specific role of the recovered organic matter fractions in the ecological context of the soil studied.
40800599|Peatlands are important to global carbon (C) sequestration and surface water acid-base status, both of which are affected by peatland alkalinity and acidity cycling. Relationships among sulfate (SO), nitrate (NO), organic acids (OA), base cations (i.e., Ca , Mg , K, and Na), proton (H) acidity, and bicarbonate (HCO) alkalinity were investigated in an intermediate fen peatland in northern Ontario during 2004 (an average precipitation year) and 2005 (a dry summer). Potential evapotranspiration was higher and the water table, groundwater input from the uplands, and runoff were lower during 2005. Net inputs of base cations, HCO, SO, and OA, and to a lesser degree NO, were lower during the drier year, mainly due to lower groundwater transfer to the fen. Fen porewater HCO concentration and net output were also lower in the drier year, whereas Ca , Mg , and SO concentrations and net output were higher. During the climatically average year, N immobilization, carbonic acid (H CO ) dissociation, and OA dissociation were equally important H -producing reactions. Peat cation exchange accounted for 50% of the H sink, while SO reduction and denitrification accounted for an additional 20 and 25% of the H sink, respectively. During the dry year, S oxidation accounted for 55% of the H net production, while that for HCO dissociation was 70% lower than that during the climatically average year. Peat cation exchange consumed three times the acidity, and accounted for 92% of the H consumption during the dry year compared to the climatically average year. This was consistent with a three-fold higher net base cation export from the fen during the dry year. Based on the study results, a conceptual model was developed that describes the role of acidity formation and its implications to intermediate fen acidification.
24715324|Organic matter (OM) in loess-paleosol sequences is used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, based e.g. on stable carbon isotope composition. Loess OM (LOM) is assumed to derive from synsedimentary vegetation, i.e. predominantly grass. However, low organic C contents make LOM prone to postsedimentary contamination. It was the aim of this study to reveal (1) whether OM of the loess sequence at Nussloch (SW Germany) was altered by postsedimentary input, (2) to which depth, and (3) from which source vegetation this younger OM derives. Therefore, the alkane composition of LOM was compared to that of potential source OM for postsedimentary contamination: recent soil, vegetation growing on the loess sequence, calcified roots (rhizoliths) which derive from postsedimentary deep-rooting plants but not from recent vegetation, and loess in direct vicinity of these former roots. Alkane molecular proxies including carbon preference index and average chain length revealed that grass biomass was the source of soil and LOM. The latter was, except for the uppermost 0.6 m of loess, not affected by pedogenic processes. Further, recent vegetation did not contribute to OM within and loess adjacent to rhizoliths, which were formed under native tree and/or shrub vegetation prior to agricultural use. Strongest degradation of LOM and large amounts of microbial derived OM were found in rhizoloess, indicating former rhizosphere processes. Molecular proxies indicate that overprinting of LOM even in loess distant to former roots cannot be excluded. Therefore, paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on loess Corg should be regarded with caution.
24715200|A series of eight watersheds on the Pacific coast of Panama where conversion of mature lowland wet forest to pastures by artisanal burning provided watershed-scale experimental units with a wide range of forest cover (23, 29, 47, 56, 66, 73, 73, 91, and 92 %). We used these watersheds as a landscape-scale experiment to assess effects of degree of deforestation on within-watershed retention and hydrological export of atmospheric inputs of nutrients. Retention was estimated by comparing rainfall nutrient concentrations (volume-weighted to allow for evapotranspiration) to concentrations in freshwater reaches of receiving streams. Retention of rain-derived nutrients in these Panama watersheds averaged 77, 85, 80, and 62 % for nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic N, and phosphate, respectively. Retention of rain-derived inorganic nitrogen, however, depended on watershed cover: retention of nitrate and ammonium in pasture-dominated watersheds was 95 and 98 %, while fully forested watersheds retained 65 and 80 % of atmospheric nitrate and ammonium inputs. Watershed forest cover did not affect retention of dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphate. Exports from more forested watersheds yielded DIN/P near 16, while pasture-dominated watersheds exported N/P near 2. The differences in magnitude of exports and ratios suggest that deforestation in these Panamanian forests results in exports that affect growth of plants and algae in the receiving stream and estuarine ecosystems. Watershed retention of dissolved inorganic nitrogen calculated from wet plus dry atmospheric deposition varied from 90 % in pasture- to 65 % in forest-dominated watersheds, respectively. Discharges of DIN to receiving waters from the watersheds therefore rose from 10 % of atmospheric inputs for pasture-dominated watersheds, to about 35 % of atmospheric inputs for fully forested watersheds. These results from watersheds with no agriculture or urbanization, but different conversion of forest to pasture by burning, show significant, deforestation-dependent retention within tropical watersheds, but also ecologically significant, and deforestation-dependent, exports that are biologically significant because of the paucity of nutrients in receiving tropical stream and coastal waters.
40343749|The northern Loess Plateau is an important cropping-pastoral ecotone and wind-water erosion crisscross region in China, but the distribution of soil organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in different land uses across this vulnerable ecoregion is not well understood. This study was carried out to determine the distribution patterns of soil organic C, N and P in native grassland and in two woody lands (Chinese Pine land and Korshinsk Peashrub land) that were established on the native grassland 28 years ago. In the north part of the Loess Plateau, the concentrations of soil organic C, N and P were lower than in the southern Loess Plateau either across or within the land use patterns. The concentrations and stocks of organic C and total  were significantly decreased in Chinese Pine and Korshinsk Peashrub lands compared with those in native grassland in the surface 0-40 cm soil layer, where more than 70% of the roots were distributed. The decreases in organic C in 0-40 cm soil layers were 2.6 and 3.0 Mg C ha (26.3 and 27.7%) by Chinese Pine and Korshrinsk Peashrub, while those of total  were 0.6 and 0.4 Mg N ha (31.5 and 17.2%), respectively, compared with native grassland. Both concentration and stock of total  varied only slightly with land use. The findings suggested that the conversion of natural grass into Chinese Pine and Korshinsk Peashrub resulted in decreased soil organic C and total N in the surface 0 to 40 cm soil layer of the northern Loess Plateau. Our results further indicated that a combination of low temperatures, little precipitation and large soil degradation impede increasing C and N stocks by afforestation, and the afforestation on grassland should be viewed very critically in such areas.
23359729|Observed increases in the mineralization rate of labile organic carbon (LOC) in the presence of black carbon (BC) have led to speculation that corresponding decreases in non-pyrogenic (i.e. non-BC) soil organic carbon (npSOC) could significantly reduce or negate the C sequestration benefit of BC in soils. Here we show that the potential effect of an increased LOC decomposition rate on long-term npSOC stocks is negligible, even when using assumptions that would favour large losses, potentially causing no more than 34 % loss of npSOC over 100 years if 50 % of above-ground crop residues were converted to BC annually. Conversely, if the BC-stimulated enhanced stabilization of npSOC that has been observed in laboratory trials is extrapolated to the long-term, it would greatly increase soil carbon stocks by 3060 %. Annual additions of BC derived from crop residues would increase total SOC (including both BC and npSOC) by an amount five times greater than the potential increase from enhanced stabilization and an order of magnitude greater than losses of npSOC caused by annual removals of biomass to provide BC feedstock.
40980888|Fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) may play an important role for losses of C and N from the soils of forest ecosystems, especially under conditions of high precipitation. We studied DOC and DON fluxes and concentrations in relation to precipitation intensity in a subtropical montane Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana forest in Taiwan. Our objective was, to quantify DOC and DON fluxes and to understand the role of high precipitation for DOC and DON export in this ecosystem. From 2005 to 2008 we sampled bulk precipitation, throughfall, forest floor percolates and seepage (60 cm) and analyzed DOC, DON and mineral N concentrations. Average DOC fluxes in the soil were extremely high (962 and 478 kg ha year in forest floor percolates and seepage, respectively) while DON fluxes were similar to other (sub) tropical ecosystems (16 and 8 kg N ha year , respectively). Total N fluxes in the soil were dominated by DON. Dissolved organic C and N concentrations in forest floor percolates were independent of the water flux. No dilution effect was visible. Instead, the pool size of potentially soluble DOC and DON was variable as indicated by different DOC and DON concentrations in forest floor percolates at similar precipitation amounts. Therefore, we hypothesized, that these pools are not likely to be depleted in the long term. The relationship between water fluxes in bulk precipitation and DOC and DON fluxes in forest floor percolates was positive (DOC r = 0.908, DON r = 0.842, respectively, Spearman rank correlation). We concluded, that precipitation is an important driver for DOC and DON losses from this subtropical montane forest and that these DOC losses play an important role in the soil cycle of this ecosystem. Moreover, we found that the linear relationship between bulk precipitation and DOC and DON fluxes in forest floor percolates of temperate ecosystems does not hold when incorporating additional data on these fluxes from (subtropical) ecosystems.
20055228|Particulate biogenic silica (BSi) carried by rivers to estuaries and marine sediments is generally assumed to be primarily composed of diatoms. Phytoliths -- biogenic opal formed in plants -- are found in some marine sediments where they are interpreted to be the result of atmospheric and river inputs. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of phytoliths to the suspended load of rivers of the Nyong basin (Cameroon). BSi (2 m to 2 mm fraction) in the soils and the rivers range respectively, from 0.9 to 3.9 wt% and from 1.3 to 4 wt%. About 90% of the BSi pool in both soils and river suspended load are composed of phytoliths. Thecamoebians and fresh water diatoms are minor components. The concentrations of BSi and the phytolith assemblages show great similarities between the waters and the soil samples. This result implies that the erosion of top soils is the major source of the suspended load, in good agreement with the transport-limited weathering regime of the study basin.
1469952|In order to evaluate soil functions of contemporary agricultural management practices, the adjustment of microbial biomass and C and N mineralisation capacities was monitored during 9 years following the implementation of conventional and reduced tillage, and mineral N and pig slurry fertilisation systems. Soil microbial biomass content and microbial activities decreased continuously from initial values. The decrease was slowed by slurry application, compared to either no or mineral N fertilisation, and both slurry and mineral N application stimulated soil microbial activities in the long-term. There were no significant differences in microbiological characteristics between conventional and reduced tillage for the 0 to 30 cm soil depth but microbial biomass and activity were highest from 0 to 15 cm depth under reduced tillage. Changes in several microbial properties became evident when analysing the whole experiment of 9 years and the soil unit is also of importance as shown by higher microbial activity level in Anthrosols in comparison to Luvisols.
1468521|Nitrogen inputs, fluxes, internal generation and consumption, and outputs were monitored in a subalpine spruce-fir forest at approximately 1000-m elevation on Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks of New York, USA. Nitrogen in precipitation, cloudwater and dry deposition was collected on an event basis and quantified as an input. Throughfall, stemflow, litterfall and soil water were measured to determine fluxes within the forest. Nitrogen mineralization in the forest floor was estimated to determine internal sources of available N. Lower mineral horizon soil water was used to estimate output from the ecosystem. Vegetation and soil N pools were determined. During four years of continuous monitoring, an average of 16 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> was delivered to the forest canopy as precipitation, cloudwater and dry deposition from the atmosphere. Approximately 30% of the input was retained by the canopy. Canopy retention is likely the result of both foliar uptake and immobilization by bark, foliage and microorganisms. Approximately 40 kg of N was made available within the forest floor from mineralization of organic matter. Virtually all the available ammonium (mineralized plus input from throughfall) is utilized in the forest floor, either by microorganisms or through uptake by vegetation. The most abundant N component of soil water solutions leaving the system was nitrate. Net ecosystem fluxes indicate accumulation of both ammonium and nitrate. There is a small net loss of organic N from the ecosystem. Some nitrate leaves the bottom of the B horizon throughout the year. Comparisons with other temperate coniferous sites and examination of the ecosystem N mass balance indicate that N use efficiency is less at our site, which suggests that the site is not severely limited by N.
40343641|Recent research has dramatically advanced our understanding of soil organic matter chemistry and the role of N in some organic matter transformations, but the effects of N deposition on soil C dynamics remain difficult to anticipate. We examined soil organic matter chemistry and enzyme kinetics in three size fractions (> 250 m, 63-250 m, and < 63 m) following 6 years of simulated atmospheric N deposition in two ecosystems with contrasting litter biochemistry (sugar maple, Acer saccharum  basswood, Tilia americana and black oak, Quercus velutina  white oak, Q. alba). Ambient and simulated (80-kg NO-N ha year ) atmospheric N deposition were studied in three replicate stands in each ecosystem. We found striking, ecosystem-specific effects of N deposition on soil organic matter chemistry using pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. First, furfural, the dominant pyrolysis product of polysaccharides, was significantly decreased by simulated N deposition in the sugar maple-basswood ecosystem (15.9 vs. 5.0%) but was increased by N deposition in the black oak-white oak ecosystem (8.8 vs. 24.0%). Second, simulated atmospheric N deposition increased the ratio of total lignin derivatives to total polysaccharides in the > 250 m fraction of the sugar maple-basswood ecosystem from 0.9 to 3.3 but there were no changes in other size classes or in the black oak-white oak ecosystem. Third, simulated  deposition increased the ratio of lignin derivatives to N-bearing compounds in the 63-250 and > 250 m fractions in both ecosystems but not in the < 63 m fraction. Relationships between enzyme kinetics and organic matter chemistry were strongest in the particulate fractions (> 63 m) where there were multiple correlations between oxidative enzyme activities and concentrations of lignin derivatives and between glycanolytic enzyme activities and concentrations of carbohydrates. Within silt-clay fractions (< 63 ), these enzyme-substrate correlations were attenuated by interactions with particle surfaces. Our results demonstrate that variation in enzyme activity resulting from atmospheric N deposition is directly linked to changes in soil organic matter chemistry, particularly those that occur within coarse soil size fractions.
1468884|Nitrous oxide fluxes and soil nitrogen transformations were measured in experimentally-treated high elevation Douglas-fir forests in northwestern New Mexico, USA. On an annual basis, forests that were fertilized with 200 kg N/ha emitted an average of 0.66 kg/ha of N<sub>2</sub>O-N, with highest fluxes occurring in July and August when soils were both warm and wet. Control, irrigated, and woodchip treated plots were not different from each other, and annual average fluxes ranged from 0.03 to 0.23 kg/ha. Annual net nitrogen mineralization and nitrate production were estimated in soil and forest floor using in situ incubations; fertilized soil mineralized 277 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in contrast to 18 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in control plots. Relative recovery of <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>-N applied to soil in laboratory incubations was principally in the form of NO<sup>3</sup>-N in the fertilized soils, while recovery was mostly in microbial biomass-N in the other treatments. Fertilization apparently added nitrogen that exceeded the heterotrophic microbial demand, resulting in higher rates of nitrate production and higher nitrous oxide fluxes. Despite the elevated nitrous oxide emission resulting from fertilization, we estimate that global inputs of nitrogen into forests are not currently contributing significantly to the increasing concentrations of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere.
24715097|Peatland headwater streams are consistently supersaturated with respect to gaseous C and are known to degas CO and CH directly to the atmosphere. Using a combination of injection of a purposeful gas tracer (propane) and a soluble tracer (NaC1) we carried out 49 measurements of the gas transfer coefficient on 12 representative stream reaches to quantify the gas transfer rates of CO and CH in headwater (1st3rd order) streams draining six UK peatlands. These were compared to measured stream reach physical variables, such as discharge and water travel time. Whilst we found that evasion rates were highly variable in space and time, ${\mathrm{K}}_{{\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}}$ (gas transfer coefficient of CO) was positively related to discharge. Individual study sites showed a high degree of variability in gas transfer rates; at all 49 sites median/mean values for ${\mathrm{K}}_{{\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}}$ were 0.087/0.157 and ${\mathrm{K}}_{{\mathrm{C}\mathrm{H}}_{4}}$ 0.092/0.176 min. Median/mean instantaneous CO and CH evasion rates were 133/367 and 0.22/1.45 g C m s, respectively. Methane evasion rates were therefore more than two orders of magnitude lower than CO, with CH invasion (rather than evasion) measured on 37 % of occasions. Our gas flux measurements from peatland headwater streams are higher than values previously used to estimate landscape scale fluxes and emphasise the importance of the evasion flux term in the overall carbon balance.
40800616|Three different approaches were used to calculate heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh) and soil carbon dynamics in an old-growth deciduous forest in central Germany. A root and mycorrhiza exclosure experiment in the field separated auto-and heterotrophic soil respiration. It was compared to modeled heterotrophic respiration resulting from two different approaches: a modular component model of soil respiration calculated autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration with litter, climate and canopy photosynthesis as input variables. It was calibrated by independent soil respiration measurements in the field. A second model was calibrated by incubation of soil samples from different soil layers in the laboratory. In this case, the annual sum of Rh was calculated by an empirical model including response curves to temperature and a soil moisture. The three approaches showed good accordance during spring and summer and when the annual sums of Rh calculated by the two models were compared. Average Rh for the years 2002-2006 were 436 g C m year (field model) and 417 g C m year (lab-model), respectively. Differences between the approaches revealed specific limitations of each method. The average carbon balance of the Hainich forest soil was estimated to be between 1 and 35 g C m year depending on the model used and the averaging period. A comparison with nighttime data from eddy covariance (EC) showed that EC data were lower than modelled soil respiration in many situations. We conclude that better filter methods for EC nighttime data have to be developed.
41490473|Silicon transport and incorporation into plant tissue is important to both plant physiological function and to the influence plants have on ecosystem silica cycling. However, the mechanisms controlling this transport have only begun to be explored. In this study, we used secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) to image concentrations of Si in root and shoot tissues of annual blue grass (Poa annua L.) and orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) with the goal of identifying control points in the plant silica uptake pathway. In addition, we used SIMS to describe the distributions of germanium (Ge); the element used to trace Si in biogeochemical studies. Within root tissue, Si and Ge were localized in the suberized thickwalled region of endodermal cells, i.e. the proximal side of endodermal cells which is in close association to the casparian strip. In leaves, Si was present in the cell walls, but Ge was barely detectable. The selective localization of Si and Ge in the proximal side of endodermal cell walls of roots suggests transport control is exerted upon Si and Ge by the plant. The absence of Si in most root cell walls and its presence in the cell walls of leaves (in areas outside of the transpiration terminus) suggests modifications in the chemical form of Si to a form that favors Si complexation in the cell walls of leaf tissue. The low abundance of Ge in leaf tissue is consistent with previous studies that suggest preferential transport of Si relative to Ge.
41410600|There are 10,091 km of peatlands in Estonia and human activities may have changed the role of northern peatlands from global sinks to global sources of carbon. The aim of this work was to explain the changes in organic carbon exports from eleven Estonian rivers in the period 1992-2007 in terms of land use change, climate change quantified by trends in stream-water discharge and hydrological droughts and reductions in atmospheric sulfate quantified by change in water chemistry. Direct TOC (total organic carbon) measurements had been initiated in 1998. We used CODKMnO (permanganate oxygen consumed) as its surrogate for the whole time span (Spearman's determination coefficient in six small northern Estonian rivers 0.95 >  > 0.72; p < 0.01). The Mann-Kendall test revealed significant trends in the TOC proxy in five small rivers in northern Estonia (M-K stat > 2.35; p < 0.05). The trends in the eleven investigated streams correlated closely with the increased 28 ratios of drought days (Spearman's  = 0.68; p < 0.01). The correlations with land use compositions, decreases in water discharges and $SO_4^{2 - }$ concentrations were insignificant (p > 0.05). We conclude that the main factor in the increase of organic carbon export is the deepening of droughts driven by climate change, magnified by man-made drainage.
1469954|We studied five eutrophic (high phosphorus) and six mesotrophic/oligotrophic (low phosphorus) lakes in Maine, USA, all of which are dimictic and develop anoxic hypolimnia during stratification. The lakes were sampled during the stratified period from May to September 1999. Late summer hypolimnetic total phosphorus (P) concentrations in the high-P lakes ranged from 185 to 460 ppb; epilimnetic total P increased up to 30 ppb from the spring to the fall overturn. During the same period, the low-P lakes had hypolimnetic total P concentrations in the range of 6-19 ppb. Individual high-P lakes demonstrated strong temporal correlations between aqueous hypolimnetic dissolved Fe and total P concentrations (R<sup>2</sup> 0.88) with an average molar Fe:P ratio of 11.9 4.2. For the combined data, the high-P lakes exhibited strong correlation between hypolimnetic Fe and P concentrations (R<sup>2</sup>=0.82). The low-P lakes, however, did not show a good correlation between the hypolimnetic Fe and P concentrations. Among the low-P lakes two lakes had hypolimnetic Fe fluxes comparable to the Fe fluxes of the high-P lakes. These two lakes had considerably higher hypolimnetic Fe:P ratios than all other lakes studied here. There were no significant differences in surface sediment Fe(III) or P fractions that correlated with the differences in the relationship between aqueous concentrations of Fe and P in these two outlier low-P lakes. A model for the generation of hypolimnetic acid neutralization capacity (ANC) was developed based on microbially-catalyzed reduction of Fe(III) hydroxide, Mn(IV) oxide and sulfate. Reduction of Fe(III) hydroxide was the most important contributor to the increase in the hypolimnetic ANC in all high-P and the two outlier lakes. Assuming that all hypolimnetic P was due to the reduction of Fe(III) hydroxide by bacteria and sulfide, average summer hypolimnetic P flux for each lake was predicted using the sediment reducible Fe(III):P ratio. The observed and predicted average P fluxes in the high-P lakes corresponded reasonably, suggesting that in these lakes internal P release is closely related to the reduction of Fe(III) hydroxide. Other release or sequestration mechanisms may operate for the release and availability of P in the low-P lakes.
23359741|Production and accumulation of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a major greenhouse gas, in shallow groundwater might contribute to indirect N 2 O emissions to the atmosphere (e.g., when groundwater flows into a stream or a river). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has attributed an emission factor (EF 5g ) for N 2 O, associated with nitrate leaching in groundwater and drainage ditches0.0025 (corresponding to 0.25% of N leached which is emitted as N 2 O)although this is the subject of considerable uncertainty. We investigated and quantified the transport and fate of nitrate (NO 3 - ) and dissolved nitrous oxide from crop fields to groundwater and surface water over a 2-year period (monitoring from April 2008 to April 2010) in a transect from a plateau to the river with three piezometers. In groundwater, nitrate concentrations ranged from 1.0 to 22.7 mg NO 3 - N l -1 (from 2.8 to 37.5 mg NO 3 - N l -1 in the river) and dissolved N 2 O from 0.2 to 101.0 g N 2 ON l -1 (and from 0.2 to 2.9 g N 2 ON l -1 in the river). From these measurements, we estimated an emission factor of EF 5g = 0.0026 (similar to the value currently used by the IPCC) and an annual indirect N 2 O flux from groundwater of 0.035 kg N 2 ON ha -1 year -1 , i.e., 1.8% of the previously measured direct N 2 O flux from agricultural soils.
1469367|The chemical composition during baseflow was used to elucidate the fundamental processes controlling longitudinal and seasonal patterns of stream acidity in Yellow Creek, a chronically acidic headwater (pH range 3.7-4.2) on the Appalachian Plateau in northeastern West Virginia. Sulfate concentrations controlled the variability of stream acidity within the Yellow Creek catchment. Decreases in stream free H<sup>+</sup> acidity with decreasing elevation likely resulted from SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> retention in riparian wetland areas as well as spatial variation in dominant tree species. Seasonal variations in free H<sup>+</sup> and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al<sup>n+</sup>) concentrations appeared related to seasonal fluctuations in baseflow discharge which was controlled by vegetative activity. Baseflow stream discharge, as well as H<sup>+</sup> and Al<sup>n+</sup> acidity, gradually declined during the growing season (June through October), likely reflecting microbial SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction in saturated anaerobic environments within riparian wetlands. A marked pulse of stream H<sup>+</sup>, Al<sup>n+</sup>, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> coincided with an abrupt increase in baseflow discharge resulting from the cessation of transpiration after leaf-fall in November. This seasonal pattern suggests that autumn may be a critical period for eastern brook trout in streams draining wetlands on the Appalachian Plateau.
20456574|The watershed of the Altamaha River, Georgia, is one of the largest in the southeastern U.S., draining 36,718 km (including parts of metro Atlanta). We calculated both nitrogen (fertilizer, net food and feed import, atmospheric deposition, and biological N fixation in agricultural and forest lands) and phosphorus (fertilizer and net food and feed import) inputs to the watershed for 6 time points between 1954 and 2002. Total nitrogen inputs rose from 1,952 kg N km yr in 1954 to a peak of 3,593 kg N km yr in 1982 and then declined to 2,582 kg N km yr by 2002. Phosphorus inputs rose from 409 kg P km yr in 1954 to 532 kg P km yr in 1974 before declining to 412 kg P km yr in 2002. Fertilizer tended to be the most important input of both N and P to the watershed, although net food and feed import increased in importance over time and was the dominant source of N input by 2002. When considered on an individual basis, fertilizer input tended to be highest in the middle portions of the watershed (Little and Lower Ocmulgee and Lower Oconee sub-watersheds) whereas net food and feed imports were highest in the upper reaches (Upper Oconee and Upper Ocmulgee sub-watersheds). Although the overall trend in recent years has been towards decreases in both N and P inputs, these trends may be offset due to continuing increases in animal and human populations.
41490533|Experimental and theoretical work emphasize the role of plant nutrient uptake in regulating ecosystem nutrient losses and predict that forest succession, ecosystem disturbance, and continued inputs of atmospheric nitrogen (N) will increase watershed N export. In ecosystems where snowpack insulates soils, soil-frost disturbances resulting from low or absent snowpack are thought to increase watershed  export and may become more common under climate-change scenarios. This study monitored watershed N export from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in response to a widespread, severe soil-frost event in the winter of 2006. We predicted that nitrate (NO) export following the disturbance would be high compared to low background streamwater NO export in recent years. However, post-disturbance annual NO 3 ~ export was the lowest on record from both reference (undisturbed) and treated experimental harvest or CaSiO 3 addition watersheds. These results are consistent with other studies finding greater than expected forest NO retention throughout the northeastern US and suggest that changes over the last five decades have reduced impacts of frost events on watershed NO export. While it is difficult to parse out causes from a complicated array of potential factors, based on longterm records and watershed-scale experiments conducted at the HBEF, we propose that reduced N losses in response to frost are due to a combination of factors including the long-term legacies of land use, processlevel alterations in N pathways, climate-driven hydrologic changes, and depletion of base cations and/or reduced soil pH due to cumulative effects of acid deposition.
1469279|Although nitrogen is considered to be the nutrient that most commonly limits production of natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems, I propose that phosphorus may regulate productivity in many continuously cultivated agroecosystems that do not receive applications of synthetic fertilizers. One way P may limit agroecosystem productivity is by controlling nitrogen fixation of legume crops, thus affecting nitrogen availability in the overall agroecosystem. I tested this hypothesis in two studies by examining the effect of phosphorus nutrition on nitrogen fixation of alfalfa in traditional Mexican agroecosystems. All farms used in the research relied on alfalfa as the primary nitrogen source for maize cultivation and other crops, and had minimal or no reliance on synthetic fertilizers. In one study, I used the natural abundance of <sup>15</sup>N to estimate nitrogen fixation in five alfalfa plots with soils representing a wide range of P fertility. I found a correlation of r = 0.85 between foliage P concentrations and nitrogen fixation in the alfalfa plots. Mean nitrogen fixation in alfalfa plots ranged between 232-555 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> as estimated by the <sup>15</sup>N-natural abundance method. In a second study, I sampled soils from alfalfa plots on traditional farms located in 5 different physiographic regions of Mexico. Half of each soil sample was augmented with phosphorus in a greenhouse experiment. I grew alfalfa on the fertilized and unfertilized soils from each site and then determined nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction) of the Rhizobium on the plant roots. Nitrogenase activity increased in the alfalfa grown on all soils with added phosphorus, with two of the five differences being statistically significant at P < 0.01, and one at P < 0.05. Foliage P concentrations and nitrogenase activity were positively correlated (r = 0.81, P < 0.01).
1468747|Annual and seasonal rates of net nitrogen mineralization were determined for 19 sites in the spruce-fir forests of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. These sites included high and low elevation stands of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and Fraser fir (Abies fraseri (Pursh.) Poir.) on east and west exposures on Whitetop Mountain, Virginia; Mt. Mitchell, North Carolina; and Clingman's Dome in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Mineralization rates were determined using in situ soil incubations in PVC tubes with ion exchange resin bags placed in the bottom of the tubes to collect leachate. Throughfall was collected in resin bags placed in the top of the tubes. Average initial NH<sub>4</sub>-N+NO<sub>3</sub>-N ranged from 0.6 to 4.8 kg N/ha across all plots, and average mineralization rates ranged from 26 to 180 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Throughfall ranged from 18 to 32 kg-N ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> with NH<sub>4</sub>-N accounting for about two-thirds of the throughfall N across all sites. Throughfall and mineralization rates were not related to elevation or exposure. The high rates of N mineralization and relatively high nitrate concentrations indicate that leaching losses of nitrogen and associated cations could be substantial.

1469228|The North Atlantic Ocean receives the largest allochthonous supplies of nitrogen of any ocean basin because of the close proximity of industrialized nations. In this paper, we describe the major standing stocks, fluxes and transformations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the pelagic regions of the North Atlantic, as one part of a larger effort to understand the entire N and P budgets in the North Atlantic Ocean, its watersheds and overlying atmosphere. The primary focus is on nitrogen, however, we consider both nitrogen and phosphorus because of the close inter-relationship between the N and P cycles in the ocean. The oceanic standing stocks of N and P are orders of magnitude larger than the annual amount transported off continents or deposited from the atmosphere. Atmospheric deposition can have an impact on oceanic nitrogen cycling at locations near the coasts where atmospheric sources are large, or in the centers of the highly stratified gyres where little nitrate is supplied to the surface by vertical mixing of the ocean. All of the reactive nitrogen transported to the coasts in rivers is denitrified or buried in the estuaries or on the continental shelves and an oceanic source of nitrate of 0.7-0.95 10<sup>12</sup> moles NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> is required to supply the remainder of the shelf denitrification (Nixon et al., this volume). The horizontal fluxes of nitrate caused by the ocean circulation are both large and uncertain. Even the sign of the transport across the equator is uncertain and this precludes a conclusion on whether the North Atlantic Ocean as a whole is a net source or sink of nitrate. We identify a source of nitrate of 3.7-6.4 10<sup>12</sup> moles NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> within the main thermocline of the Sargasso Sea that we infer is caused by nitrogen fixation. This nitrate source may explain the nitrate divergence observed by Rintoul & Wunsch (1991) in the mid-latitude gyre. The magnitude of nitrogen fixation inferred from this nitrate source would exceed previous estimates of global nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation requires substantial quantities of iron as a micro-nutrient and the calculated iron requirement is comparable to the rates supplied by the deposition of iron associated with Saharan dust. Interannual variability in dust inputs is large and could cause comparable signals in the nitrogen fixation rate. The balance of the fluxes across the basin boundaries suggest that the total stocks of nitrate and phosphate in the North Atlantic may be increasing on time-scales of centuries. Some of the imbalance is related to the inferred nitrogen fixation in the gyre and the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, both of which may be influenced by human activities. However, the fluxes of dissolved organic nutrients are almost completely unknown and they have the potential to alter our perception of the overall mass balance of the North Atlantic Ocean.
41490475|In a microcosm N enrichment experiment we tested the effect of floating vegetation (Lemna sp.) and submerged vegetation (Elodea nuttallii) on denitrification rates, and compared it to systems without macrophytes. Oxygen concentration, and thus photosynthesis, plays an important role in regulating denitrification rates and therefore the experiments were performed under dark as well as under light conditions. Denitrification rates differed widely between treatments, ranging from 2.8 to 20.9 mol N m b, and were strongly affected by the type of macrophytes present. These differences may be explained by the effects of macrophytes on oxygen conditions. Highest denitrification rates were observed under a closed mat of floating macrophytes where oxygen concentrations were low. In the light, denitrification was inhibited by oxygen from photosynthesis by submerged macrophytes, and by benthic algae in the systems without macrophytes. However, in microcosms with floating vegetation there was no effect of light, as the closed mat of floating plants caused permanently dark conditions in the water column. Nitrate removal was dominated by plant uptake rather than denitrification, and did not differ between systems with submerged or floating plants.
40343623|Export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from grassland ecosystems can be an important C flux which directly affects ecosystem C balance since DOC is leached from the soil to the groundwater. DOC fluxes and their controlling factors were investigated on two grassland sites with similar climatic conditions but different soil types (Vertisol vs. Arenosol) for a 2.5-year period. Parts of both grasslands were disturbed by deep ploughing during afforestation. Contrary to what was expected, ploughing did not increase DOC export but surface soil DOC concentrations decreased by 28% (Vertisol) and 14% (Arenosol). DOC flux from the soil profile was negatively influences by the clay content of the soil with seven times larger DOC export in the clay-poor Arenosol (55 kg C ha a) than in the clay-rich Vertisol (8 kg C ha a). At the Arenosol site, highest DOC concentrations were measured in late summer, whereas in the Vertisol there was a time lag of several months between surface and subsoil DOC with highest subsoil DOC concentrations during winter season. DOC export was not correlated with soil organic carbon stocks. Large differences in C concentrations of 22-40 pMC between soil organic carbon and DOC in the subsoil indicated that both C pools are largely decoupled. We conclude that DOC export at both sites is not controlled by the vegetation but by physicochemical parameters such as the adsorption capacity of soil minerals and the water balance of the ecosystem. Only in the acidic sandy Arenosol DOC export was a significant C flux of about 8% of net ecosystem production.
1468870| Anaerobic carbon mineralization was evaluated over a 1-year period in two Sphagnum-dominated peatlands, Big Run Bog, West Virginia, and Buckle's Bog, Maryland. In the top 35 cm of peat, mean rates of methane production, anaerobic carbon dioxide production, and sulfate reduction at Big Run Bog were 63, 406 and 146 mol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and at Buckle's Bog were 18, 486 and 104 mol L<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Annual anaerobic carbon mineralization to methane and carbon dioxide at Big Run Bog and Buckle's Bog was 52.8 and 57.2 mol m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Rates of methane production were similar to rates reported for other freshwater peatlands, but methane production accounted for only 11.7 and 2.8%, respectively, of the total anaerobic carbon mineralization at these two sites. Carbon dioxide production, resulting substantially from sulfate reduction, dominated anaerobic carbon mineralization. Considerable sulfate reduction despite low instantaneous dissolved sulfate concentrations (typically <300 mol L<sup>-1</sup> of substrate) was apparently fueled by oxidation and rapid turnover of the reduced inorganic sulfur pool. The coincidence of high sulfate inputs to the Big Run Bog and Buckle's Bog watersheds through acid precipitation with the unexpected importance of sulfate reduction leads us to suggest a new hypothesis: peatlands not receiving high sulfate loading should exhibit low rates of anaerobic decomposition, and a predominance of methane production over sulfate reduction; however, if such peatlands become subjected to high rates of sulfur deposition, sulfate reduction may be enhanced as an anaerobic mineralization pathway with attendant effects on carbon balance and peat accumulation. 
1469275|The roles of plant transport and CH<sub>4</sub> production in controlling CH<sub>4</sub> flux from wet meadow tundra communities were investigated. Plant transport was the dominant pathway of CH<sub>4</sub> flux from this ecosystem. Most CH<sub>4</sub> production (measured with in situ anaerobic incubations) occurred well below the water table, and C supply (estimated by anaerobic CO<sub>2</sub> production) was the best single predictor of CH<sub>4</sub> production rates. Plant transport of CH<sub>4</sub> was controlled both by CH<sub>4</sub> supply and the plant species. Eriophorum angustifolium transported substantially more CH<sub>4</sub> than did Carex aquatilis, due to differences in size and structure of the two species. The composition of the plant community was a greater control on CH<sub>4</sub> flux from the site than either water table height (which varied only slightly) or CH<sub>4</sub> production rates, indicating the importance of species-specific plant dynamics in controlling CH<sub>4</sub> flux from arctic wetlands.
1468933| We applied fertilizers in a 2<sup>3</sup> complete factorial design to determine the effects of nutrient amendments on plant growth in Hawaiian montane forests growing on two different volcanic substrates: 'a' and phoehoe lava. Both sites were about 140 years old and their overstories were nearly monospecific stands of Metrosideros polymorpha. Fertilizer applications included N, P, a mixture of essential macro- and micronutrients excepting P and N, and all combinations thereof in each of four blocks. Additions of nutrients other than N or P had no significant effects on measured plant-growth variables. In contrast, additions of either N or P significantly increased tree height growth, diameter increments, biomass growth, and height growth of the understory fern Dicranopteris linearis in both sites. The effect of N was greater than that of P. Greatest growth rates occurred in plots receiving both N and P, and signficant N*P interactions occurred in several cases, suggesting a synergistic effect between these two elements. Plant growth on these young, poorly weathered, basaltic lavas is colimited by N and P availability. Growth in a similar-aged stand growing on a mixture of volcanic ash and cinders is N but not P limited, indicating that the texture of the parent material influences nutrient-availability patterns during early primary succession. 
1468519|Soil nitrogen transformations and nitrous oxide fluxes were measured in a range of sagebrush steppe ecosystems in south-central Wyoming. Net nitrate production, measured in laboratory incubations, was highest in the ecosystem type dominated by Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana, especially early in the growing season. Fluxes of nitrous oxide, measured in closed chambers and analyzed by gas chromatography, also tended to be higher in the same type, but only for short periods in the spring. Thereafter, all nitrous oxide fluxes were low and did not differ consistently among types. Estimated average annual fluxes for three Artemisia ecosystem types (dominated by Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana, Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis, and Artemisia nova) were 0.32, 0.23 and 0.13 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup>y<sup>-1</sup> repsectively. Average annual flux, weighted by the areal extent of these and other vegetation types in the region, was approximately 0.21 kg N<sub>2</sub>O-N ha<sup>-1</sup>y<sup>-1</sup>. Assuming this landscape is representative of sagebrush steppe, we calculate a flux of 9.5 10<sup>9</sup> g y<sup>-1</sup> of N<sub>2</sub>O-N from U.S. sagebrush steppe, and a flux of 1.1 10<sup>11</sup> g y<sup>-1</sup> of N<sub>2</sub>O-N from analogous desert and semi-desert shrublands of the world.
41410585|Dissolved organic matter (DOM) influences inland water ecosystems through its light absorbing qualities. We investigated how pH affects light absorption by DOM with pH manipulation experiments and with data from two lake surveys. We hypothesized that: (1) light absorption and photobleaching of DOM would increase with increasing pH, and (2) as a result of photobleaching, molar absorption (i.e. light absorbance at 440 nm/dissolved organic carbon concentration) would decrease among lakes with increasing pH. In experiments with filtered lake water both initial light absorption and photobleaching rates increased at higher (i.e. more basic) pH along with a concomitant shift in the size of DOM toward larger colloidal materials measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM) revealed large colloidal to particulate-sized organic matter in alkaline relative to acidic treatments. In the lake surveys, molar absorption coefficients were negatively related to pH across gradients similar to the experiments. Our results are consistent with a conceptual model in which at low pH DOM polymers and colloids are condensed limiting exposure of chromophores to light; at higher pH, polymers and colloids are expanded exposing chromophores to light resulting in greater initial light absorption and faster photobleaching. Hence, water transparency, which is significantly controlled by DOM, is sensitive to environmental changes that influence the pH and chemical composition of inland waters.
41490413|The flow of carbon and nutrients from plant production into detrital food webs is mediated by microbial enzymes released into the environment (ecoenzymes). Ecoenzymatic activities are linked to both microbial metabolism and environmental resource availability. In this paper, we extend the theoretical and empirical framework for ecoenzymatic stoichiometry from nutrient availability to carbon composition by relating ratios of -1,4-glucosidase (BG), acid (alkaline) phosphatase (AP), -N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and phenol oxidase (POX) activities in soils to measures of organic matter recalcitrance, using data from 28 ecosystems. BG and POX activities are uncorrelated even though both are required for lignocellulose degradation. However, the ratio of BG: POX activity is negatively correlated with the relative abundance of recalcitrant carbon. Unlike BG, POX activity is positively correlated with (NAG + LAP) and AP activities. We propose that the effect of organic matter recalcitrance on microbial C:N and C:P threshold element ratios (TER) can be represented by normalizing BG, AP and (NAG + LAP) activities to POX activity. The scaling relationships among these ratios indicate that the increasing recalcitrance of decomposing organic matter effectively reverses the growth rate hypothesis of stoichiometric theory by decreasing carbon and nutrient availability and slowing growth, which increases TER N:P . This effect is consistent with the narrow difference between the mean elemental C:N ratios of soil organic matter and microbial biomass and with the inhibitory effect of N enrichment on rates of decomposition and microbial metabolism for recalcitrant organic matter. From these findings, we propose a conceptual framework for bottom-up decomposition models that integrate the stoichiometry of ecoenzymatic activities into general theories of ecology.
40343591|Forests soils should be neither sinks nor sources of carbon in a long-term perspective. From a Swedish perspective the time since the last glaciation has probably not been long enough to reach a steady state, although changes are currently very slow. In a shorter perspective, climatic and management changes over the past 100 years have probably created imbalances between litter input to soils and organic carbon mineralisation. Using extant data on forest inventories, we applied models to analyse possible changes in the carbon stocks of Swedish forest soils. The models use tree stocks to provide estimates of tree litter production, which are fed to models of litter decomposition and from which carbon stocks are calculated. National soil carbon stocks were estimated to have increased by 3 Tg yr or 12-13 g m yr in the period 1926-2000 and this increase will continue because soil stocks are far from equilibrium with current litter inputs. The figure obtained is likely to be an underestimation because wet sites store more carbon than predicted here and the inhibitory effect of nitrogen deposition on soil carbon mineralisation was neglected. Knowledge about site history prior to the calculation period determines the accuracy of current soil carbon stocks estimates, although changes can be more accurately estimated.
20055225|Most modelling studies of soil and surface water recovery from acidification assume a constant influence of climate over the simulation period. Given the likelihood of future climate change, and recent identification of links between climatic fluctuations and surface water trends on decadal time scales, an attempt is made to simulate a number of climate-related effects on the recovery of an acidified stream in mid-Wales. Empirical relationships were derived to model past and future variations in (i) runoff, as a function of rainfall and temperature: (ii) stream chloride concentration and sea-salt deposition, as a function of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI); and (iii) stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, as a function of summer temperatures and sulphur deposition. incorporation these relationships in the MAGIC dynamic model reproduced a significant part of the observed variation in streamwater chemistry. Current scenarios of rising UK temperature and NAOI, and falling rainfall and acid deposition, were used to forecast effects of climate change on soil and water recovery from acidification. Results suggest that increasing DOC would have a significant negative impact on soil recovery, with elevated organic acidity lowering soil water pH and severely depleting soil base saturation. The resulting increase in soil base cation export would, however, have a positive impact on streamwater recovery. For increased sea-salt deposition, effects are essentially the opposite; increased base cation inputs enhance the recovery of soil base saturation, but displace acidity to the stream. However, simulated effects of raising DOC considerably outweighed those of increased sea-salt deposition. It is argued that greater consideration of these, and other, climatic effects on biogeochemical cycles needs to be taken when predicting the recovery of soils and surface waters from acidification.
1468770|A conceptual diagram of the S cycle in grassland soils is presented as a framework for discussing S cycling process studies. Changes in the mineralization of S and in the redistribution of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled sulfate among soil organic matter fractions were investigated during incubation of cropped and uncropped soils. Little mineralization or net immobilization of sulfur occurred in closed system incubations where the soils were left undisturbed throughout the incubations. Significantly more S was mineralized in open system incubations where the soils were leached periodically. Net mineralization was significantly greater in cropped soils compared with uncropped soils. The distribution of <sup>35</sup>S was significantly affected by the addition of various substrates (sulfate, cellulose or a combination of both) and by the presence of plants. Under conditions of high solution sulfate, the majority of <sup>35</sup>S incorporated was observed in the HI-reducible S fraction. When the solution sulfate concentrations were lower, there was a reduction in the proportion of <sup>35</sup>S incorporated into the HI-reducible S fraction. The results of these experiment will be discussed in relation to the hypotheses presented by McGill and Cole (1981) and the conceptual diagram of the S cycle in grassland soils.
1469697|Regional to global scale modelling of N flux from land to ocean has progressed to date through the development of simple empirical models representing bulk N flux rates from large watersheds, regions, or continents on the basis of a limited selection of model parameters. Watershed scale N flux modelling has developed a range of physically-based approaches ranging from models where N flux rates are predicted through a physical representation of the processes involved, through to catchment scale models which provide a simplified representation of true systems behaviour. Generally, these watershed scale models describe within their structure the dominant process controls on N flux at the catchment or watershed scale, and take into account variations in the extent to which these processes control N flux rates as a function of landscape sensitivity to N cycling and export. This paper addresses the nature of the errors and uncertainties inherent in existing regional to global scale models, and the nature of error propagation associated with upscaling from small catchment to regional scale through a suite of spatial aggregation and conceptual lumping experiments conducted on a validated watershed scale model, the export coefficient model. Results from the analysis support the findings of other researchers developing macroscale models in allied research fields. Conclusions from the study confirm that reliable and accurate regional scale N flux modelling needs to take account of the heterogeneity of landscapes and the impact that this has on N cycling processes within homogenous landscape units.
1468949| Atmospheric inputs and stream water outputs of P, K, Ca and Mg were estimated for an undisturbed forested watershed and the forest ecosystem within it in Ta National Park, Cte d'Ivoire in 1990/91. The study included measurements of wet and dry deposition, and suspended sediments, organic debris and solutes in the water flows. Base flow as well as quick flow were sampled. The nutrient budgets of the entire watershed and the forest ecosystem (comprising vegetation and rooted soil layers) were distinguished on the basis of two assumptions (i) solutes in the base flow are derived from the soil layers below the rooted zone only, and hence not from the forest ecosystem; (ii) the total soil mass in the rooted zone remains constant, i.e. the export of topsoil material by erosion is compensated for by deepening the root zone. The first assumption was supported by the resemblance of the molar ratios of solutes in the base flow and those calculated for the weathering of the migmatite found in the soil layers below the rooted zone. It is concluded that the stocks of P, K, Ca and Mg in the watershed are decreasing with 1.4, 12.7, 15.3, and 8.1 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> respectively. Losses are mainly a result of nutrient exports by erosion and solutes in the base flow. Nutrient stocks for the forest ecosystem are also apparently decreasing, but to a much lesser extent, indicating the importance of distinguishing between the watershed and the forest ecosystem within. 
4151459|Nitrogen (N) enrichment of tropical ecosystems is likely to increase with rapid industrial and agricultural development, but the ecological consequences of N additions in these systems are not well understood. We measured soil N- oxide emissions and N transformations in primary rain forest ecosystems at four elevations and across two substrate types on Mt.

We also measured N pools and fluxes across a land use gradient of primary forest, burned secondary forest, and fertilized agriculture. Background soil N
1468948| During December and January, dry northeasterly surface winds (the Harmattan) distribute dust over West Africa. Rate of deposition and some chemical and physical characteristics of Harmattan dust were measured in Ta National Park in the southwest corner of Cte d'Ivoire during the 1990-1991 dry season. The dust deposition was estimated by the classical water-filled basin method and by using canopy drip to account for deposition on tree canopies. Contamination by local biotic debris in both, water-filled basin and canopy drip collectors, was corrected for by using Ti (which appears to be wholly of atmospheric origin) as a reference element. Harmattan dust in Ta consisted mainly of kaolinitic silt finer than that collected in North Nigeria, closer to the source area in the Chad basin. The estimates of seasonal deposition rates were 33 to 47 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for the water-filled basin method and around 80 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for the canopy drip method. The higher value in canopy drip was in agreement with expected higher deposition of fine dust on the canopies than on a water surface, and was therefore considered more reliable to estimate nutrient inputs by Harmattan dust deposition. The seasonal nutrient input by dust was thus estimated to be 0.11 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for P, 2.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for K, 3.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for Ca and 0.4 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for Mg. 
1468734|Molybdenum is required for both dinitrogen fixation and nitrate assimilation. In oxic waters the primary form of molybdenum is the molybdate anion. Using radioactive [<sup>99</sup>Mo] Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub> we have shown that the transport of molybdate by a natural assemblage of freshwater phytoplankton is light-dependent and follows typical saturation kinetics. The molybdate anion is strikingly similar to sulfate and we present data to show that sulfate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdate assimilation by planktonic algae and bacteria. The ability of freshwater phytoplankton to transport molybdate is inhibited at sulfate concentrations as low as 5% of those in seawater and at sulfate: molybdate ratios as low as 50 to 100 times lower than those found in seawater. Similarly, the growth of both a freshwater bacterium and a saltwater diatom was inhibited at sulfate: molybdate ratios lower than those in seawater. The ratio of sulfate to molybdate is 10 to 100 times greater in seawater than in fresh water. This unfavorable sulfate: molybdate ratio may make molybdate less biologically available in the sea. The sulfate: molybdate ratio may explain, in part, the low rates of nitrogen fixation in N-limited salt waters.
40647951|This paper presents an uncomplicated approach to improve estimates of groundwater nutrient load to a marine embayment. A two-dimensional chemical profile of shallow groundwater was analysed in a sandy beach in three seasons (early summer, late summer and mid winter) and an adjusted estimate of groundwater nutrient discharge was derived that accounts for a complex biogeochemical environment and non-conservative behaviour of nutrients in the pre-discharge beach groundwater. The study was conducted at Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, where there has been significant groundwater contamination and associated marine ecological degradation. Losses in nitrogen and increases in phosphorus were observed along the discharge pathway beyond that expected from mixing with marine water, and the changes were attributed to chemically and biologically mediated reactions. A slow groundwater velocity (0.14-0.18 m day), high organic carbon (TOC = 0.35-4.9 mmol l, DOC = 0.28-4.6 mmol l) and low to sub-oxic conditions (DO = 0.4-24% saturation) were deemed suitable for chemically and biologically mediated reactions to occur and subsequently alter regional estimates of groundwater nutrient concentration. Accounting for this environment, groundwater loads were calculated that were 1-2 orders of magnitude less than previous regional-based estimates: 0.4-13 kg $NO_x^ - $ day ,0.2-24 kg NH day and 0.004-0.8 kg FRP day. This paper applies knowledge of recent research and presents scope to marine managers or modellers to account for groundwater inputs to the marine environment.
1469962|Residual P from historical farm practices has been linked to elevated soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transport in runoff from a field study site in the Catskills Mountains, New York, U.S.A., with a P source assay indicating that successional forest floor biomass was the major contributor to runoff SRP. In this paper, we assemble hydrological and SRP budgets that indicate net SRP loss of 0.123 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> occurs from the site (composed of 0.044 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> precipitation input, with 0.143 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and 0.024 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> losses in runoff and groundwater, respectively). These findings contrast with conservative P cycling reported for undisturbed forests. Coupled hydrological and SRP data are analyzed suggesting that catchment ambient and equilibrium SRP concentrations corresponding to groundwater and long-term average runoff concentrations are in the range capable of contributing to eutrophication of receiving waters. A physically based variable source area hydrological model is tested to simulate SRP export using deterministic concentrations. The three-layer model (surface runoff, shallow lateral flow, and groundwater) is parameterized using spatially distributed data from additional P source assays and field hydrological monitoring for the site. Differences in simulated and observed outflow and SRP export are partially explained by forest evapotranspiration and frozen soil processes. The field data, SRP budgets and simulations show that sufficient residual P pools exist to prolong net SRP loss rates until ecosystem processes re-establish more conservative P cycling.
1469960|In this study, we use a repeated-measures analysis to test the hypothesis that soil fertility under potassium-limited red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) stands at the Charles Lathrop Pack Demonstration Forest in Warrensburg, New York is increasing toward a steady state that was artificially induced in fertilized stands by K-fertilization over 50 years ago. We measured soil K by horizon and added new data to a 53-year database. We examine one mechanism that explains the higher rate of K accumulation in unfertilized stands compared with fertilized -- lateral movement of fertilizer K from treated plots to untreated -- using the rubidium/potassium reverse tracer method. Over the past five decades, soil K concentrations under both fertilized and unfertilized red pine have increased significantly. The trends under fertilized and unfertilized plots demonstrate the gradual convergence of soil K under unfertilized plots toward concentrations in fertilized plots. Five decades after fertilization, treated soils still contain greater concentrations of exchangeable K and lower bulk densities than unfertilized plots. Analysis of Rb/K ratios in the forest floor of fertilized and unfertilized plots confirms the hypothesis that lateral transport of surface broadcast fertilizer, applied over 50 years ago, extends approximately 11-16 m from the edges of fertilized plots. The four unfertilized plots closest to fertilized plots have been significantly affected by inputs of fertilizer K, while the remaining five plots are relatively unimpacted. Approximately 36% of the K in fertilized plots, and 23% of the K in unfertilized plots affected by fertilizer migration were derived directly from the fertilizer applied 5 decades ago, demonstrating the highly conservative nature of mineral nutrient cycling in aggrading forests.
41410574|Phosphorus (P) availability in estuaries may increase with increasing salinity because sulfate from sea salt supports production of sulfide in sediments, which combines with iron (Fe) making it less available to sequester P. Increased P availability with increased salinity may promote the generally observed switch from P limitation of primary production in freshwater ecosystems to nitrogen (N) limitation in coastal marine waters. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed pore water from sediment cores collected along the salinity gradients of four Chesapeake Bay estuaries (the Patuxent, Potomac, Choptank, and Bush Rivers) with watersheds differing in land cover and physiography. At salinities of 1-4 in each estuary, abrupt decreases in pore water Fe ncentrations coincided with increases in sulfate depletion and PO concetrations. Peaks in water column PO concentrations also occur at about the same position along the salinity gradient of each estuary. Increases in pore water PO concentration with increasing salinity led to distinct shifts in molar NH: PO ratios from > 16 (the Redfield ratio characteristic of phytoplankton N:P) in the freshwater cores to < 16 in the cores with salinities > 1 to 4, suggesting that release of PO from Fe where sediments are first deposited in sulfate-rich waters could promote the commonly observed switch from P limitation in freshwater to N limitation in mesohaline waters. Finding this pattern at similar salinities in four estuaries with such different watersheds suggests that it may be a fundamental characteristic of estuaries generally.
1469845|Large-scale outbreaks of defoliating insects are common in temperate forests. These outbreaks are thought to be responsible for substantial cycling of nitrogen (N), and its loss from the system. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations within poplar plots were manipulated over 2 years so that the ecosystem-wide consequences of catastrophic defoliation on N cycling could be examined. The quantities of N in leaf litter-fall, ammonia volatilization and soil N pools were estimated across the two seasons. Defoliated leaf biomass was estimated from experimentally derived approximate digestibility factors and added to the mass of senesced leaf to determine total annual leaf production. Throughout the growing season the defoliation treatment peaked at about 40% in year 1 and 100% in year 2. Rapid regrowth after defoliation meant that only 45% of the annual leaf biomass was consumed in the defoliation treatment in year 2, while control plots suffered about 20% consumption each year. In each year, defoliated plots produced 20% more leaf biomass and N than the controls, a phenomenon attributed to compensatory photosynthesis. No substantial losses of N via ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission or nitrate leaching were observed. Neither was there any sustained or substantial gain in the soils microbial biomass or inorganic N pools. These observations suggest that the defoliated poplars were able to compete with soil microbes and N loss mechanisms for soil N as it became available, thereby ameliorating the effects of defoliation on soil nitrogen cycling. We conclude from this study that the N mineralized from defoliation residues was conserved in this plantation ecosystem.
1469306|In mature Phragmites australis and Scirpus lacustris vegetated sediment methane was emitted almost exclusively by plant-mediated transport, whereas in unvegetated, but otherwise identical sediment, methane was emitted almost exclusively by ebullition. Diel variations in methane emission, with highest emission rates at daytime and emission peaks following sunrise, were demonstrated for Phragmites and Scirpus. The diel difference and magnitude of the emission peaks were much smaller for Scirpus than for Phragmites. In contrast to Phragmites, methane concentrations within Scirpus stems did not change significantly over the diel period. These patterns are consistent with a two-way transport mechanism for Phragmites (convective at daytime and diffusive at night-time) and an all day diffusive mechanism for Scirpus. The patterns could not be accounted for by diel variation in air and sediment temperature, plant transpiration, or photosynthetically coupled methane production. Comparison of the experimentally derived ratio of methane emission in helium and nitrogen under light and dark conditions with the theoretical derived ratio (calculated according to the kinetic theory of gases) confirmed the exploitation of the different transport mechanism for Phragmites and Scirpus. Methane emission from Phragmites correlated significantly with incident light, which probably drove the pressure differential associated with thermally induced convection. Decrease of the radial resistance of Scirpus stems for methane transport under light compared to dark conditions, in combination with morphological characteristics of the plant species, suggested that stomatal aperture, regulated by light, controls methane emission from Scirpus. Diel variation in bubble emission from the non-vegetated sediment coincided with sediment temperature changes. The results have important implications for sampling and scaling strategies for estimating methane emission from wetlands.
20456458|The prediction of soil C stocks across the landscape has been increasingly studied in many areas of the world. Soil organic C storage in mountain areas is highly heterogeneous, mainly as a result of local-scale variability in the soil environment (topography, stoniness, parent material) and microclimate. The aims of the present study are to estimate soil organic C stocks (SOCS) in mineral soils of high-altitude grasslands of the Pyrenees and determine whether climatic and topographic variables can be used as predictors of SOCS and organic C content in the surface soil horizons of these ecosystems. For that purpose we sampled 35 soil profiles in subalpine and alpine grasslands including a range of altitudes, slopes and aspects. We analysed the soils for stoniness, bulk density, total C, texture, and C-to-N ratio and determined topographical variables. We used georeferenced climatic information for climatic descriptions of the sites. SOCS were highly correlated with soil depth. However, we were not able to predict soil depth by using environmental and topographic variables. In spite of this fact, altitude and aspect explained 41.2% of the SOCS variability while summer temperature and precipitation combined with aspect explained 56.9% of the variability of the organic C content of the surface layer (OC). The SOCS were low at high altitudes, probably as a result of an overall temperature limitation of net primary productivity. Under these conditions, the effect of aspect was small. The highest SOCS occurred at the lowest altitudes for ENE or WNW aspects, showing sharper decreases towards the south than to the north. The harsh climatic conditions and low-plant productivity that occur at the northern slopes reduced SOCS at the highest altitudes. In contrast, southern aspects showed similar organic C content along the altitudinal gradient. The OC variability in the surface soils not explained by climatic or topographic variables was partially related to the characteristics of soil organic matter, which may depend on the plant communities.
1469147|Solution chemistry profiles of mixed-conifer forests in granitic catchments of the Sierra Nevada were measured for three years before (1987-1990) and three years after (1990-1993) prescribed fire. Wet deposition, throughfall and soil solution samplers were installed in both white-fir and giant-sequoia dominated forest stands underlain by poorly developed inceptisols. Stream water chemistry was monitored as part of an ongoing study of catchment outputs. Calcium, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> were the major ions in precipitation. Canopy leaching increased mean concentrations of all major ions, especially K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Water flux through the soil occurred largely during spring snowmelt. Forest floor leachate represented the most concentrated solutions of major ions. Interaction with the mineral soil decreased mean concentrations of most species and the average composition of soil solutions closely resembled stream water at baseflow. Bicarbonate alkalinity, Ca<sup>2+</sup>,Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Na<sup>+</sup> were enriched in stream water relative to precipitation whereas inputs of H<sup>+</sup>,NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>,NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were retained within the catchments. Burning of the forest understory and litter layer increased solute concentrations in soil solution and stream water. Mean soil solution Ca<sup>2+</sup>,Mg<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations increased more than 10 fold, but the relative predominance of these cations was not affected by burning. Sulfate concentration, which was very low in soil solutions of undisturbed stands <latex>$(<25\ \text{mmol}_{c}\ \text{m}^{-3})$</latex>, increased more than 100 times following fire. Ammonium concentration exhibited a rapid, short-term increase and then a decrease below pre-burn levels. Changes in soil solution chemistry were reflected in catchment outputs.
20519793|While the global increase in the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers has been well recognized, another change in fertilizer usage has simultaneously occurred: a shift toward urea-based products. Worldwide use of urea has increased more than 100-fold in the past 4 decades and now constitutes &gt; 50% of global nitrogenous fertilizer usage. Global urea usage extends beyond agricultural applications; urea is also used extensively in animal feeds and in manufacturing processes. This change has occurred to satisfy the world's need for food and more efficient agriculture. Long thought to be retained in soils, new data are suggestive of significant overland transport of urea to sensitive coastal waters. Urea concentrations in coastal and estuarine waters can be substantially elevated and can represent a large fraction of the total dissolved organic nitrogen pool. Urea is used as a nitrogen substrate by many coastal phytoplankton and is increasingly found to be important in the nitrogenous nutrition of some harmful algal bloom (HAB) species. The global increase from 1970 to 2000 in documented incidences of paralytic shellfish poisoning, caused by several HAB species, is similar to the global increase in urea use over the same 3 decades. The trend toward global urea use is expected to continue, with the potential for increasing pollution of sensitive coastal waters around the world.
20456460|Increases in the growth rate of plants and microbes in the Mojave Desert in response to predicted increases in precipitation and CO due to global climate change may induce nutrient limitations. This study was designed to measure the pool of potentially bioavailable nutrients in soils of the Mojave Desert. Soils were collected from shrub and interspace microsites and then subjected to amendment with buffered solutions of an excess of various enzymes. The products of each enzyme reaction were then measured and the maximum quantity of hydrolyzable substrates was calculated. In interspace and shrub microsite soils, respectively, 14.5 and 9.7% of the organic C in the form cellulose, 60.0-97.8% and 61.2-100.0% of the organic N in the form protein, and 44.0 and 57.5% of the organic P was hydrolyzable. There were significant differences between microsites for hydrolyzable substrate using all enzyme amendments, except protease. We propose that accumulations of hydrolyzable organic C, N, and P in the Mojave Desert could be a result of the persistently dry soil conditions often found in desert ecosystems and the immobilization of enzymes, which may result in low diffusivity of soil substrates and enzymes and, accordingly, little degradation of organic C, N, and P. Alternatively, rapid nutrient cycling and immobilization by soil microorganisms could account for accumulations of organic C, N, and P. Further refinement of the methods used in this study could lead to a valuable tool for the assessment of potential bioavailability of nutrients in a variety of soils.
25652628|Northern hardwood forests in the eastern US exhibit species-specific influences on nitrogen (N) cycling, suggesting that their phosphorus (P) cycling characteristics may also vary by species. These characteristics are increasingly important to understand in light of evidence suggesting that atmospheric N deposition has increased N availability in the region, potentially leading to phosphorus limitation. We examined how P characteristics differ among tree species and whether these characteristics respond to simulated N deposition (fertilization). We added NHNO fertilizer (50 kg ha year) to single-species plots of red oak (Quercus rubra L.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.), in the Catskill Mountains, New York from 1997 to 2007. Species differences were observed in foliar, litter and root P concentrations, but all were unaffected by a cumulative N fertilization of 550 kg/ha. Similarly, measures of soil P availability and biotic P sufficiency differed by species but were unaffected by N fertilization. Results suggest species exhibit unique relationships to P as well as N cycles. We found little evidence that N fertilization leads to increased P limitation in these northern hardwood forests. However, species such as sugar maple and red oak may be sufficient in P, whereas beech and hemlock may be less sufficient and therefore potentially more sensitive to future N-stimulated P limitation.
24715199|We present 42 dual-isotope nitrate analyses of fresh water samples collected in the St. Lawrence River between June 2006 and July 2008. Measured N-NO and O-NO values correlate negatively, while O-NO displays no negative correlation with nitrate concentration. This suggests that nitrate uptake and/or elimination by denitrification is not the main driver of observed variations in nitrate concentration and isotopic signature in the St. Lawrence River. In addition, O-NO is negatively correlated with the seasonally variable O of ambient water, indicating that the variation in the isotopic signature of nitrate is barely modulated by in-stream nitrate regeneration (nitrification). It rather is constrained by along-river changes in the external sources of nitrate. Given the distinct nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotopic signature of atmospheric nitrate, we argue that observed seasonal variations of N-NO and O-NO in the St. Lawrence River are due to variable contributions of snowmelt-derived water. Based on a N and O isotope mass balance, we show that total nitrate loading in the St. Lawrence River is dominated by a N input from the Great Lakes (47  28 %) and from nitrate regeneration of both internal and external N (48  22 %). While temporal nitrate N and O isotope dynamics in the St. Lawrence River are mainly influenced by the atmospheric N input fluctuations, with an increase in atmospheric loading during spring, atmospheric N plays overall a rather insignificant role with regards to the N budget (5  4 %).
41490535|Amorphous, biogenic Si (ASi) is stored in large amounts in terrestrial ecosystems. The study of terrestrial ASi mobilization remains in the pioneer research stage: most Si budget studies have not included the biogenic amorphous Si stock and fluxes. This hampers our ability to accurately quantify terrestrial mobilization of Si, which is through ocean carbon burial and CO uptake during terrestrial Si weathering intricately linked to global carbon budgets. We studied detailed concentration and load patterns of dissolved (DSi) and ASi during several high-discharge events in eight first-order river basins. Based on high frequency discharge measurements and concurrent analysis of ASi and DSi concentrations at base flow and during intense precipitation events, we were able to attribute a percentage of yearly ASi and DSi fluxes to both base flow and precipitation event related surface run-off. Our results show ASi and DSi concentrations in upstream river basins to be intricately linked to each other and to discharge, and ASi transport constitutes an important part to the total transport of Si even through firstorder river basins (up to 40%). Based on our observations, increased occurrence of peak-discharge events with global climatic changes, and lowered importance of base flow, will coincide with drastic changes in ASi and DSi dynamics in the river continuum. Our work clearly shows ASi dynamics should be incorporated in global Si budgets now, even in low-order small river basins.
40343521|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streams draining hydrologically modified and intensively farmed watersheds has not been well examined, despite the importance of these watersheds to water quality issues and the potential of agricultural soils to sequester carbon. We investigated the dynamics of DOC for 14 months during 2006 and 2007 in 6 headwater streams in a heavily agricultural and tile-drained landscape in the midwestern US. We also monitored total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in the streams and tile drains. The concentrations of DOC in the streams and tile drains ranged from approximately 1-6 mg L; while concentrations of TDN, the composition of which averaged >94% nitrate, ranged from < 1 to > 10 mg L. Tile drains transported both DOC and TDN to the streams, but tile inputs of dissolved N were diluted by stream water, whereas DOC concentrations were generally greater in the streams than in tile drains. Filamentous algae were dense during summer base flow periods, but did not appear to contribute to the bulk DOC pool in the streams, based on diel monitoring. Short-term laboratory assays indicated that DOC in the streams was of low bioavailability, although DOC from tile drains in summer had bioavailability of 27%. We suggest that these nutrient-rich agricultural streams are wellsuited for examining how increased inputs of DOC, a potential result of carbon sequestration in agricultural soils, could influence ecosystem processes.
41490527|In-canopy mixing ratio gradients and above-canopy fluxes of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured using a commercial proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) in a European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest in Denmark. Fluxes of methanol were bidirectional: Emission occurred during both day and night with highest fluxes (0.2 mg C m h) during a warm period; deposition occurred dominantly at daytime. Confirming previous branch-level measurements on beech, the forest's monoterpene emissions (00.5 mg C m h), and in-canopy mixing ratios showed a diurnal cycle consistent with light-dependent emissions; a result contrasting temperature-only driven emissions of most conifer species. Also emitted was acetone, but only at ambient temperatures exceeding 20C. Slow deposition dominated at lower temperatures. Our in-canopy gradient measurements contrast with earlier results from tropical and pine forest ecosystems in that they did not show this beech ecosystem to be a strong sink for oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs). Instead, their gradients were flat and only small deposition velocities (<0.2 cm s) were observed to the onsite soil. However, as methanol soil uptake was consistent and possibly related to soil moisture, more measurements are needed to evaluate its soil sink strength. In turn, as canopy scale fluxes are net fluxes with stomatal emissions from photosynthesizing leaves potentially affecting non-stomatal oxygenated VOC uptake, only independent, controlled laboratory experiments may be successful in separating gross fluxes.
1469396|Forest harvesting alters the organic matter cycle by changing litter inputs and the decomposition regime. We hypothesized that these changes would result in differences in organic matter chemistry between clear-cut and uncut watershed ecosystems. We studied the chemistry of soil organic matter (SOM), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solutions and stream samples in clear-cut and uncut sites at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire using DOC fractionation techniques and solid-state <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Alkyl-C (aliphatic compounds) and O-alkyl-C (carbohydrates) were the largest C fractions in soil and dissolved organic matter at Hubbard Brook. Alkyl-C ranged from 29-48% of soil C, 25-42% of soil solution C, and 22-42% of streamwater DOC. Carbohydrates comprised 32-49%, 36-43%, and 29-60% of C in soils, solutions, and streamwater, respectively. In both soils and soil solutions, the carbohydrate fraction decreased with increasing soil depth, while the aromaticity of organic matter increased with depth. There were no significant differences in the structural chemistry of SOM between clear-cut and uncut watersheds. The aromatic-C fractions in soil solutions at the clear-cut site ranged from 12-16%, approximately 40% greater than at the uncut site (8.5-11%). Thus, clear-cutting has resulted in the leaching of more highly decomposed organic matter, and depletion of more aliphatic compounds in the soluble organic pool. Because DOC fluxes are small compared to the SOM pool, large differences in soil solution chemistry do not substantially alter the overall composition of SOM. While the organic chemistry of stream DOC varied greatly among 3 sampling dates, there were no obvious clear-cutting effects. Thus, temporal variations in flowpaths and/or in-stream processes appear to be more important than disturbance in regulating the organic carbon chemistry of these streams.

1469136| Recent rates of peat accretion (as determined by <sup>137</sup>Cs) and N, P, organic C, Ca and Na accumulation were measured along a 10 km eutrophication gradient in the northern Everglades area of Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA 2A) that has received agricultural drainage from the Hillsboro canal for the past 25-30 yrs. Rates of peat accretion were highest at sampling locations closest to the Hillsboro canal, 1.6 km downstream, (5.67  0.50 mm/yr) and decreased to 2.01  0.31 mm/yr at distances of 7.1 to 10.7 km downstream. Phosphorus and Na accumulation were a function of both peat accretion and soil P and Na concentrations. The concentration and accumulation of P in peat deposited in the past 26 years was highest near the Hillsboro canal (1478  67 ug/g, 0.66  0.06 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr) and decreased to 560  20 ug/g and 0.10  0.02 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr at distances of 8.8 to 10.7 km downstream. Like phosphorus, the concentration and rate of Na accumulation was highest near the Hillsboro canal (3205  1021 ug/g, 1.48  0.53 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr). Although sodium enrichment of the peat was limited to 1.6 km downstream of the Hillsboro canal, increased rates of Na accumulation penetrated 5.2 km downstream of the Hillsboro canal, the extent of the area of enhanced peat accretion. In contrast to P and Na, there was no difference in the concentration of soil organic C, N and Ca along the eutrophication gradient. However, there was a gradient of organic C, N and Ca accumulation corresponding to the area of enhanced peat accretion. The highest rates occurred 1.6 km south of the Hillsboro canal (212  5 g organic C/m<sup>2</sup>/yr, 14.1  0.4 g N/m<sup>2</sup>/yr, 22.1  5.2 g Ca/m<sup>2</sup>/yr). Accumulation of organic C, N and Ca at distances of 7.1 - 10.7 km downstream averaged 87  11, 6.3  0.7 and 6.5  0.9 g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr, respectively. The areal extent of enhanced peat accretion and organic C, N, Ca and Na accumulation encompasses approximately 7700 ha of the northern part of WCA 2A. The area of enhanced P accumulation is larger, covering 11,500 ha or 26% of the total area of WCA 2A. The 11,500 ha area has functioned as a sink for P for the past 25-30 yr removing 74% (49.3 MT/yr) of the 67 MT/yr that enters via agricultural drainage and rainfall. Moreover, P accumulation along the gradient was related to mean (1989-1990) surface water P concentration, decreasing as surface water P decreases. These findings suggest that P accumulation is dependent on the P concentration in the water column and that decreasing P loadings per unit area result in less P storage per unit area. The potential long-term equilibrium of the 11,500 ha area as a sink for P is based on a mean annual loading of 67 metric tons P/yr. Input rates exceeding this loading rate could result in an expansion of the 11,500 ha area until a new equilibrium size is reached. 
1469301|We investigate temporal changes in methane emissions over a three-year period from two peatlands in Michigan. Mean daily fluxes ranged from 0.6-68.4 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in plant communities dominated by Chamaedaphne calyculata, an ericaceous shrub, to CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in areas dominated by plants with aerenchymatous tissues, such as Carex oligosperma and Scheuchzeria palustris. Correlations between methane flux and water table position were significant at all sites for one annual cycle when water table fluctuations ranged from 15 cm above to 50 cm below the peat surface. Correlations were not significant during the second and third annual periods with smaller water table fluctuations. Methane flux was strongly correlated with peat temperatures at -5 to -40 cm (r<sub>S</sub>=0.82 to 0.98) for all three years at sites with flora acting as conduits for methane transport. At shrub sites, the correlations between methane flux and peat temperature were weak to not significant during the first two years, but were strong in the third year. Low rates of methane consumption (-0.2 to-1.5 mg CH<sub>4</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) were observed at shrub sites when the water table was below -20 cm, while sites with plants capable of methane transport always had positive net fluxes of methane. The methane oxidizing potential at both types of sites was confirmed by peat core experiments. The results of this study indicate that methane emissions occur at rates that cannot be explained by diffusion alone; plant communities play a significant role in altering methane flux from peatland ecosystems by directly transporting methane from anaerobic peat to the atmosphere.
1468505|We measured concentrations of soil nutrients (0-15 and 30-35 cm depths) before and after the dry season in control and dry-season irrigated plots of mature tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in central Panama to determine how soil moisture affects availability of plant nutrients. Dry-season irrigation (January through April in 1986, 1987, and 1988) enhanced gravimetric soil water contents to wet-season levels (ca.400 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) but did not cause leaching beyond 0.8 m depth in the soil. Irrigation increased concentrations of exchangeable base cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>,Mg<sup>2+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>,Na<sup>+</sup>), but it had little effect on concentrations of inorganic N (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>,NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and S (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>). These BCI soils had particularly low concentrations of extractable P especially at the end of the dry season in April, and concentrations increased in response to irrigation and the onset of the rainy season. We also measured the response of soil processes (nitrification and S mineralization) to irrigation and found that they responded positively to increased soil moisture in laboratory incubations, but irrigation had little effect on rates in the field. Other processes (plant uptake, soil organic matter dynamics) must compensate in the field and keep soil nutrient concentrations at relatively low levels.
1469107|Export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from forested catchments is governed by competing processes of production, decomposition, sorption and flushing. To examine the sources of DOC, carbon isotopes (<sup>14</sup>C and <sup>13</sup>C) were analyzed in DOC from surface waters, groundwaters and soils in a small forested catchment on the Canadian Shield in central Ontario. A significant fraction (greater than 50%) of DOC in major inflows to the lake is composed of carbon incorporated into organic matter, solubilized and flushed into the stream within the last 40 years. In contrast, <sup>14</sup>C in groundwater DOC was old indicating extensive recycling of forest floor derived organic carbon in the soil column before elution to groundwater in the lower B and C soil horizons. A small upland basin had a wide range in <sup>14</sup>C from old groundwater values at baseflow under dry basin conditions to relatively modern values during high flow or wetter antecedent conditions. Wetlands export mainly recently fixed carbon with little seasonal range. DOC in streams entering the small lake may be composed of two pools; an older recalcitrant pool delivered by groundwater and a young labile pool derived from recent organic matter. The relative proportion of these two pools changes seasonally due the changes in the water flowpaths and organic carbon dynamics. Although changes in local climate (temperature and/or precipitation) may alter the relative proportions of the old and young pools, the older pool is likely to be more refractory to sedimentation and decomposition in the lake setting. Delivery of older pool DOC from the catchment and susceptibility of this older pool to photochemical decomposition may consequently be important in governing the minimum DOC concentration limit in lakes.
23359739|Priming is an increase in soil organic carbon decomposition following input of labile organic carbon. In temperate soils where biological activity is limited commonly by nitrogen availability, priming is expected to occur through microbial acquisition of nitrogen from organic matter or stimulated activity of recalcitrant-carbon degrading microorganisms. However, these priming mechanisms have not yet been assessed in strongly weathered tropical forest soils where biological activity is often limited by the availability of phosphorus. We examined whether microbial nutrient limitation or community dynamics drive priming in three lowland tropical forest soils of contrasting fertility ('low', 'mid' and 'high') by applying C 4 -sucrose (alone or in combination with nutrients; nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and measuring (1) the  13 C-signatures in respired CO 2 and in phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers, and (2) the activities of enzymes involved in nitrogen (N-acetyl -glucosaminidase), phosphorus (phosphomonoesterase) and carbon (-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, xylanase, phenol oxidase) acquisition from organic compounds. Priming was constrained in part by nutrient availability, because priming was greater when sucrose was added alone compared to when added with nutrients. However, the greatest priming with sucrose addition alone was detected in the medium fertility soil. Priming occurred in parallel with stimulated activity of phosphomonoesterase and phenol oxidase (but not N-acetyl -glucosaminidase); when sucrose was added with nutrients there were lower activities of phosphomonoesterase and phenol oxidase. There was no evidence according to PLFA  13 C-incorporation that priming was caused by specific groups of recalcitrant-carbon degrading microorganisms. We conclude that priming occurred in the intermediate fertility soil following microbial mineralization of organic nutrients (phosphorus in particular) and suggest that priming was constrained in the high fertility soil by high nutrient availability and in the low fertility soil by the low concentration of soil organic matter amenable to priming. This first study of priming mechanisms in tropical forest soils indicates that input of labile carbon can result in priming by microbial mineralization of organic nutrients, which has important implications for understanding the fate of organic carbon in tropical forest soils.
20055207|By assessing current leaf litter nutrient dynamics, we may be able to predict responses of nutrient cycling in tropical ecosystems to future environmental change. The goal of this study was to assess whether nutrient cycling is related to seasonal variation in rainfall in a wet tropical forest. We examined leaf litter of an old-growth tropical rain forest in N. E. Costa Rica over a 4-year period to explore seasonal and inter-annual changes in leaf litter nutrient concentrations, and to evaluate potential short- and long-term drivers of variation in litter nutrient concentration, particularly that of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). We also examined the temporal dynamics of calcium, potassium, and magnesium in the leaf litter. Leaf litter [P] and %N changed significantly with time, both seasonally and inter-annually. Seasonal changes in leaf litter [P] were strongly positively correlated with rainfall from the previous 2 weeks; cations, however, were inversely related to this measure of current rainfall, while %N was not related to rainfall. We propose that the positive relationship between current rainfall and leaf litter [P] is due to a response by the vegetation to an increase in nutrient availability and uptake. In contrast, given the negative relationship between current rainfall and cation concentrations, leaching from live leaf tissue is a more likely driver of short-term changes in cations. Should global climate change include altered rainfall patterns in this biome, one class of ecosystem-level responses could be significant changes in P and cation cycling.
1469409| We estimated the fluxes, inputs and outputs of Ca, K, and Mg in a Mexican tropical dry forest. The study was conducted in five contiguous small watersheds (12-28 ha) gauged for long-term ecosystem research. A total of five 80  30 m plots were used for the study. We quantified inputs from the atmosphere, dissolved and particulate-bound losses, throughfall and litterfall fluxes, and standing crop litter pools. Mean cation inputs for a six-year period were 3.03 kg/ha for Ca, 1.31 kg/ha for K, and 0.80 kg/ha for Mg. Mean outputs in runoff were 5.24, 2.83, and 1.79 kg/ha, respectively. Calcium, K, and Mg concentrations increased as rainfall moved through the canopy. Annual Ca return in the litterfall (11.4 g/m<sup>2</sup>) was much higher than K (2.3 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and Mg (1.6 g/m<sup>2</sup>). Litterfall represented 99% of the Ca, 84% of the Mg, and 53% of the K, total aboveground return to the soil. Calcium concentration in standing litter (3.87%) was much higher than K (0.38%) and Mg (0.37%). These concentrations were higher (Ca), lower (K), or similar (Mg) to those in litterfall. Residence times on the forest floor were 0.86, 1.17, and 1.77 yr for K, Mg, and Ca respectively. Compared to the residence time for organic matter at the site (1.31 yr), these results suggest slow mineralization for Ca in this ecosystem. Budget estimates were calculated for a wet and a dry year. Results indicated that nutrients accumulated in the dry but that nutrients were lost during the wet year. Comparison of Ca, K, and Mg losses in stream water with the input rates from the atmosphere for the six-year period show that inputs are lower than outputs in the Chamela tropical dry forest ecosystem. 
24715358|Recent measurements have demonstrated unprecedented increase in atmospheric deposition of nutrients in many parts of India. To determine whether atmospheric nutrient inputs would increase phytoplankton growth and catchment dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flushing to constrain benthic algae, we analyzed NO and ${{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{O}}_{4}^{-3}}$ in atmospheric deposits; nutrients and DOC in runoff and lake water and standing crop biomass of phytoplankton and periphyton at Jaisamand Lake of Rajasthan, India. Atmospheric deposition of NO (7.1829.95 kg ha year) and ${{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{O}}_{4}^{-3}}$ (0.562.15 kg ha year) showed a consistently rising trend across the year. Microbial biomass and activity in catchment increased in response to atmospheric deposition. Lake DOC and nutrients showed strong coherence with their terrestrial and atmospheric fluxes. Phytoplankton development showed significant linearity with atmospheric input of nutrients. Air-driven input appeared to have compensated the nutrient constraints to phytoplankton during drought. The N:P stoichiometry of deposition and that of lake water indicated that, although there was a seasonal switchover to N- or P-limitation, phytoplankton were mainly co-limited by N and P due probably to the synergistic effects of combined N + P enrichment in the pelagic zone of the lake. Periphyton standing crop showed inverse relationship with phytoplankton and lake DOC. The study indicated that enhanced phytoplankton development and terrestrial DOC flushing in response to atmospheric nutrient input attenuated light penetration to constrain algal periphyton. We suggests that data on these issues may be considered in developing aquatic ecosystem models to establish future links between changing airwaterland interactions and associated shifts in lake ecosystem functioning for more accurately predicting climate change drivers and designing integrated lake basin management strategies.
41490479|We compared the CO exchange and its controls in the plant communities of a strongly patterned aapa mire, the Kaamanen fen in northern Finland. Based on a systematic vegetation inventory and an ordination analysis, four plant community types were chosen for the study: Ericales-Pleurozium string tops, Betula-Sphagnum string margins, Trichophorum tussock flarks and Carex-Scorpidium wet flarks. We measured plant community CO exchange with a closed chamber technique during the growing season of 2007 and early summer of 2008. Nonlinear regression models were used for simulating the CO exchange over the measurement period for different mire components and for the whole mire. The CO exchange dynamics distinguished two functional components in the mire: an ombrotrophic component (Ericales-Pleurozium string tops) and a minerotrophic component (other plant community types). Minerotrophic plant communities responded similarly to environmental controls, the most important of these being variation in leaf area and aerobic peat volume (water level). The ombrotrophic component dynamics were more obscure; frost and possibly peat moisture played a role. The minerotrophic communities functioned as effective CO sinks in the simulation, while the net CO exchange of the ombrotrophic community was close to zero. The smaller NEE of the ombrotrophic community was due to less efficient photosynthesis per unit leaf area in combination with high ecosystem respiration resulting from a large aerobic peat volume. Our study shows that a fen/bog functional dichotomy can also exist within one mire. Wet minerotrophic communities within northern mires can act as effective CO sinks.
20456402|The chemical composition and carbon isotope signature of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in five boreal forest catchments in Scandinavia were investigated. The DOM was isolated during spring and fall seasons using a reverse osmosis technique. The DOM samples were analyzed by elemental analysis, FT-IR, solid-state CP-MAS C-NMR, and C-1s NEXAFS spectroscopy. In addition, the relative abundance of carbon isotopes (C, C, C) in the samples was measured. There were no significant differences in the chemical composition or carbon isotope signature of the DOM sampled in spring and fall seasons. Also, differences in DOM composition between the five catchments were minor. Compared to reference peat fulvic and humic acids, all DOM samples were richer in O-alkyl carbon and contained less aromatic and phenolic carbon, as shown by FT-IR, C-NMR, and C-1s NEXAFS spectroscopy. The DOM was clearly enriched in C relative to the NBS oxalic acid standard of 1950, indicating that the aquatic DOM contained considerable amounts of organic carbon younger than about 50 years. The weight-based C:N ratios of 31  6 and the C values of -29  2 indicate that the isolated DOM is of terrestrial rather than aquatic origin. We conclude that young, hydrophilic carbon compounds of terrestrial origin are predominant in the samples investigated, and that the composition of the aquatic DOM in the studied boreal forest catchments is rather stable during low to intermediate flow conditions.
1468639|Litter is decomposed in a sequential process. In a concerted action animals and microorganisms break down complex organic matter to mineral products. Higher animals fragment and partially solubilize plant material. Subsequently, microorganisms (protozoa, fungi and bacteria) further degrade the organic matter to end products that cannot be metabolized further under the prevailing environmental conditions. During the process of decomposition some parts of the organic substrate and the excess energy are used to form new biomass. Some free organic intermediates may interact chemically to form relatively recalcitrant organic matter, such as humic substances. The degree of mineralization depends strongly on the type of organic matter in the litter and the physical and chemical conditions of the environment.
24715338|A mass balance of dissolved silica (DSi) based on daily measurements at the inflow and outflow of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in 2007 and a more precise budget, with inflow, outflow, primary production, biogenic silica (BSi) settlement, dissolution of BSi in the water column and flux of DSi at the sedimentwater interface in the dry season (April) of 2007 were developed. We address the following question: How much does the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) affect silica transport in the TGR of the Changjiang River (Yangtze River)? The DSi varied from 71.1 to 141 mol/l with an average of 108 mol/1, and it ranged between 68.1 and 136 mol/l, with an average of 107 mol/l in inflow and outflow, respectively, in the TGR in 2007. The linear relationship of DSi between inflow and outflow water is significant (r = 0.87, n = 362, p < 0.01). Along the main stream of the TGR, the DSi concentration decreases with an average concentration of 84.0 mol/l in the dry season. However, the stratification of DSi was not obvious in the main channel of the TGR in the dry season. The BSi is within the range of 0.045.00 mol/l, with an average concentration of 2.1 mol/l in the main channel of the TGR, while it is much higher in Xiangxi Bay (1.3047.7 mol/l, 13.1 mol/l) than in the main stream of the TGR and the other bays. After the third filling of the TGR, approximately 3.8% of the DSi was retained by the TGR based on a 12-month monitoring scheme in 2007, which would slightly reduce nutrient fluxes of the Changjiang River to the East China Sea (2%). DSi was lost during January to June and November, whereas the additions of DSi were found during the other months in 2007. The budget results also indicate that there is a slight retention of DSi. The retention of DSi in the reservoir is approximately 2.9%, while BSi is approximately 44%. Compared with the total silica load, the retention of DSi and BSi in the reservoir is only 5.0% in the dry season. With its present storage capacity, the reservoir does not play an important role as a silica sink in the channel of the TGR. The DSi load is significantly related to discharge both in inflow and outflow waters (p < 0.01). DSi retention, to some extent, is the runoff change due to impoundment.
23359754|The kinetics and elemental composition of cellular units that mediate production and respiration are the basis for the metabolic and stoichiometric theories of ecological organization. This theoretical framework extends to the activities of microbial enzymes released into the environment (ecoenzymes) that mediate the release of assimilable substrate from detrital organic matter. In this paper, we analyze the stoichiometry of ecoenzymatic activities in the surface sediments of lotic ecosystems and compare those results to the stoichiometry observed in terrestrial soils. We relate these ecoenzymatic ratios to energy and nutrient availability in the environment as well as microbial elemental content and growth efficiency. The data, collected by US Environmental Protection Agency, include the potential activities of 11 enzymes for 2,200 samples collected across the US, along with analyses of sediment C, N and P content. On average, ecoenzymatic activities in stream sediments are 25 times greater per gC than those of terrestrial soils. Ecoenzymatic ratios of C, N and P acquisition activities support elemental analyses showing that microbial metabolism is more likely to be C-limited than N or P-limited compared to terrestrial soils. Ratios of hydrolytic to oxidative activities indicate that sediment organic matter is more labile than soil organic matter and N acquisition is less dependent on humic oxidation. The mean activity ratios of glycosidases and aminopeptidases reflect the environmental abundance of their respective substrates. For both freshwater sediments and terrestrial soils, the mean C:nutrient ratio of microbial biomass normalized to growth efficiency approximates the mean ecoenzymatic C:nutrient activity ratios normalized to environmental C:nutrient abundance. This relationship defines a condition for biogeochemical equilibrium consistent with stoichiometric and metabolic theory.
1468720|We provide an assessment of the global sources of NH<sub>3</sub> in the atmosphere, which indicates an annual flux of about 75 Tg of N as NH<sub>3</sub>. The emissions from land are dominated by the release of NH<sub>3</sub> during the hydrolysis of urea from the urine of domestic animals (32 TgN/yr) and by emanations from soils in unmanaged ecosystems (10 TgN/yr) and from fertilized agricultural soils (9 TgN/yr). Emissions from the sea surface may approach 13 TgN/yr. The total annual source of NH<sub>3</sub> is in reasonable agreement with estimates of global NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> deposition from the atmosphere, the major fate of atmospheric NH<sub>3</sub>. As an alkaline atmospheric species, NH<sub>3</sub> emitted to the atmosphere each year can neutralize only about 32% of the annual production of H<sup>+</sup> in the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic sources.
1469366|We used 16 soils to compare the Hedley method for soil phosphorus fractionation to an alternative method recently developed by Ruttenberg to differentiate among P fractions in marine sediments. For forms of labile and Fe-bound P in soils, these methods were poorly correlated, with the Hedley fractionation showing a greater ability to discriminate among variations in plant-available P. For Ca-bound P, total organic P, and total P, the methods were well correlated (r<sup>2</sup>=0.93, 0.48, 0.74, respectively), although the sum of P measured in the Ruttenberg extractions is only 45% of the total P recovered by the Hedley fractionation. The Hedley fractionation seems superior when an index of plant-available phosphorus and a separation of organic and inorganic forms is needed, whereas the Ruttenberg method allows a separation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>-bound P from apatite-P, which is potentially useful in calcareous soils.
24715123|This paper shows that the sub-surface light regime in the offshore North Sea varies spatially and seasonally between different ecohydrodynamic regions, which is likely to have important implications for primary production and carbon and nutrient fluxes in different areas of the North Sea. Measurements of downward irradiance were collected using different instruments (i.e. water column-profiling instruments, semi-autonomous moorings, and remote sensing) at three ecohydrodynamically distinct sites in the North Sea: in the southern Bight (SB), at the Oyster Grounds (OG) and north of the Dogger Bank (ND). The ND site was the deepest, and had the lowest and least variable light attenuation coefficients (mean Kd(PAR) = 0.11 m). The onset of the phytoplankton spring bloom was earlier than at the other two sites. In summer, ND had low Kd(PAR)  0.07 m and light penetration was shifted towards blue-green wavelengths (490560 nm), with water itself being one of the strongest contributors to overall attenuation. In contrast, the SB site was characterised by the highest and most variable values of Kd(PAR) (mean = 0.54 m), comparable to near-coastal waters, and the spring bloom started almost a month later than at the ND site. The vertical variability of the attenuation coefficient and the strong PAR attenuation in the blue region of the spectrum were the result of higher concentrations of phytoplankton, CDOM and SPM, due to riverine inputs, shallow depth and strong tidal mixing. The OG site showed intermediate conditions between the ND and SB sites with a mean Kd(PAR) = 0.23 m, and deepest penetration of irradiance in the green region of the spectrum at 560 nm. The implications of these results for phytoplankton growth and ecosystem modelling are discussed.
20055279|We examined patterns of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) loading to a small urban stream during baseflow and stormflow. We hypothesized that lower DOC and TDN contributions from impervious surfaces would dilute natural hydrologic flowpath (i.e., riparian) contributions during storm events in an urban watershed, resulting in lower concentrations of DOC and TDN during storms. We tested these hypotheses in a small urban watershed in Portland, Oregon, over a 3-month period during the spring of 2003. We compared baseflow and stormflow chemistry using Mann--Whitney tests (significant at p &lt 0.05). We also applied a mass balance to the stream to compare the relative significance of impervious surface contributions versus riparian contributions of DOC and TDN. Results showed a significant increase in stream DOC concentrations during stormflows (median baseflow DOC = 2.00 mg
24715130|The marine ecosystem response to climate change and demersal trawling was investigated using the coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical water column model GOTM-ERSEM-BFM for three contrasting sites in the North Sea. Climate change forcing was derived from the HadRM3-PPE-UK regional climate model for the UK for the period 19502100 using historical emissions and a medium emissions scenario (SRESA1B). Effects of demersal trawling were implemented as an additional mortality on benthic fauna, and changes in the benthicpelagic nutrient and carbon fluxes. The main impacts of climate change were (i) a temperature-driven increase in pelagic metabolic rates and nutrient cycling, (ii) an increase in primary production fuelled by recycled nutrients, (iii) a decrease in benthic biomass due to increased benthic metabolic rates and decreased food supply as a result of the increased pelagic cycling, and (iv) a decrease in near-bed oxygen concentrations. The main impacts of trawling were (i) reduced benthic biomass due to the increased mortality, and (ii) the increased benthicpelagic nutrient fluxes, with these effects counteracting each other, and relatively small changes in other variables. One important consequence was a large decrease in the de-nitrification flux predicted at the two summer-stratified sites because less benthic nitrate was available. The effects of trawling scaled linearly with fishing effort, with greatest sensitivity to fishing in summer compared to fishing in winter. The impacts of climate change and trawling were additive, suggesting little or no non-linear interactions between these disturbances.

24716787|Long-term elevated atmogenic deposition (5 g m year) of reactive nitrogen (N) causes N saturation in forests of subtropical China which may lead to high nitrous oxide (NO) emissions. Recently, we found high NO emission rates (up to 1,730 g NO-N m h) during summer on well-drained acidic acrisols (pH = 4.0) along a hill slope in the forested Tieshanping catchment, Chongqing, southwest China. Here, we present results from an in situ NNO labeling experiment to assess the contribution of nitrification and denitrification to NO emissions in these soils. Two loads of 99 at.% KNO (equivalent to 0.2 and 1.0 g N m) were applied as a single dose to replicated plots at two positions along the hill slope (at top and bottom, respectively) during monsoonal summer. During a 6-day period after label application, we found that 71100 % of the emitted NO was derived from the labeled NO pool irrespective of slope position. Based on this, we assume that denitrification is the dominant process of NO formation in these forest soils. Within 6 days after label addition, the fraction of the added NNO emitted as NNO was highest at the low-N addition plots (0.2 g N m, amounting to 1.3 % at the top position of the hill slope and to 3.2 % at the bottom position, respectively. Our data illustrate the large potential of acid forest soils in subtropical China to form NO from excess NO most likely through denitrification.
23359727|Proper management of soil organic matter (SOM) is needed for maintaining soil fertility and for mitigation of the global increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and should be informed by knowledge about the sources, spatial organisation and stabilisation processes of SOM. Recently, microbial biomass residues (i.e. necromass) have been identified as a significant source of SOM. Here, we propose that cell wall envelopes of bacteria and fungi are stabilised in soil and contribute significantly to small-particulate SOM formation. This hypothesis is based on the mass balance of a soil incubation experiment with 13 C-labelled bacterial cells and on the visualisation of the microbial residues by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). At the end of a 224-day incubation, 50% of the biomass-derived C remained in the soil, mainly in the non-living part of SOM (40% of the added biomass C). SEM micrographs only rarely showed intact cells. Instead, organic patchy fragments of 200500 nm size were abundant and these fragments were associated with all stages of cell envelope decay and fragmentation. Similar fragments, developed on initially clean and sterile in situ microcosms during exposure to groundwater, provide clear evidence for their formation during microbial growth and surface colonisation. Microbial cell envelope fragments thus contribute significantly to SOM formation. This origin and the related macromolecular architecture of SOM are consistent with most observations on SOM, including the abundance of microbial-derived biomarkers, the low C/N ratio, the water repellency and the stabilisation of biomolecules, which in theory should be easily degradable.
1469613|Decomposition rates and nutrient dynamic (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) were determined for green leaves and fine branches immersed in the water of a small tributary of Caura river (SE-Venezuela). 16% of the original dry weight of leaves and 11% of branches were lost at the end of the first sampling period: first month for leaves and second month for branches. This dry weight reduction was probably due to leaching of soluble material. After a 9-month period, the mass loss was 60% for leaves and 20% for fine branches. The pattern of dry weight and nutrient losses are in general agreement with previous studies of decomposition of leaf litter in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Potassium and magnesium are the elements most rapidly lost, showing the dominance of leaching processes; at the end of the first month 7% of the initial amount of K and 18% of the initial amount of Mg remained in leaves. The loss of calcium and phosphorus was much slower: 61% of Ca and 47% of P remained in the leaf material after the first sampling period. In contrast to K, Mg, Ca and P, the initial amount of nitrogen in leaves remained relatively unchanged during the first month of decomposition; in the subsequent sampling period, the amount of N decreased. The elements K and Mg in branches behaved similar to leaves: 4% of K and 22% of Mg were left at the end of the first sampling period. The initial amount of Ca and P in branches decreased slightly: 88% of Ca and 83% of P remained in branches at the end of this first sampling. Nitrogen behaved differently in branches than that in leaves. In branches the amount of N remained relatively unchanged during the first 5 months of decomposition; afterwards, N showed gradual increases, probably due to immobilization. At the end of the experiment the amount of N in branches was 16% higher than the initial amount.
41490426|To focus conservation efforts into forest areas with high biodiversity, more information is needed about soil-vegetation dependencies in Finnish Lapland. We studied understory vegetation and soil variables along a transect across a felsic-mafic lithological sequence in central Finnish Lapland. At 119 northern boreal forest sites, coverages of understory vegetation, several mineral soil chemical elements, soil electrical conductivity, pH, and dielectric permittivity, as a measure of soil volumetric water content, were measured. We found that soil Ca concentration and Ca: Al ratio were the main variables determining vegetation composition and diversity. Ca-rich soils were characterised by high electrical conductivity, pH, and Mg concentration, and by low concentration of Al, S, Zn, and low C: N ratio. Soil Ca concentration is a diagnostic measure of plant diversity as concentration higher than 100 mg kg resulted in a considerable increase in plant diversity. Sites with Ca concentration this high were rare, and probably important in maintaining high biodiversity. The median soil Ca: Al ratio was only 0.02, suggesting, according to general theory, a considerable risk for aluminium stress. We found Geranium sylvaticum and Rubus saxatilis to be good indicators for Ca-rich regimes and high plant diversity.
23359704|Coral zooxanthellae contain high concentrations of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), the precursor of dimethylsulphide (DMS), an aerosol substance that could affect cloud cover, solar radiation and ocean temperatures. Acropora intermedia a dominant staghorn coral in the Indo-Pacific region, contain some of the highest concentrations of DMSP reported in the literature but no studies have shown that corals produce atmospheric DMS in situ and thus could potentially participate in sea surface temperature (SST) regulation over reefs; or how production varies during coral bleaching. We show that A. intermedia from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) produces significant amounts of atmospheric DMS, in chamber experiments, indicating that coral reefs in this region could contribute to an "ocean thermostat" similar to that described for the western Pacific warm pool, where significantly fewer coral reefs have bleached during the last 25 years because of a cloud-SST feedback. However, when Acropora intermedia was stressed with higher light levels and seawater temperatures DMSP production, an indicator of zooxanthellae expulsion, increased markedly in the chamber, whilst atmospheric DMS emissions almost completely shut down. These results suggest that during increased light levels and seawater temperatures in the GBR coral shut-down atmospheric DMS aerosol production, potentially increasing solar radiation levels over reefs and exacerbating coral bleaching.
41490486|The flowpaths by which water moves from watersheds to streams has important consequences for the runoff dynamics and biogeochemistry of surface waters in the Amazon Basin. The clearing of Amazon forest to cattle pasture has the potential to change runoff sources to streams by shifting runoff to more surficial flow pathways. We applied end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) to 10 small watersheds throughout the Amazon in which solute composition of streamwater and groundwater, overland flow, soil solution, throughfall and rainwater were measured, largely as part of the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia. We found a range in the extent to which streamwater samples fell within the mixing space determined by potential flowpath endmembers, suggesting that some water sources to streams were not sampled. The contribution of overland flow as a source of stream flow was greater in pasture watersheds than in forest watersheds of comparable size. Increases in overland flow contribution to pasture streams ranged in some cases from 0% in forest to 27-28% in pasture and were broadly consistent with results from hydrometric sampling of Amazon forest and pasture watersheds that indicate 17- to 18-fold increase in the overland flow contribution to stream flow in pastures. In forest, overland flow was an important contribution to stream flow (45-57%) in ephemeral streams where flows were dominated by stormflow. Overland flow contribution to stream flow decreased in importance with increasing watershed area, from 21 to 57% in forest and 60-89% in pasture watersheds of less than 10 ha to 0% in forest and 27-28% in pastures in watersheds greater than 100 ha. Soil solution contributions to stream flow were similar across watershed area and groundwater inputs generally increased in proportion to decreases in overland flow. Application of EMMA across multiple watersheds indicated patterns across gradients of stream size and land cover that were consistent with patterns determined by detailed hydrometric sampling.
20456527|Studies of changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks normally limit their focus to the upper 20-30 cm of soil, yet 0-20 cm SOC stocks are only 40% of 0-1 m SOC. Accounting for only the upper 20-30 cm of SOC has been justifiable assuming that deeper SOC is unreactive since it displays C-derived mean residence times of hundreds or thousands of years. The dramatic increase in the C content of the atmosphere resulting from thermonuclear testing circa 1963 allows the unreactivity of deep SOC to be tested by examining whether deep soils show evidence of 'bomb-C' incorporation. At depths of 40-100 cm, a well-studied New Zealand soil under stable pastoral management displays progressive enrichment of over 200 across samplings in 1959, 1974 and 2002, indicating substantial incorporation of bomb C. This pattern of deep C enrichment--previously observed in 2 well-drained California grassland soils--leads to the hypothesis that roots and/or dissolved organic C transport contribute to a decadally-reactive SOC pool comprising 10-40% of SOC below 50 cm. Deep reactive SOC may be important in the global C cycle because it can react to land-use or vegetation change and may respond to different processes than the reactive SOC in the upper 20-30 cm of soil.
20055217|In many arid and semi-arid ecosystems, canopy trees and shrubs have a strong positive influence on soil moisture and nutrient availability, creating islands of fertility where organic matter and nutrients are high relative to areas outside the canopy. Previous studies of canopy effects on soil processes have rarely considered how landscape context may modulate these effects. We measured the effects of velvet mesquite trees (Prosopis velutina) on soil moisture and the biogeochemistry of nitrogen at different positions along a topographic gradient from upland desert to riparian zone in the Sonoran Desert of central Arizona. We also examined how landscape position and patterns of precipitation interact to determine the influence of P. velutina on soil moisture, N availability assessed using ion exchange resins, net N mineralization and net nitrification, and microbial biomass C and N. P. velutina clearly created islands of fertility with higher soil organic matter, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates, and microbial biomass under mesquite canopies. These effects were consistent across the landscape and showed little temporal variability. Magnitude and direction of effect of mesquite on soil moisture changed with landscape position, from positive in the upland to negative in the terrace, but only when soil moisture was &gt4%. Resin N showed responses to mesquite that depended on precipitation and topographic position, with highest values during wet seasons and under mesquite on terraces. We suggest changes in proximity of P. velutina to groundwater lead to shifts in biogeochemical processes and species interactions with change in landscape position along a topographic gradient.
41490536|The nitrogen (N) budget calculation approach is a useful means of evaluating the impact of human activity on the N cycle. Field scale N budget calculations may ignore the interactions between landscapes, and regional scale calculations rely on statistical data and indirect parameters. Watershed scale budget calculations allow for a more direct quantification of N inputs and outputs. We conducted N budget calculations for a rice paddydominated agricultural watershed in eastern China for 2007-2009, based on intensive monitoring of stream N dynamics, atmospheric deposition, ammonia (NH) volatilization and household interviews about Nrelated agricultural activities. The results showed that although total N input to the watershed was up to 280 kg N ha year, riverine discharge was only 4.2 kg N ha year, accounting for 1.5% of the total N input, and was further reduced to 2.0 kg N ha year after reservoir storage and/or denitrification removal. The low riverine N output was because of the characteristics of the rice paddydominated landscape, which intercepts run-off and enhances soil denitrification. The watershed actually purified the N in rainwater, as N concentrations in river discharge were much lower than those in rain water. Major N outputs included food/feed export, NH 3 volatilization from chemical fertilizer and manure, and emissions from crop residue burning. Net reactive gaseous emissions (emissions minus deposition) accounted for 5.5% of the total N input, much higher than riverine discharge. Therefore, the agricultural N cycle in such paddy-dominated watersheds impacts the environment mainly through gas exchange rather than water discharge.
1468526|Laboratory incubations of <sup>15</sup>N-amended soils from a sagebrush steppe in southcentral Wyoming indicate that nutrient turnover and availability have complex patterns across the landscape and between microsites. Total and available N and P and microbial C and N were highest in topographic depressions characterized by tall shrub communities. Net and gross N mineralization rates and respiration were also highest in these areas, but microbial efficiencies expressing growth relative to respiration cost were highest in soils of exposed ridgetop sites (prostrate shrub communities). Similar patterns occurred between shrub and intershrub soils, with greater nutrient availability under shrubs, but lower microbial efficiencies under shrubs than between. Surface soils had higher soil nutrient pools and N mineralization rates than subsurface soils, but N and C turnover and microbial efficiencies were lower in those surface soils. All soils decreased in respiration, mineralization, and immobilization rates during the 30-day incubation period, apparently approaching a steady-state substrate use. Soil microbial activity of the high organic matter accumulation areas was apparently more limited by labile substrate.
1468630|The parent material of a soil determines the original supply of those nutrient elements that are released by weathering and influences the balance between nutrient loss and retention. Organic acids and exudates produced by microorganisms and plants enhance the weathering of minerals and the release of nutrients. Nutrients may be stored in organic cycles or as ions adsorbed to clay and organic matter. Nutrients are lost mainly by leaching, both as dissolved ions and when associated with soluble organic components. Soil formation evidently affects these processes and modifies the environment at different depths as soil horizons develop. Strong interactions between mineral and organic colloids occur where most residues are added below ground, as in grasslands, or mixed with mineral soil by faunal activity, as in some forests. These systems tend to be nutrient conserving. The addition of organic residues to the soil surface often results in slow decomposition, the tie-up of many nutrients in biologically resistant humic materials, and the generation of organic acids that are active in leaching and chelation. These soils tend to lose nutrients by leaching and become strongly acidic with time. Leaching is strongest in uplands with net downward flows to deep water tables, and may be dampened or obviated in lowlands with strong upward fluxes due to artesian pressure or capillary rise from a water table that is close to the surface. Pedogenic features such as clayey B horizons or duripans may alter water flow. Simonson's concepts that all basic soil-forming processes occur to some degree in all soils are critical to developing models describing soil formation and nutrient cycles.
24715186|The exudation of carbon (C) by tree roots stimulates microbial activity and the production of extracellular enzymes in the rhizosphere. Here, we investigated whether the strength of rhizosphere processes differed between temperate forest trees that vary in soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry and associate with either ectomycorrhizal (ECM) or arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We measured rates of root exudation, microbial and extracellular enzyme activity, and nitrogen (N) availability in samples of rhizosphere and bulk soil influenced by four temperate forest tree species (i.e., to estimate a rhizosphere effect). Although not significantly different between species, root exudation ranged from 0.36 to 1.10 g C m day, representing a small but important transfer of C to rhizosphere microbes. The magnitude of the rhizosphere effects could not be easily characterized by mycorrhizal associations or SOM chemistry. Ash had the lowest rhizosphere effects and beech had the highest rhizosphere effects, representing one AM and one ECM species, respectively. Hemlock and sugar maple had equivalent rhizosphere effects on enzyme activity. However, the form of N produced in the rhizosphere varied with mycorrhizal association. Enhanced enzyme activity primarily increased amino acid availability in ECM rhizospheres and increased inorganic N availability in AM rhizospheres. These results show that the exudation of C by roots can enhance extracellular enzyme activity and soil-N cycling. This work suggests that global changes that alter belowground C allocation have the potential to impact the form and amount of N to support primary production in ECM and AM stands.
1469506|Evaporation ponds in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV), CA, USA that are used for the disposal of irrigation drainage waters, contain elevated levels of U that may be a threat to pond wildlife. The ponds support euryhaline algae, which become incorporated in the sediments as depositional organic matter (OM) -- facilitating reducing conditions. Our earlier studies have shown that U in one SJV sediment was primarily present as the highly soluble U(VI) species (as opposed to the less soluble U(IV) species), despite the presence of volatile sulfides. In this research, we investigated the effects of native pond algae (Chlorella) and potential reducing agents on U redox chemistry of SJV pond sediments. San Joaquin Valley pond sediments were equilibrated with natural and synthetic pond inlet waters containing approximately 10 mg U(VI) L<sup>-1</sup> to which reducing agents (acetate, sucrose, and alfalfa shoot) were added. The equilibrations were done under oxic (Chlorella only) and O<sub>2</sub>-limiting conditions (remaining treatments). Sediments were examined for changes in average U oxidation state by X-ray near-edge absorption structure (XANES) spectroscopy and U concentration by ICP-MS. For the alfalfa treatments, a 95 percent loss of U(VI) from solution, the presence of sulfides, and results from the XANES studies suggest U(VI) was reduced to U(IV). Upon exposure to air, the precipitated U was readily oxidized, suggesting the reduced U is susceptible to oxidation. Much less reduction of U(VI) was observed in the other 3 treatments and the solid phase was dominated by U(VI) as in the natural pond sediments. A second study was conducted with pond sediment-water suspensions to determine the effects of controlled PCO<sub>2</sub> and low redox potential (Eh) on U solubility. These suspensions were equilibrated at 0.22 and 5.26 kPa PCO<sub>2</sub> and allowed to "free-drift" from an oxidized to a reduced state. At high Eh and high PCO<sub>2</sub>, dissolved U concentrations were higher than in the low PCO<sub>2</sub> systems due to greater complexation with CO<sub>3</sub>. Dissolved U concentrations decreased only under intense sulfate reducing conditions, even at low Eh conditions. It appears that U reduction occurred by chemical reduction via sulfide ion. Comparing the XANES data of the pond sediments with the laboratory-produced solids we conclude that biosorption by algae and bacteria is the dominant mechanism depositing U in the sediments. Even though there are organisms that can use U(VI) as a terminal electron acceptor, we found that sulfate reduction was preferred in these high-SO<sub>4</sub> waters. Mixed oxidation state U-solids were preferentially formed in the pond sediments and in the lab except under intense SO<sub>4</sub> reducing conditions.
41410584|The DyDOC model was used to simulate the soil carbon cycle of a deciduous forest at the Oak Ridge Reservation (Tennessee, USA). The model application relied on extensive data from the Enriched Background Isotope Study (EBIS), which exploited a short-term local atmospheric enrichment of radiocarbon to establish a large-scale manipulation experiment with different inputs of C from both above-ground and below-ground litter. The model was first fitted to hydrological data, then observed pools and fluxes of carbon and C data were used to fit parameters describing metabolic transformations of soil organic matter (SOM) components and the transport and sorption of dissolved organic matter (DOM). This produced a detailed quantitative description of soil C cycling in the three horizons (O, A, B) of the soil profile. According to the parameterised model, SOM turnover within the thin O-horizon rapidly produces DOM (46 gC m a), which is predominantly hydrophobic. This DOM is nearly all adsorbed in the A-and B-horizons, and while most is mineralised relatively quickly, 11 gC m a undergoes a "maturing" reaction, producing mineral-associated stable SOM pools with mean residence times of 100-200 years. Only a small flux (~1 gC m a) of hydrophilic DOM leaves the B-horizon. The SOM not associated with mineral matter is assumed to be derived from root litter, and turns over quite quickly (mean residence time 20-30 years). Although DyDOC was successfully fitted to C pools, annual fluxes and C data, it accounted less well for short-term variations in DOC concentrations.
1469832|Samples of the fraction of net rainfall passing through the forest floor collected at monthly intervals in four pristine forests in Colombian Amazonia, during the period between 1995-1997 were analysed for solute concentrations to estimate the element fluxes from the forest floor into the mineral soil and root nutrient uptake from these forest floors. Results were compared with inputs by throughfall, stemflow, litterfall and fine root decay. Element concentrations were tested for their relationship with litterflow amounts, rainfall intensity and length of the antecedent dry period and differences in element fluxes between ecosystems were assessed. Concentrations of elements in litterflow followed a similar pattern as those in throughfall, which indicates that element outputs from the forest floor are strongly related to those inputs in throughfall. In the forests studied, the average concentrations of elements as K, Mg, orthoP and the pH of the litterflow decreased relative to that in throughfall in most events, while the concentration of elements such as dissolved organic carbon, H, SO<sub>4</sub> and Si increased in litterflow from these forests. Element concentrations in litterflow showed a poor correlation with variables such as litterflow amounts, rainfall intensity and antecedent dry period, except for K which showed a significant correlation (p>0.95) with analysed variables in all forests. Outputs were significantly different between forests (p>0.95); these fluxes, which particularly concerned cations, being the largest in the flood plain, while for anions outputs increased from the flood plain to the sedimentary plain. After adding the nutrient contributed by litter decomposition and fine root decay, the net outputs of main elements from the forest floors were still smaller than inputs by net precipitation (throughfall + stemflow) indicating that the litter layers clearly acted as a sink for most nutrients. Accordingly, the element balances confirm that the forest floors acted as a sink for nutrients coming in by throughfall, stemflow, litterfall and fine root decomposition. P, Mg and N appeared to be the most limiting nutrients and the forests studied efficiently recycled these nutrients.
1469895|DyDOC describes soil carbon dynamics, with a focus on dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The model treats the soil as a three-horizon profile, and simulates metabolic carbon transformations, sorption reactions and water transport. Humic substances are partitioned into three fractions, one of which is immobile, while the other two (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) can pass into solution as DOC. DyDOC requires site-specific soil characteristics, and is driven by inputs of litter and water, and air and soil temperatures. The model operates on hourly and daily time steps, and can simulate carbon cycling over both long (hundreds-to-thousands of years) and short (daily) time scales. An important feature of DyDOC is the tracking of <sup>14</sup>C, from its entry in litter to its loss as DO <sup>14</sup>C in drainage water, enabling information about C dynamics to be obtained from both long-term radioactive decay, and the characteristic <sup>14</sup>C pulse caused by thermonuclear weapon testing during the 1960s ("bomb carbon"). Parameterisation is performed by assuming a current steady state. Values of a range of variables, including C pools, annual DOC fluxes, and <sup>14</sup>C signals, are combined into objective functions for least-squares minimisation. DyDOC has been applied successfully to spruce forest sites at Birkenes (Norway) and Waldstein (Germany), and most of the parameters have similar values at the two sites. The results indicate that the supply of DOC from the surface soil horizon to percolating water depends upon the continual metabolic production of easily leached humic material. In contrast, concentrations and fluxes of DOC in the deeper soil horizons are controlled by sorption processes, involving comparatively large pools of leachable organic matter. Times to reach steady state are calculated to be several hundred years in the organic layer, and hundreds-to-thousands of years in the deeper mineral layers. It is estimated that DOC supplies 89% of the mineral soil carbon at Birkenes, and 73% at Waldstein. The model, parameterised with "steady state" data, simulates short-term variations in DOC concentrations and fluxes, and in DO <sup>14</sup>C, which are in approximate agreement with observations.
1469248| Methane oxidation rates in the rhizosphere of Pontederia cordata, Sagittaria lancifolia, and Typha latifolia were quantified in field studies using the methyl fluoride inhibition technique. An average oxidation of 22.9  17.7% (sd, n = 44) was found for all field experiments (oxidation is expressed as a% of total potential emission in the presumed absence of oxidation). Greenhouse experiments using the same technique gave an average rhizospheric oxidation of 64.9  17.0% (sd, n = 44). Comparison of a subset of greenhouse plants with the methyl fluoride (MF) and a light oxic/dark anoxic (LO/DA) technique for suppressing CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation yielded similar percentages (57.7  15.0% for MF and 58.5  13.9% for LO/DA, n = 11). Rhizospheric oxidation displayed a seasonal trend in Typha latifolia with decreasing oxidation percentages during warmer months as the importance of rhizospheric CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation declined relative to CH<sub>4</sub> emission (46.5  13.8% in December and 13.5  1.7% in July). However, the absolute rate of methane oxidation was highest during the warmer months (44.2 3.4 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in December and 318.7 151.4 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in July). As methane emission rates increased, the sensitivity of the methyl fluoride technique decreased due to the larger error between replicate flux measurements. 
1469800| Seasonal monitoring of metal sulfides was carried out in four soils of the Ra de Ortigueira salt marshes. Soils from the high salt marsh (with suboxic redox conditions at the surface), had low concentrations of iron sulfides (AVS and pyrite fraction) and thus a low degree of trace metal pyritization (DTMP) in surface layers (0-10 cm), but concentrations of metals associated with the pyrite fraction increased considerably at depth (27.5 cm). In the low salt marsh soils (with anoxic conditions at the surface) maximum concentrations of metal sulfides were found in the surface layers of soils colonized by Spartina maritima. These results are explained by the double effect exerted by roots in strongly reduced soils. On the one hand, they stimulate the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria and on the other, they favour the partial oxidation of the soil, thus generating polysulfides with which Fe<sup>2+</sup> immediately precipitates as pyrite, whereas in the deepest, permanently anoxic layers, pyrite must be formed in a reaction in which FeS is an intermediate, as follows: FeS+H<sub>2</sub>S FeS<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>. Concentrations of metal sulfides also varied greatly with the season, with two patterns being distinguished. In soils colonized by S. maritima in both high and low salt marshes, the lowest concentrations were found in summer. At this time of the year there is a net loss of metal sulfides throughout the profile, presumably due to physiological activity of plants (evapotranspiration and release of oxygen from roots). In contrast, maximum concentrations of AVS and pyritic metals were found in the summer in the low salt marsh soils not colonized by vascular plants (creek bottom). In this case, the higher temperatures increased the activity of sulfur-reducing bacteria leading to synthesis and accumulation of metal sulfides in the soil. 
1468934|Sulfate reduction and pore water solutes related to sulfur cycling and anaerobic processes (short chain fatty acids (SCFA), SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, TCO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, dissolved sulfides ( H<sub>2</sub>S) and CH<sub>4</sub>) were examined during one year at a marine fish farm. Mineralization of fish farm waste products was rapid in this non-bioturbated, organic rich sediment. Stimulation of sulfate reduction rates (SRR) occurred primarily in the surface layers where the organic matter was deposited. Acetate was the most important (>99%) of the measured SCFA attaining high concentrations during summer months (up to 4.7 mM). The acetate profiles exhibited distinct seasonal cycles, where periods with high concentrations in the pore waters were found coincident with a high pool of particulate organic matter in the surface sediments and a low activity of the sulfate reducing bacteria (early spring and late summer). Periods with low acetate pools occurred when sulfate reduction rates were high in early summer and in winter were pools of particulate organic matter were decreasing. Methane production was observed concurrent with sulfate reduction in the microbial active surface layers in late summer. Subsurface peaks of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, TCO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and  H<sub>2</sub>S were evident in July and August due to rapid mineralization in these surface layers. With decreasing autumn water temperatures mineralization rates declined and subsurface peaks of these solutes disappeared. A strong relationship was found between pore water TCO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. Ratios between TCO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> were low compared to a control site, attaining minimum values in mid-summer. This indicated rapid nitrogen mineralization of nitrogen rich labile substrates in the fish farm sediment during the entire season.
20456391|N saturation induced by atmospheric N deposition can have serious consequences for forest health in many regions. In order to evaluate whether foliar N may be a robust, regional-scale measure of the onset of N saturation in forest ecosystems, we assembled a large dataset on atmospheric N deposition, foliar and root N and N concentration, soil C:N, mineralization and nitrification. The dataset included sites in northeastern North America, Colorado, Alaska, southern Chile and Europe. Local drivers of N cycling (net nitrification and mineralization, and forest floor and soil C:N) were more closely coupled with foliar N than the regional driver of N deposition. Foliar N increased non-linearly with nitrification:mineralization ratio and decreased with forest floor C:N. Foliar N was more strongly related to nitrification rates than was foliar N concentration, but concentration was more strongly correlated with N deposition. Root N was more tightly coupled to forest floor properties than was foliar N. We observed a pattern of decreasing foliar N values across the following species: American beech &gt; yellow birch &gt; sugar maple. Other factors that affected foliar N included species composition and climate. Relationships between foliar N and soil variables were stronger when analyzed on a species by species basis than when many species were lumped. European sites showed distinct patterns of lower foliar N, due to the importance of ammonium deposition in this region. Our results suggest that examining N values of foliage may improve understanding of how forests respond to the cascading effects of N deposition.
20055224|Biocycling of sulfur (S) has been proposed to play an important role in the recovery of ecosystems following anthropogenic S deposition. Here, we investigated the importance of the humus layer in the biocycling of S in three forested catchments in the Grdsjn area of southwestern Sweden with differing S inputs and S isotope signature values. These experimental sites consisted of two reference catchments and the Grdsjn roof experiment catchment (G1), where anthropogenic deposition was intercepted from 1991 until May 2002 by a roof placed over the entire catchment area. Under the roof, controlled levels of deposition were applied, using a sprinkler system, and the only form of S added was marine
20456513|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were determined over 3 years in headwater streams draining two adjacent catchments. The catchments are currently under different land use; pasture/grazing vs plantation forestry. The objectives of the work were to quantify C and nutrient export from these landuses and elucidate the factors regulating export. In both catchments, stream water dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations exhibited strong seasonal variations. Concentrations were highest during runoff events in late summer and autumn and rapidly declined as discharge increased during winter and spring. The annual variation of stream water N and P concentrations indicated that these nutrients accumulated in the catchments during dry summer periods and were flushed to the streams during autumn storm events. By contrast, stream water DOC concentrations did not exhibit seasonal variation. Higher DOC and NO concentrations were observed in the stream of the forest catchment, reflecting greater input and subsequent breakdown of leaf-litter in the forest catchment. Annual export of DOC was lower from the forested catchment due to the reduced discharge from this catchment. In contrast however, annual export of nitrate was higher from the forest catchment suggesting that there was an additional NO source or reduction of a NO sink. We hypothesize that the denitrification capacity of the forested catchment has been significantly reduced as a consequence of increased evapotranspiration and subsequent decrease in streamflow and associated reduction in the near stream saturated area.
1469377|In the Amazon floodplain large areas of unvegetated lake sediments are exposed to air during low water. I measured methane fluxes from exposed sediments of an Amazonian floodplain lake and assessed the regulating factors. Methane emission decreased from values between 10 and 40 mol CH4 m-2 h-1 to zero when the sediments were exposed to air. Mean fluxes were about 3.7 mol CH4 m-2 h-1. Fluxes were low compared to measurements taken from flooded habitats making exposed lake sediments a negligible source of atmospheric CH4. This was mainly due to the lack of ebullition which governs methane flux in the flooded phase. Methane oxidation at the sediment surface consumed up to 75% of the methane entering the oxidised zone. Compared with CO2 emission methane turnover was of minor importance for the carbon budget of the sediments.
20456577|During the last decades, decision makers and policy have increasingly demanded for regional and national inventories of greenhouse gas emission, such as nitrous oxide (NO), to develop appropriate strategies and mitigation options. A potential way to derive large-scale estimates of NO emission is the use of process-based models, such as PnET-N-DNDC or Wetland-DNDC. While PnET-N-DNDC has been effectively applied for various upland forest ecosystems, the Wetland-DNDC model has not yet been validated with regard to NO emission. We calibrated and validated the Wetland-DNDC model on the basis of a 4-year field data set of two water-logged soils (Humic Gleysol and Histic Gleysol) of a spruce forest ecosystem. Model calibration by means of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm considerably improved the model performance for the period of calibration (2001-2002). The error variance was reduced by up to a factor of two and the modelling efficiency was increased from -1.24 to -0.15 (Humic Gleysol) and from -0.42 to 0.1 (Histic Gleysol). However, the model performance for the period of validation (2003-2004) and particularly for the extreme dry period in summer 2003 was not fully satisfying, notably with regard to the temporal pattern of the NO emission.
1469691|To assess the fate of the large amounts of nitrogen (N) brought into the environment by human activities, we constructed N budgets for sixteen large watersheds (475 to 70,189 km<sup>2</sup>) in the northeastern U.S.A. These watersheds are mainly forested (48-87%), but vary widely with respect to land use and population density. We combined published data and empirical and process models to set up a complete N budget for these sixteen watersheds. Atmospheric deposition, fertilizer application, net feed and food inputs, biological fixation, river discharge, wood accumulation and export, changes in soil N, and denitrification losses in the landscape and in rivers were considered for the period 1988 to 1992. For the whole area, on average 3420 kg of N is imported annually per km<sup>2</sup> of land. Atmospheric N deposition, N<sub>2</sub> fixation by plants, and N imported in commercial products (fertilizers, food and feed) contributed to the input in roughly equal contributions. We quantified the fate of these inputs by independent estimates of storage and loss terms, except for denitrification from land, which was estimated from the difference between all inputs and all other storage and loss terms. Of the total storage and losses in the watersheds, about half of the N is lost in gaseous form (51%, largely by denitrification). Additional N is lost in riverine export (20%), in food exports (6%), and in wood exports (5%). Change in storage of N in the watersheds in soil organic matter (9%) and wood (9%) accounts for the remainder of the sinks. The presence of appreciable changes in total N storage on land, which we probably under-rather than overestimated, shows that the N budget is not in steady state, so that drainage and denitrification exports of N may well increase further in the future.
1469198|Using a recently developed in situ multiprobe the redox development in the water column of warm-monomictic Lake Kinneret was investigated during three annual cycles. During the time when sulfide release into the meta- and hypolimnion is initiated, our measurements show a linear relationship, close to the thermodynamic function, between the platinum electrode potential and the amount of sulfide produced by the sulfate reducing bacteria. A change of this relationship during summer stratification coincides with the bloom of the phototrophic sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeobacteroides.
20456503|To determine the sources and sinks of atmospherically deposited Pb at a forested watershed (Plastic Lake) in central Ontario, Canada, Pb pools and fluxes through upland, wetland and lake compartments were measured during 2002/2003 and compared with previous measurements taken between 1989 and 1991. In 2002/2003, annual bulk deposition of Pb was 0.49 mg m compared with 1.90-1.30 mg m in 1989-1991. Annual Pb concentrations in stream water draining the upland part of the catchment were very low (0.04 g l) and were approximately half those measured in 1989-1991 (0.11-0.08 g l). Leaching losses in stream water were small and mass balance estimates indicate almost complete retention (&gt;95%) of atmospherically deposited Pb in upland soils. In contrast, annual Pb concentrations in stream water draining a wetland were between 0.38 and 0.77 g l, with the highest concentration occurring in 2002/2003 and mass balance calculations indicate that the wetland is a net source of Pb in all measured years. Lead concentrations in the lake outflow were low and the average Pb concentration measured in 2002/2003 (0.09 g l) was approximately half the value recorded in 1989-1991 (0.19 g l both years). Annual mass balance estimates indicate that the lake retained between 2.47 mg m (1989/1990) and 1.42 mg m (2002/2003) and that in 2002/2003 68% of the Pb input to the lake is derived from the terrestrial catchment. These estimates are higher than sediment core records, which indicate around 18 mg m Pb was retained in sediment during the 1990s. Nevertheless, Pb concentrations decrease with sediment depth and Pb/Pb concentrations increase with depth, a pattern also observed in mineral soils that reflects the substantial contribution of anthropogenic Pb to the watershed. Lead isotope data from soil and sediment indicate a recent anthropogenic Pb signal (Pb/Pb  1.185) in upper soils and sediments and an older anthropogenic signal (Pb/Pb  1.20) in deeper soil and sediment. Lead isotope data in sediment and vegetation indicate that practically all the Pb cycled in the forest at Plastic Lake is anthropogenic in origin.
1468691| We performed a one-year study to determine the effects of on-site sewage disposal systems (OSDS, septic tanks) on the nutrient relations of limestone groundwaters and nearshore surface waters of the Florida Keys. Monitor wells were installed on canal residences with OSDS and a control site in the Key Deer National Wildlife Refuge on Big Pine Key. Groundwater and surface water samples were collected monthly during 1987 and analyzed for concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN=NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>+NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>+NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), temperature and salinity. Significant nutrient enrichment (up to 5000-fold) occurred in groundwaters contiguous to OSDS; DIN was enriched an average of 400-fold and SRP some 70-fold compared to control groundwaters. Ammonium was the dominant nitrogenous species and its concentration ranged from a low of 0.77 M in control wells to 2.75 mM in OSDS-enriched groundwaters. Concentrations of nitrate plus nitrite were also highly enriched and ranged from 0.05 M in control wells to 2.89 mM in enriched groundwaters. Relative to DIN, concentrations of SRP were low and ranged from 30 nM in control wells to 107 M in enriched groundwaters. N: P ratios of enriched groundwaters were consistently > 100 and increased with increasing distance from the OSDS, suggesting significant, but incomplete, adsorption of SRP by subsurface flow through carbonate substrata. Nutrient concentrations of groundwaters also varied seasonally and were approximately two-fold higher during the winter (DIN = 1035 M; SRP = 10.3 M) compared to summer (DIN = 470 M; SRP = 4.0 M). In contrast, surface water nutrient concentrations were two-fold higher during the summer (DIN = 5.0 M; SRP = 0.50 M) compared to winter (DIN = 2.5 M; SRP = 0.15 M). Direct measurement of subsurface groundwater flow rate indicated that tides and increased groundwater recharge enhanced flow some two-fold and six-fold, respectively. Accordingly, the observed seasonal coupling of OSDS-derived nutrients from groundwaters to surface waters is maximum during summer because of seasonally maximum tides and increased hydraulic head during the summer wet season. The yearly average benthic flux of anthropogenic DIN into contiguous canal surface waters is 55 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>, a value some five-fold greater than the highest rate of benthic N-fixation measured in carbonate-rich tropical marine waters. 
41490504|Cutins of plant shoots and suberins, mostly present in roots could contribute to significant portions of stable soil organic matter. Their biomarker potential, residing in their unique compositions in different plant types, has been used previously to infer sources of organic matter in sediments. These aliphatic plant biopolyesters contain specific biomarkers, which may be used for tracing their fate in soils and sediments, when combined with stable C isotope labelling. In order to evaluate the potential use of cutin and suberin biomarkers as indicators of shoot and root contributions from C and C plant origins, the objectives of this study were to 1) identify their constitutive monomers, which are specific for shoots and roots of maize (C) and wheat (C); 2) evaluate the C differences between maize and wheat biomarkers. Mid-chain hydroxy carboxylic acids were mainly found in the aboveground biomass, while ,-alkanedioic acids were only present in the roots. The differences in the isotopic composition of the specific monomers between wheat and maize plants (1718% o for shoot markers, 19 for root markers) were larger than those observed for bulk plant tissues and close to those observed for ligninderived phenols in other studies. These differences should make it possible to differentiate and quantify the different types and sources of organic matter in sediments and soils. In particular, the molecular and isotopic signatures of cutins and suberins can be used to evaluate the specific dynamics of root vs shoot tissues in soils using C/C chronosequences.
41410606|Rice field outflow can contain high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which plays a crucial role in drinking water quality and aquatic ecosystem processes. This study examined the relationship between potential determining factors (i.e. rice area, outflow, drainwater reuse, soil properties, and time, measured as the day in the growing season) and the concentration and composition of DOC exported from 11 rice-dominated subwatersheds. Samples were collected from subwatershed inflow and outflow every 1-2 weeks from May through September 2008 and analyzed for DOC concentration, trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), and also specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and the spectral slope parameter (S), which are indicators of DOC composition. Concentrations of DOC across all subwatersheds and sampling dates ranged from 1.56 to 14.43 mg L (mean = 4.32 mg L). Linear mixed effects (LME) analysis indicated that DOC concentration decreased over time, and that THMFP, and DOC and THM flux, decreased over time, but increased with outflow. LME analysis of the SUVA and S parameters indicated that the fraction of aromatic DOC moieties increased with time, outflow, and reuse. Additionally, apparent peaks in DOC concentrations, THMFP, and SUVA coincided with the onsets of flooding and draining. Lastly, subwatersheds with outflow less than approximately 4,700 m ha behaved as sinks of DOC. Our findings suggest that water management factors such as outflow, reuse, and discrete irrigation events, all of which vary over the course of the growing season, were the dominant determinants of DOC concentration and composition.
1469408|The fluxes of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere, and the relative contributions of ebullition and molecular diffusion, were determined for a small hypertrophic freshwater lake (Priest Pot, U.K.) over the period May to October 1997. The average total flux of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> (estimated from 7 sites on the lake) was approximately 52 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> and was apportioned 12 and 40 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> to CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> respectively. Diffusion across the air-water interface accounted for the loss of 0.4 and 40 mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> respectively whilst the corresponding figures for ebullition losses were 12.0 (CH<sub>4</sub>) and 0.23 (CO<sub>2</sub>) mmol m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>. Most CH<sub>4</sub> (96%) was lost by ebullition, and most CO<sub>2</sub> (99%) by diffusive processes. The ebullition of gas, measured at weekly intervals along a transect of the lake, showed high spatial and temporal variation. The CH<sub>4</sub> content of the trapped gas varied between 44 and 88% (by volume) and was highest at the deepest points. Pulses of gas ebullition were detected during periods of rapidly falling barometric pressure. The relevance of the measurements to global estimates of carbon emission from freshwaters are discussed.
24715323|Carbon dynamics during litter decomposition have been described in a variety of forest ecosystems and provided insights into carbon flow in soils. To quantitatively assess how decomposition processes vary between litter types, solid-state C cross-polarization and magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS NMR) technique was applied to analyze conifer (cedar, cypress) and hardwood (chinquapin, beech, oak, birch) litter which had degraded during a 3 year litterbag experiment throughout Japan. The results were used to identify compositional changes and estimate decomposition constants (k values) in exponential equations. Total litter and carbon type mass losses during decomposition varied significantly between litter types, being affected by the initial physicochemical litter quality. Concomitant increases and decreases in carbonyl and O/N-alkyl C compositions, respectively, were observed for all litter types, but aromatic and aliphatic C dynamics were less consistent. In hardwoods, [aromatic/aliphatic C ratio] was generally stable during decomposition, suggesting that, in hardwoods, the decomposabilities of aromatic and aliphatic C were similar. In the conifers, an increasing [aromatic/aliphatic C ratio] during decomposition suggested that aromatic C was more recalcitrant than aliphatic C. These results suggest that different decomposition processes between litter types might be related to different aromatic and aliphatic C behaviors, as affected by lignin stability and lipid leachability and biosynthesis. Variations in the k values for total litter and carbon types were not obvious between litter types, although the mass loss patterns differed significantly. The k values estimated in this study may contribute to predictions of soil carbon dynamics and the validation of carbon compartment models in forest ecosystems.
1469840| Annual nitrogen and phosphorus budgets for the whole North Sea taking into account the most recent data available were established. The area considered has a total surface of approximately 700,000 km<sup>2</sup> and corresponds to the definition by OSPARCOM (Oslo and Paris Commission) with the exclusion of the Skagerrak and Kattegat areas. Input and output fluxes were determined at the marine, atmospheric, sediment and continental boundaries, and riverine inputs based on river flows and nutrient concentrations at the river-estuary interface were corrected for possible estuarine retention. The results showed that the North Sea is an extremely complex system subjected to large inter-annual variability of marine water circulation and freshwater land run-off. Consequently, resulting total N (TN) and P (TP) fluxes are extremely variable from 1 year to another and this has an important influence on the budget of these elements. Total inputs to the North Sea are 8870 4860 kT N year<sup>-1</sup> and 494 279 kT P year<sup>-1</sup>. Denitrification is responsible for the loss of 23  7% of the TN inputs while sediment burial is responsible for the retention of only of 2  2% of the TP input. For TN, due to the large variability on marine and estuarine fluxes, and to the uncertainty related to the denitrification rate, it was concluded that the North Sea could either be a source (1930 kT N year<sup>-1</sup>) or a sink (1700 kT N year<sup>-1</sup>) for the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. For TP it was concluded that the North Sea is mostly a source (-4 to 52 kT P year<sup>-1</sup>) for the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. 
41490547|Climate models project that precipitation patterns will likely intensify in the future, resulting in increased duration of droughts and increased frequency of large soil rewetting events, which are stressful to the microorganisms that drive soil biogeochemical cycling. Historical conditions can affect contemporary microbial responses to environmental factors through the persistence of abiotic changes or through the selection of a more tolerant microbial community. We examined how a history of intensified rainfall would alter microbial functional response to drying and rewetting events, whether this historical legacy was mediated through altered microbial community composition, and how long community and functional legacies persisted under similar conditions. We collected soils from a long-term field manipulation (Rainfall Manipulation Plot Study) in Kansas, USA, where rainfall variability was experimentally amplified. We measured respiration, microbial biomass, fungal:bacterial ratios and bacterial community composition after collecting soils from the field experiment, and after subjecting them to a series of dryingrewetting pulses in the lab. Although rainfall history affected respiration and microbial biomass, the differences between field treatments did not persist throughout our 115-day dryingrewetting incubation. However, soils accustomed to more extreme rainfall did change less in response to lab moisture pulses. In contrast, bacterial community composition did not differ between rainfall manipulation treatments, but became more dissimilar in response to dryingrewetting puls es depending on their previous field conditions. Our results suggest that environmental history can affect contemporary rates of biogeochemical processes both through changes in abiotic drivers and through changes in microbial community structure. However, the extremity of the disturbance and the mechanism through which historical legacies occur may influence how long they persist, which determines the importance of these effects for biogeochemical cycling.
41490490|The Cerrado is the second largest Brazilian biome and contains the headwaters of three major hydrological basins in Brazil. In spite of the biological and ecological relevance of this biome, there is little information about how land use changes affect the chemistry of low-order streams in the Cerrado. To evaluate these effects streams that drain areas under natural, rural, and urban land cover were sampled near Braslia, Brazil. Water samples were collected between September 2004 and December 2006. Chemical concentrations generally followed the pattern of Urban > Rural > Natural. Median conductivity of stream water of 21.6 (interquartile: 22.7) S/cm in urban streams was three and five-fold greater relative to rural and natural areas, respectively. In the wet season, despite of increasing discharge, concentration of many solutes were higher, particularly in rural and natural streams. Streams also presented higher total dissolved N (TDN) loads from natural to rural and urban although DIN:DON ratios did not differ significantly.In natural and urban streams TDN was 80 and 77% dissolved organic N, respectively. These results indicate that alterations in land cover from natural to rural and urban are changing stream water chemistry in the Cerrado with increasing solute concentrations, in addition to increased TDN output in areas under urban cover, with potential effects on ecosystem function.
20456481|Phaeocystis spp. cell and colony mass fluxes and their contribution to the vertical particulate organic carbon (POC) export from a wide range of stations were quantified by shortterm sediment traps. The compilation of available data, ranging from polar to sub-arctic and boreal regions, revealed that Phaeocystis colonial and single cells frequently are observed in shallow sediment traps at 30-50 m depth (average of 7  11% of POC export). A strong vertical export decline between 40 m and 100 m diminished the contribution of Phaeocystis spp. cell carbon to vertical export of POC to only 3  2% at 100 m depth, with two exceptions (deeper mixed stations). Estimates of potential corresponding mucus contribution increased the average Phaeocystis spp. contribution to &lt;5% of POC export. The vertical flux attenuation efficiency is higher for Phaeocystis spp. than for diatoms. The overall contribution of Phaeocystis spp. to vertical carbon export based on direct investigations of vertical organic carbon export is small.
40343567|Plant species effects on soil nutrient availability are relatively well documented, but the effects of species differences in litter chemistry on soil carbon cycling are less well understood, especially in the species-rich tropics. In many wet tropical forest ecosystems, leaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the litter layer accounts for a significant proportion of litter mass loss during decomposition. Here we investigated how tree species differences in soluble dissolved organic C (DOC) and nutrients affected soil CO fluxes in laboratory incubations. We leached DOM from freshly fallen litter of six canopy tree species collected from a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica and measured C-mineralization. We found significant differences in litter solubility and nutrient availability. Following DOM additions to soil, rates of heterotrophic respiration varied by as much as an order of magnitude between species, and overall differences in total soil CO efflux varied by more than four-fold. Variation in the carbon: phosphorus ratio accounted for 51% of the variation in total CO flux between species. These results suggest that tropical tree species composition may influence soil C storage and mineralization via inter-specific variation in plant litter chemistry.
20519857|In most ecosystems, the degradation of complex organic material depends on extracellular enzymes produced by microbes. These enzymes can exist in bound or free form within the soil, but the dynamics of these different enzyme pools remain uncertain. To address this uncertainty, I determined rates of enzyme turnover in a volcanic soil with and without added enzymes. I also tested whether or not soil minerals and humic acids would alter enzyme activity. In soils that were gamma-irradiated to stop enzyme production, 35-70% of the enzyme activity was stable throughout the 21-day incubation. The remaining enzyme fraction decayed at rates ranging from - 0.032 to - 0.628 day. In both the irradiated soils and in soils with added enzymes, addition of the mineral allophane had a strong positive effect on most enzyme activities. Another added mineral, ferrihydrite, had a weak positive effect on some enzymes. Added humic acids strongly inhibited enzyme activity. These findings suggest that minerals, especially allophane, enhance potential enzyme activities in young volcanic soils. However, the actual activity and function of these enzymes may be low under field conditions if stabilization results in less efficient enzyme-substrate interactions. If this is the case, then much of the measured enzyme activity in bulk soil may be stabilized but unlikely to contribute greatly to ecosystem processes.
1469727| The source of particulate organic matter at the PN section in the East China Sea has been evaluated using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. The results showed that the  <sup>13</sup>C and  <sup>15</sup>N compositions varied from -19 to -31 and 0.7-9.5 respectively, and the isotope compositions were statistically distinct, enabling, by use of a simple components mixing equations, assessment of the ability of each tracer to estimate the terrestrial, Kuroshio Water, marine and remineralized sources' contributions. The dominance of terrestrial inputs of the Changjiang could be observed 250 km far from the river mouth in the East China Sea. In the shelf water column, the remineralization of biogenic organic matter becomes an important source except for the terrigenous and marine sources. The estimation of sources recorded by  <sup>13</sup>C data was partly confirmed by equivalent  <sup>15</sup>N and C/N compositions that reflected greater control by organic matter diagenesis and biological processing. However, the lighter contribution of  <sup>13</sup>C data of the Kuroshio samples also indicates the alteration of the isotope values by microbial or other processes. The net export flux of POC in the PN section is estimated to be 4.1 kmol C/s and the annual export is 129 Gmol C/yr, which is account for 20% of the East China Sea. 
1468605|Watershed processes influence the acid neutralizing capacity of surface waters by mediating changes in concentration of ionic solutes. Acidification of surface waters by atmospheric deposition of mineral acids and the extent to which ecosystem transformations neutralize this acidity are of particular concern. Seasonal variations in flow paths of water through soil and biological processes result in short-term changes in chemistry that may be critical to surface water ecology. In this study, we assessed longitudinal and temporal variations in the chemistry of a low-order stream, Pancake-Hall Creek, located in the west-central Adirondack region of New York. By quantifying changes in ionic solute concentration (e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>n+</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) we were able to evaluate processes responsible for short-term fluctuations in acid/base chemistry. In the headwater sites, stream water was acidic; changes in pH, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and Al were primarily due to seasonal variations in basic cation and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations. At the downstream sites, water migrated through a large beaver impoundment and thick till resulting in higher pH, acid neutralizing capacity and basic cation concentrations, and lower concentrations of Al. Neutralization of acidity was particularly evident during the low flow summer period and coincided with retention of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> in the beaver impoundment. During the high flow non-summer (October to June) period, depressed pH and ANC, and elevated Al concentrations were observed in the downstream sites. Acidic conditions during the non-summer period were not due to the oxidation of reduced sulfur deposits (e.g. SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> events) but rather the resumption of conservative SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> transport through the beaver impoundment (e.g. minimal SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> retention) coupled with increases in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.
1469418| The potentials for sequential reduction of inorganic electron acceptors and production of methane have been examined in sixteen rice soils obtained from China, the Philippines, and Italy. Methane, CO<sub>2</sub>, Fe(II), NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>,SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, pH, E<sub>h</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> and acetate were monitored during anaerobic incubation at 30 C for 120 days. Based on the accumulation patterns of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, the reduction process was divided into three distinct phases: (1) an initial reduction phase during which most of the inorganic electron acceptors were depleted and CO<sub>2</sub> production was at its maximum, (2) a methanogenic phase during which CH<sub>4</sub> production was initiated and reached its highest rate, and (3) a steady state phase with constant production rates of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. The reduction phases lasted for 19 to 75 days with maximum CO<sub>2</sub> production of 2.3 to 10.9 mol d<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> dry soil. Methane production started after 2 to 87 days and became constant after about 38-68 days (one soil > 120 days). The maximum CH<sub>4</sub> production rates ranged between 0.01 and 3.08 mol d<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. During steady state the constant CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> production rates varied from 0.07 to 0.30 mol d<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 0.02 and 0.28 mol d<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Within the 120 d of anaerobic incubation only 6-17% of the total soil organic carbon was released into the gas phase. The gaseous carbon released consisted of 61-100% CO<sub>2</sub>, <0.1-35% CH<sub>4</sub>, and <5% nonmethane hydrocarbons. Associated with the reduction of available Fe(III) most of the CO<sub>2</sub> was produced during the reduction phase. The electron transfer was balanced between total CO<sub>2</sub> produced and both CH<sub>4</sub> formed and Fe(III), sulfate and nitrate reduced. Maximum CH<sub>4</sub> production rate (r = 0.891) and total CH<sub>4</sub> produced (r = 0.775) correlated best with the ratio of soil nitrogen to electron acceptors. Total nitrogen content was a better indicator for "available" organic substrates than the total organic carbon content. The redox potential was not a good predictor of potential CH<sub>4</sub> production. These observations indicate that the availability of degradable organic substrates mainly controls the CH<sub>4</sub> production in the absence of inorganic electron acceptors. 
20456538|We examined the effect of sustained stream bank seepage during base flow conditions on the pore water nitrogen biogeochemistry of two riparian zones in lowland agricultural areas in southern Ontario, Canada. Nitrate, ammonium and dissolved oxygen concentrations in riparian subsurface water over a two-year period showed well-organized spatial patterns along stream bank seepage flow paths that extended seasonally up to 25 m inland. High levels of dissolved oxygen and
20055229|The Pawcatuck river watershed (797 km) is located in southern Rhode Island and northeastern Connecticut. The predominant lithology of the area is granite, and over 60% of the watershed remains forested with mixed hardwoods (primarily oak) and eastern white pine. As part of a larger study of nutrient and sediment exports from the watershed to Little Narragansett Bay, we measured dissolved silica (SiO) (DSi) concentrations at the river mouth over 70 times between January 14, 2002 and November 29, 2002. Annual export of DSi during our study was 40  10 mol or 50 kmol km. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) obtained DSi concentrations at this site, at varying frequencies, from 1978 to the present, which allowed for a historical comparison of this study with previous years. River DSi concentrations exhibited a strong seasonal signal that did not vary in a regular way with water discharge or water temperature. DSi and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations were significantly related over the annual cycle (p &lt 0.0001) and both decreased substantially during the spring. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) did not covary at any time with silica or nitrogen, suggesting that in-stream biological uptake was not responsible for the seasonal decline in silica. The spring decline in river silica concentrations may be due to silica uptake by terrestrial vegetation. We estimate a net forest silica accretion rate of 41 kmol
1468768| Sulfate reduction occurred from 0-3 cm below the surface of the epilimnetic sediments of three northwestern Ontario lakes, including L.223, which has been experimentally acidified by additions of sulfuric acid. Shallow water sites were conducive to SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction because decomposition in these predominantly sandy sediments caused oxygen concentrations to decrease rapidly within mm below the interface. The occurrence of methanogenesis just below the depth of minimum SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration demonstrated that availability of organic carbon was not a limiting factor for sulphate reduction. Laboratory studies showed that SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> reduction rates in mixed sediments were lower at pH 4 than at pH 6. However, sulfate gradients in sediments indicated that there was no effect of acidification on sulfate reduction in situ. This was probably because microbial H<sup>+</sup> consumption in the epilimnetic sediments maintained steep pH gradients below the sediment-water interface. The pH increased from  5.0 to 6.5 or higher by a depth of 3.0 cm into the sediments. 
20519811|Changes in the total phenolics, condensed tannins (CT), protein-precipitable phenolics content and protein precipitation capacity were determined on a series of mangrove leaves from two true viviparous mangrove species (Kandelia candel and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza) at various stages of development and decomposition in the Jiulong River Estuary, Fujian, China. Similar measurements were also done for the propagules at different developmental stages. The results showed that the total phenolics, extractable condensed tannins, total condensed tannins, protein-precipitable phenolics content and protein precipitation capacity in young leaves were higher than those in mature and senescent leaves. Tannin dynamics during leaf decomposition varied with species, and the rapid loss of phenolics observed during decomposition can be ascribed to leaching and degradation. Protein-bound CT and fibre-bound CT tended to increase with leaf decomposition, with CT binding more strongly to protein than to fibre. Protein-bound CT was higher than fibre-bound CT with the exception of mature leaves. Total phenolics, extractable CT and protein-precipitable phenolics contents in flower tissues were relatively lower than those in hypocotyls at different developmental stages. Protein precipitation capacity fluctuated with the development of propagules. Increases in nitrogen in decaying litter, and declines in contents of total phenolics and total condensed tannins of detritus support the general conclusion that decomposing mangrove detritus can be a more palatable heterotrophic substrate than living leaves.
24715343|We compared the properties of the clay mineral fraction and the composition of soil solutions in a Fagus sylvatica coppice (native forest) and four adjacent plantations of Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus nigra, Picea abies and Quercus sessiliflora planted in 1976. The results revealed changes of clay fraction properties due to tree species effect. Clay samples from Douglas fir and pine stands differ when compared to other species. Twenty-eight years after planting, we observed the following changes: a more pronounced swelling after citrate extraction and ethylene glycol solvation, a higher CEC and a smaller poorly crystallised aluminium content. All these changes affecting the clay fraction agreed well with soil solution analyses which revealed high NO, H and Al concentrations under Douglas fir and pine. These changes were explained by a strong net nitrification under Douglas fir and pine stands when compared with other tree species. The higher NO concentrations in soil solutions should be linked to the presence, type and activity of ammonia-oxiding bacteria which are likely influenced by tree species. The production of NO in excess of biological demand leads to a net production of hydrogen ion and enhances the dissolution of poorly crystallised Al-minerals. Secondary Al-bearing minerals constituted the principal acid-consuming system in these soils. As a consequence, the depletion of interlayer spaces of hydroxyinterlayered minerals increases the number of sites for exchangeable cation fixation and increases CEC of the clay fraction. The dissolution of Al oxyhydroxides explain the increase in Al concentrations of soil solutions under Douglas fir and pine stands when compared to other species. Nitrate and dissolved aluminium were conjointly leached in the soil solutions. A change in environmental conditions, like an introduction of tree species, enough modifies soil processes to induce significant changes in the soil mineralogical composition even over a period of time as short as some tens of years. Generally, mineral weathering has been considered to be very slow and unlikely to change over tens of years, resulting in few studies capable of detecting changes in mineralogy. This study appears to have detected changes in clay mineralogy during a period of 28 years after the planting of forest species. Our study represents a single location with a limited block design, but causes us to conclude that the observed changes could be widely representative. Where available, archived samples should be utilized and long-term experiments set up so that similar changes can be tested for and detected using more robust designs. The plausible hypothesis we present to explain apparent changes in clay mineralogy has strong relevance to the sustainable management of land.
1469503|One important assumption in applying <sup>210</sup>Pb-dating is that atmospherically deposited <sup>210</sup>Pb is immobilized in the peat or sediment column. This assumption has been challenged widely, but has never been evaluated experimentally. We evaluated Pb mobility and the chemical forms in which Pb is stabilized in peat profiles by adding either soluble or particulate Pb to intact peat cores that were maintained under different water level regimes (permanently high, permanently low, fluctuating between high and low) and were subjected to simulated precipitation over a five month period. By analyzing the behavior of stable Pb we made inferences about the expected behavior of <sup>210</sup>Pb. Results indicate that added soluble Pb<sup>2+</sup> was retained in the peat through physiochemical binding to organic matter, and as such Pb<sup>2+</sup> was largely immobile in peat even under conditions of a fluctuating water table. Added particulate Pb was largely (most likely by physical entrapment), but not completely, immobilized in peat. In none of the water table treatments was there evidence to support mobility of Pb by alternating formation and oxidation of sulfides, or by any other mechanism. The binding of Pb<sup>2+</sup> with organic matter at the peat surface, and the absence of Pb mobility lend credence to <sup>210</sup>Pb-dating of Sphagnum-dominated peat deposits, which are over 90% organic matter throughout, and have high cation exchange capacities.
1469793|Lakes in Taylor Valley, southern Victoria Land, Antarctica, are unusual in that they are perennially covered by a 3-5 m thick ice layer. Previous work on gas concentrations in these lakes has shown that the surface waters are supersaturated with respect to O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, as well as the noble gases. Our data show that the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> (CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>) concentrations, calculated from pH and  CO<sub>2</sub>, can be highly undersaturated at shallow depths of the lakes. CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure values (pCO<sub>2</sub>) are as low as 10<sup>-4.3</sup> atm and 10<sup>-4.2</sup> atm in the east and west lobes of Lake Bonney, respectively, and 10<sup>-3.8</sup> atm in Lake Hoare. CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> depletion occurred only in the uppermost part of the water column, in association with elevated primary productivity (PPR). The upward diffusion of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> from the aphotic zone, and the annual input of CO<sub>2</sub> via glacial meltwater can not replenish the amount of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> annually lost to primary productivity in the uppermost meters of the water column. Calcification is a limited source of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub>, since the lakes are undersaturated with respect to calcite through portions of the austral summer. Preliminary respiration rates have been used to obtain an annual inorganic carbon balance. Further down in the water column, at the sites of the deep-water maximum in primary production (PPR<sub>max</sub>), which in Lakes Bonney and Fryxell is associated with nutrient gradients, CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> is not undersaturated. A large upward flux from CO<sub>2</sub>-supersaturated aphotic waters provides a surplus of CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> at the PPR<sub>max</sub>. Lake Fryxell, unlike the other lakes, is supersaturated with CO<sub>2(aq)</sub> throughout the entire water column.
20519893|Much of the research on the chemistry of snow and surface waters of the western US, Europe, and Asia has been conducted in high-elevation catchments above treeline. Here we provide information on the solute content of the seasonal snowpack at the Soddie site on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, a subalpine site near treeline. We focus on the storage and release of both inorganic and organic solutes to the soils underneath the snowpack, and subsequent effects on the chemical and nutrient content of the underlying soil solution and the adjacent headwater stream. The concentration of inorganic nitrogen (N) stored in the seasonal snowpack at the Soddie site of about 11 eq L was on the upper end of values reported for the northern hemisphere when compared to most areas of the Alps, Himalayas, and Tien Shan mountain ranges, but consistent with other reports of snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains. The storage of inorganic N in the snowpack at maximum accumulation averaged about 17 meq m, or 170 eq ha (on the order of 2 kg-N ha). Solutes were released from storage in the form of an ionic pulse, with a maximum concentration factor of about four. In contrast to the seasonal snowpack, the dominant form of N in the soil solution was dissolved organic N. Thus, soils underlying the seasonal snowpack appear to assimilate inorganic N released from storage in the snowpack and convert it to organic N. A two component mixing model suggests that the majority of streamflow was this year's snowmelt that had infiltrated the subsurface and undergone subsequent biological and geochemical reactions. The inorganic N in surface waters at the headwaters of Como creek were always near or below detection limits, suggesting that this area at treeline is still N-limited.
1469771| We used the hydrochemical model GWLF to estimate terrestrial diffuse fluxes from ungauged areas of a coastal plain catchment, the Choptank River basin. The gauged area of the basin is 17% of the land surface, and we divided the remaining ungauged area into 21 sub-basins. Three comparative approaches were used: (1) application of area yield coefficients based on 11 years of observations from the gauged area to extrapolate over ungauged sub-basins without modeling, (2) application of GWLF to estimate export from all sub-basins using model parameters calibrated in the gauged sub-basin, and (3) application of GWLF with parameter adjustments based on the local characteristics in each sub-basin. Comparison of the predicted export from 6 selected sub-basins with observed export data showed that application of GWLF with local adjustments reduced model errors of N export from 43% to 27%. With only one adjustment for sediment P, application of GWLF alone reduced errors of P export from 92% to 40-45%, with or without local adjustments for flow and sediment retention. The data supported the hypothesis that significant spatial variations in N and P yields introduce large errors when extrapolating from gauged to ungauged sub-basins, and estimated TN and TP yield coefficients varied over 1-21 kg N and 0.1-0.5 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> in ungauged areas due to varying human population densities, soil drainage characteristics, and amounts of agriculture. The most accurate estimates of terrestrial diffuse sources were combined with point source discharges and wet atmospheric inputs to estimate annual average inputs of 2.5  10<sup>6</sup> kg N and 5.8  10<sup>4</sup> kg P y<sup>-1</sup> to the Choptank estuary during 1980-1996. These results illustrate the problems of spatial extrapolation from gauged to ungauged areas and emphasize the need for application of local characteristics for accurate assessment of watershed export. 
1468860|The dissolved humic substances of seven Venezuelan blackwater rivers, belonging to different tropical biogeographical regions, were analyzed. Fractionation using Sephadex gel together with an analysis of their fluorescence, absorbance and infrared spectral properties, showed differences between their humic substances. These differences were related to their biological sources and humification environment. Statistical analysis of the properties of these humic substances allowed us to separate the rivers into three groups. These groups were directly related to the geological features and vegetation of the terrestrial ecosystems into which they drain: - The Autana, Atabapo, Chola, Negro which belong to the Amazon basin on the Guayana Shield, each with typical blackwater riverine forest. - The Caroni, belonging to the Orinoco basin on the Guayana Shield and with tropical humid forest and rainforest. - The Morichal Largo which draines the Mesa Formation from the eastern Llanos and has gallery forest of Mauritia flexuosa.
1469688| The feasibility of using nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) for elucidating sources and transformations of riverine nitrate was evaluated in a comparative study of 16 watersheds in the northeastern U.S.A. Stream water was sampled repeatedly at the outlets of the watersheds between January and December 1999 for determining concentrations,  <sup>15</sup>N values, and  <sup>18</sup>O values of riverine nitrate. In conjunction with information about land use and nitrogen fluxes,  <sup>15</sup>N<sub>nitrate</sub> and  <sup>18</sup>O<sub>nitrate</sub> values provided mainly information about sources of riverine nitrate. In predominantly forested watersheds, riverine nitrate had mean concentrations of less than 0.4 mg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N L<sup>-1</sup>,  <sup>15</sup>N<sub>nitrate</sub> values of less than +5, and  <sup>18</sup>O<sub>nitrate</sub> values between +12 and +19. This indicates that riverine nitrate was almost exclusively derived from soil nitrification processes with potentially minor nitrate contributions from atmospheric deposition in some catchments. In watersheds with significant agricultural and urban land use, concentrations of riverine nitrate were as high as 2.6 mg NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N L<sup>-1</sup> with  <sup>15</sup>N<sub>nitrate</sub> values between +5 and +8 and  <sup>18</sup>O<sub>nitrate</sub> values generally below +15. Correlations between nitrate concentrations,  <sup>15</sup>N<sub>nitrate</sub> values, and N fluxes suggest that nitrate in waste water constituted a major, and nitrate in manure a minor additional source of riverine nitrate. Atmospheric nitrate deposition or nitrate-containing fertilizers were not a significant source of riverine nitrate in watersheds with significant agricultural and urban land use. Although complementary studies indicate that in-stream denitrification was significant in all rivers, the isotopic composition of riverine nitrate sampled at the outlet of the 16 watersheds did not provide evidence for denitrification in the form of elevated  <sup>15</sup>N<sub>nitrate</sub> and  <sup>18</sup>O<sub>nitrate</sub> values. Relatively low isotopic enrichment factors for nitrogen and oxygen during in-stream denitrification and continuous admixture of nitrate from the above-described sources are thought to be responsible for this finding. 
1469063|The flux of a trace gas between soil and atmosphere is usually the result of simultaneously operating production and consumption processes. The compensation concentration is the concentration at which the rate of production equals the rate of consumption so that the net flux between soil and atmosphere is zero. Production and uptake may be due to different processes, which are at least partially known for some of the trace gases, and which may be differently regulated. The direction and the magnitude of the flux between soil and atmosphere is a function of both the compensation concentration and the trace gas concentration in the ambient atmosphere. Compensation and/or ambient concentrations may fluctuate and thus may have a strong impact on the flux of CO, NO and NO<sub>2</sub>, and to a smaller extent also on that of H<sub>2</sub>. Compensation concentrations also exist for N<sub>2</sub>O and OCS, but are too high to affect the flux under field conditions. Compensation concentrations have so far not been demonstrated for the flux of CH<sub>4</sub>. However, the uptake of CH<sub>4</sub> by soil exhibits a threshold concentration below which no uptake occurs.
1468614|Short interval sampling of precipitation inputs and stemflow-throughfall (SF-TF) outputs was conducted in a subalpine balsam fir forest to analyze the controls on canopy ion flux. A canopy hydrology model was used to separate the effects of abiotic and biotic processes. The time lag between precipitation inputs and SF-TF outputs caused by the storage of water in the canopy required that time-course patterns of SF-TF flux be examined graphically. The resulting trajectory analyses disclosed patterns from which we generalized about canopy processing of precipitation inputs. Changes in the ion concentration gradient across canopy tissue surfaces appeared to be an important factor in regulating the rate of flux of ions between canopy tissues and SF-TF. These changes were in turn determined by changes in such factors as apoplast ion concentrations and the residence time of water in the canopy. These generalizations permit qualitative predictions of SF-TF flux in other canopies over time based on only rudimentary knowledge of canopy structure and function.
20456457|An experiment was designed to further the empirical understanding of the effects of scale on fluxes of water and dissolved nitrogen from hillslopes in semi-arid shrubland. It was hypothesised that the behaviour of dissolved nitrogen is related to the scale of the contributing hillslope/catchment area and dynamics of the overland flow as has been demonstrated to be the case for soil erosion (Parsons et al. 2006). Data from four hillslope scales (ca. 21-300 m) and one subcatchment (ca. 1,500 m), collected over two monsoon seasons, support this hypothesis and demonstrate that the key controls of average dissolved nitrogen yields are flow discharge and plot scale. The slope of the best-fit line describing the relationship between flow discharge and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) yields descreases with increasing scale, from 0.0183 at 21.01 m, 0.0092 at 56.84 m, 0.0059 at 115.94 m, 0.0024 at 302.19 m to 0.0004 at 1,500 m. An implication of these findings is that care must be taken when upscaling results describing nutrient behaviour from small, plot experiments, as this behaviour appears to be scale dependent. For example, average yields of TDN in overland flow increase to a maximum with increasing plot area until an area of 50 m is reached, and decline with increasing plot size thereafter. Thus, studies that rely upon fixed plot scales may misrepresent catchment- or landscape-scale fluxes as they do not describe the changing relationship between overland flow and nutrient fluxes with increasing spatial scale. Further investigations into intra-event behaviour illustrate that nitrogen losses from natural rainfall/runoff events are supply limited as over the course of the events monitored, decreasing concentrations illustrate a pattern of nutrient exhaustion. When events are compared at the same sites through the monsoon season, however, the anticipated seasonal exhaustion effect is not present. This work provides an empirical basis to upscale the understanding of dissolved nitrogen behaviour from small hillslope plots to catchment scales in degraded semi-arid environments.
1469856| Atmospheric N deposition can enhance biological P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems and increase the importance of organic P to plants and microorganisms. We used NaOH-EDTA extraction and solution <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy to determine the P composition of soils in the Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve, northern England, an upland region influenced by such deposition for at least 150 years. Three characteristic soil types were sampled on three occasions during an annual cycle: blanket peat (318 g<sup>-1</sup> total C, 607 g g<sup>-1</sup> total P, pH 3.9); acid organic soil under grassland (354 mg g<sup>-1</sup> total C, 1190 g g<sup>-1</sup> total P, pH 3.7); calcareous soil under grassland (140 mg g<sup>-1</sup> total C, 649 g g<sup>-1</sup> total P, pH 7.3). Between 58 and 99% of the total P in soil and litter layers was extracted by 0.25 M NaOH + 0.05 M EDTA. Extracts of all soils were dominated by organic P, mainly in the form of orthophosphate monoesters (43-69% extracted P). The two acidic soils also contained large proportions of orthophosphate diesters (6-19% extracted P) and phosphonates (7-16% extracted P), suggesting that these compounds become stabilised at low pH. However, a seasonal trend of increasing orthophosphate monoester-to-diester ratios, most evident in the calcareous grassland soil, indicated the preferential degradation of orthophosphate diesters during the growing season. Orthophosphate was the major inorganic P compound (17-34% extracted P), and all soils contained pyrophosphate (1-5% extracted P). However, orthophosphate determined in the NaOH-EDTA extracts by solution <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy was substantially greater than that determined by molybdate colourimetry, suggesting that orthophosphate occurred in complexes with humic compounds that were not detected by conventional procedures. Our results suggest that organisms able to use recalcitrant soil organic P may have a competitive advantage in environments under enhanced atmospheric N deposition. 
40800620|We followed a long-term (up to 503 days) microbial mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from lake water in a bioassay and described the kinetics of biodgradation with a new model based on a reactivity continuum approach. The biodegradability of DOC was expressed as the probability of biodgradation, which was assumed to follow a beta distribution. We compared the performance of our beta model to five earlier models: the simplest first order kinetic model, two G models, the power model and the gamma model. The simplest first order kinetic model described the decreasing microbial mineralization of DOC poorly (r = 0.73), but the other models explained the observed kinetics of biodgradation well (r > 0.95). When we assessed the extrapolation power of models beyond the length of the bioassay by reducing the amount of data, the predictive power of the G models was poor. Instead, the beta model predicted the biodgradation kinetics consistently and correctly based on even only three observations in time. The beta model provided also long-term predictions (up to 5,000 years) along the observed long-term mineralization trajectory of organic carbon in sediments. Additionally, the beta model formulated the biodegradability continuum of DOC, which was skewed towards low biodegradability. During the bioassay, the skew towards low biodegradability increased as the most biodegradable parts of DOC were consumed. The beta model describes the biodegradability continuum quantitatively and can predict biodgradation in a realistic manner, thus, improving our understanding about the biodegradability and the role of natural organic matter in the environment.
20456408|This study examined the nitrogen (N) dynamics of a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP)-dominated chronosequence in Manitoba, Canada. The seven sites studied each contained separate well- and poorly drained stands, originated from stand-killing wildfires, and were between 3 and 151 years old. Our goals were to (i) measure total N concentration ([N]) of all biomass components and major soil horizons; (ii) compare N content and select vegetation N cycle processes among the stands; and (iii) examine relationships between ecosystem C and N cycling for these stands. Vegetation [N] varied significantly by tissue type, species, soil drainage, and stand age; woody debris [N] increased with decay state and decreased with debris size. Soil [N] declined with horizon depth but did not vary with stand age. Total (live + dead) biomass N content ranged from 18.4 to 99.7 g N m in the well-drained stands and 37.8-154.6 g N m in the poorly drained stands. Mean soil N content (380.6 g N m) was unaffected by stand age. Annual vegetation N requirement (5.9 and 8.4 g N m yr in the middle-aged well- and poorly drained stands, respectively) was dominated by trees and fine roots in the well-drained stands, and bryophytes in the poorly drained stands. Fraction N retranslocated was significantly higher in deciduous than evergreen tree species, and in older than younger stands. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was significantly lower in bryophytes than in trees, and in deciduous than in evergreen trees. Tree NUE increased with stand age, but overall stand NUE was roughly constant (150 g g N) across the entire chronosequence.

1469833| The effect of microrelief and vegetation on methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emission was investigated in a wet polygonal tundra of the Lena Delta, Northern Siberia (72.37N, 126.47E). Total and plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> fluxes were measured by closed-chamber techniques at two typical sites within a low-centred polygon. During the study period, total CH<sub>4</sub> flux averaged 28.0  5.4 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> in the depressed polygon centre and only 4.3  0.8 mg m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> at the elevated polygon rim. This substantial small-scale spatial variability of CH<sub>4</sub> emission was caused by strong differences of hydrologic conditions within the microrelief of the polygon, which affected aeration status and organic matter content of the soils as well as the vegetation cover. Beside water table position, the vegetation cover was a major factor controlling CH<sub>4</sub> emission from polygonal tundra. It was shown that the dominant vascular plant of the study area, Carex aquatilis, possesses large aerenchyma, which serve as pathways for substantial plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> transport. The importance of plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> flux was strongly influenced by the position of the water table relative to the main root horizon. Plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> transport accounted for about two-thirds of the total flux in the wet polygon centre and for less than one-third of the total flux at the moist polygon rim. A clipping experiment and microscopic-anatomical studies suggested that plant-mediated CH<sub>4</sub> transport via C. aquatilis plants is driven only by diffusion and is limited by the high diffusion resistance of the dense root exodermes. 
1469933|Previous studies have shown that fertilization with nitrogen depresses overall microbial biomass and activity in soil. In the present study we broaden our understanding of this phenomenon by studying the seasonality of responses of specific microbial functional groups to chronic nitrogen additions in alpine tundra soils. We measured soil enzyme activities, mineralization kinetics for 8 substrates, biomass of 8 microbial functional groups, and changes in N and carbon pools in the soil. Our approach allowed us to compare the ability of the soil microbial biomass to utilize various substrates in addition to allowing us to estimate changes in biomass of microbial functional groups that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Overall microbial activity and biomass was reduced in fertilized plots, whereas pools of N in the soil and microbial biomass N were higher in fertilized plots. The negative effects of N were most prominent in the summer. Biomass of the dominant microbial functional groups recovered in fertilized soils during the winter and nitrogen storage in microbial biomass was higher in fertilized soils in the autumn and winter than in the summer. Microbial immobilization of N may therefore be a significant sink for added N during autumn and winter months when plants are not active. One large microbial group that did not recover in the winter in fertilized soils was phenol mineralizers, possibly indicating selection against microbes with enzyme systems for the breakdown of phenolic compounds and complex soil organic matter. Overall, this work is a step towards understanding how chronic N additions affect the structure and biogeochemical functioning of soil microbial communities.
1469666|Dynamics of dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) and capacity to absorb light (color) are determined by in-lake and external properties and processes. In this study, the influence of external factors such as rainfall and solar radiation on DOC and color dynamics was assessed for a small forested lake. DOC and absorption coefficients at 440 nm (a<sub>440</sub>) ranged 4-fold from 0.46 to 1.62 mM and from 3.4 to 14.8 m<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. DOC and a<sub>440</sub> varied synchronously, but an important percentage of the variability (26%) in a<sub>440</sub> was not explained by DOC. The resulting twofold variation in the molar absorption coefficient of DOC suggested significant seasonal changes in chromophoric content. Both DOC and a<sub>440</sub> were positive and significantly related to cumulative rainfall. Solar radiation, however, only appeared to influence a<sub>440</sub> dynamics. This influence was mediated by photobleaching. Photobleaching coefficients (k<sub>b</sub>) were higher in fall and spring relative to the summer. This seasonal variability in k<sub>b</sub> values was related to monthly rainfall. The influence of photobleaching on a<sub>440</sub> dynamics was evaluated by comparing the half life of a<sub>440</sub> in the water column with water residence time (WRT). For the study lake, photobleaching contributed notably to a<sub>440</sub> dynamics during the dry periods when WRT was longer than the a<sub>440</sub> half life. DOC dynamics, however, were not related to solar radiation because photomineralization was considerably slower than photobleaching.
1469779|Incident rainfall is a major source of nutrient input to a forest ecosystem and the consequent throughfall and stemflow contribute to nutrient cycling. These rain-based fluxes were measured over 12 mo in two forest types in Korup National Park, Cameroon, one with low (LEM) and one with high (HEM) ectomycorrhizal abundances of trees. Throughfall was 96.6 and 92.4% of the incident annual rainfall (5370 mm) in LEM and HEM forests respectively; stemflow was correspondingly 1.5 and 2.2%. Architectural analysis showed that ln(funneling ratio) declined linearly with increasing ln(basal area) of trees. Mean annual inputs of N, P, K, Mg and Ca in incident rainfall were 1.50, 1.07, 7.77, 5.25 and 9.27 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, and total rain-based inputs to the forest floor were 5.0, 3.2, 123.4, 14.4 and 37.7 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> respectively. The value for K is high for tropical forests and that for N is low. Nitrogen showed a significantly lower loading of throughfall and stemflow in HEM than in LEM forest, this being associated in the HEM forest with a greater abundance of epiphytic bryophytes which may absorb more N. Incident rainfall provided c. 35% of the gross input of P to the forest floor (i.e., rain-based plus small litter inputs), a surprisingly high contribution given the sandy P-poor soils. At the start of the wet season leaching of K from the canopy was particularly high. Calcium in the rain was also highest at this time, most likely due to washing off of dry-deposited Harmattan dusts. It is proposed that throughfall has an important 'priming' function in the rapid decomposition of litter and mineralization of P at the start of the wet season. The contribution of P inputted from the atmosphere appears to be significant when compared to the rates of P mineralization from leaf litter.
1469224|Anthropogenic food and energy production extensively mobilize reactive nitrogen (N) in the watershed of the North Atlantic Ocean (NAO). There is wide spread N distribution by both hydrologic and atmospheric processes within the watershed of the NAO, resulting in reactive N accumulation in terrestrial systems. Net denitrification in most estuaries and continental shelves exceeds the amount of N supplied to the shelves by rivers and requires a supply of nitrate from the open ocean. Thus riverine N is only transported to the open ocean in a few areas with the flow from a few major rivers (e.g., Amazon). Atmospheric N deposition to the open ocean has increased and may increase the productivity of the surface ocean. In addition, as a consequence of increased Fe deposition to the open ocean (due in part to anthropogenic processes), the rate of biological N-fixation may have increased resulting in N accumulation in the ocean. Phosphorus (P) is also mobilized by anthropogenic processes (primarily food production). Relative to N, more of the P is transported across the shelf to the open ocean from both estuaries and major rivers. There are several consequences of the increased availability of N and P that are unique to each element. However, the control on primary productivity in both coastal and open ocean ecosystems is dependent on a complex and poorly understood interaction between N and P mobilization and availability.
1469150| Rates of rhizospheric methane oxidation were evaluated by aerobic incubations of subcores collected in flooded anoxic soils populated by emergent macrophytes, by greenhouse whole plant incubations, and by CH<sub>4</sub> stable isotopic analysis. Subcore incubations defined upper limits for rhizospheric methane oxidation on an areal basis which were equal to or greater than emission rates. These rates are considered upper limits because O<sub>2</sub> did not limit CH<sub>4</sub> uptake as is likely to occur in situ. The ratio of maximum potential methane oxidation (MO) to methane emission (ME) ranged from 0.7 to 1.9 in Louisiana rice (Oryza sativa), from 1.0 to 4.0 in a N. Florida Sagittaria lancifolia marsh, and from 5.6 to 51 in Everglades Typha domingensis and Cladium jamaicense areas. Methane oxidation/methane emission ratios determined in whole plant incubations of Sagittaria lancifolia under oxic and anoxic conditions ranged from 0.5 to 1.6. Methane oxidation activity associated with emergent aquatic macrophytes was found primarily in fine root material. A weak correlation was observed between live root biomass and CH<sub>4</sub> uptake in Typha. Rhizomes showed small or zero rates of methane uptake and no uptake was associated with plant stems. Methane stable isotope data from a S. lancifolia marsh were as follows: CH<sub>4</sub> emitted from plants: -61.6  0.3; CH<sub>4</sub> within stems: -42.0  0.2; CH<sub>4</sub> within sedimentary bubbles: -51.7  0.3). The <sup>13</sup>C enrichment observed relative to emitted CH<sub>4</sub> could be due to preferential mobilization of CH<sub>4</sub> containing the lighter isotope and/or the action of methanotrophic bacteria. 
4151491| Coarse woody debris (CWD) may create a spatially discrete soil imprint through the release of carbon rich, acidic dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM has been implicated in many soil processes such as humus formation, nutrient immobilization, podzolization, and the dissolution of soil minerals. We investigated a potential CWD imprint on soil chemistry by sampling leachates and soil solutions under CWD at different stages of decay and under the forest floor as controls. Solutions were analyzed for total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and polyphenol concentrations. DOC was further separated by chemical fractionation. We also sampled soil from underneath CWD and from control areas without CWD. Samples were analyzed for pH, base saturation, exchangeable acidity, and several aluminum and iron fractions. The pH of CWD leachates was lower (p 0.001) and contained more polyphenols (p  0.0001) and DOC than control leachates, although chemical DOC fractions from CWD and the forest floor were similar. Surface mineral soils under CWD were lower in pH (p 0.005), had more exchangeable acidity (p < 0.002) and more exchangeable aluminum (p  0.04) and iron (p  0.06) than forest floor soils. At depths greater than 5 cm, there were no differences between forest floor soils and soils under CWD. Our results suggest that CWD in the middle stages of decay acidifies the surface soil as it decomposes by decreasing exchangeable bases and increasing exchangeable acidity and aluminum. Soils under the most highly decayed CWD, or deeper soils were not affected by CWD. Although we hypothesized that well-decayed CWD would show a spatially explicit imprint on soils, the effect of CWD on soil chemistry was small and limited to surface mineral soils. 
20456419|Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transport/retention was determined at four sites in three rainforest streams draining La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. La Selva is located at the base of the last remaining intact rainforest transect from 30 m above sea level to 3000 m along the entire Caribbean slope of Central America. Steam SRP levels can be naturally high there due to regional, geothermal groundwater discharged at ambient temperature. Monitoring since 1988 has revealed distinctive long-term differences in background SRP and total P (TP) for three streams in close proximity, and identified the impact of ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) events on SRP-enriched reaches. Mean interannual SRP concentrations ( standard deviation) were 89  53g/l in the Salto (1988-1996), 21  39g/l in the Pantano (1988-1998), and 26  35g/l in the Sabalo (1988-1996). After January, 1997 the separate upland-lowland contributions to discharge and SRP load were determined monthly in the Salto. SRP in Upper Salto was low (19  8g/l, 1997-2002) until enriched at the upland-lowland transition by regional groundwater. Mean SRP concentration in Lower Salto (108  104g/l) was typically highest February-April, the driest months, and lowest July-September, the wettest. SRP concentration was positively correlated to the inverse of discharge in Lower Salto when ENSO data were omitted (1992 and 1998-1999), but not in the Upper Salto, Pantano, or Sabalo. TP was positively correlated to the inverse of discharge in all three streams when ENSO data were omitted. High SRP springs and seeps along the Lower Salto contributed 36% of discharge but 85% of SRP export 1997-2001. Annual SRP flux from the total Salto watershed (1997-2001) averaged 2.9 kg/ha year, but only 0.6 kg/ha year from the Upper Salto. A dye tracer injection showed that pore water environments were distinctly different between Upper and Lower Salto. Upper Salto had high surface water-pore water exchange, high dissolved oxygen, low SRP, and low conductivity similar to surface water, and Lower Salto had low surface water-pore water exchange, low dissolved oxygen, high SRP, and high conductivity reflecting geothermal groundwater influence. SRP export from the Salto was controlled by regional groundwater transfer, which in similar volcanic settings could be a significant P source. However, ENSO events modified the SRP concentration in the Salto suggesting that long-term monitoring is required to understand underlying SRP dynamics and P flux to downstream communities.
24715137|Solute chemistry and stable isotope tracers of NO were used to assess bacterial NO production and denitrification in a High Arctic glacial ecosystem during 2009. Changes in the NO concentration and the ONO in all the proglacial streams revealed that up to 95 % of total NO was most likely bacterially-derived during low flow conditions towards the end of the summer (day of year 250). However, overlapping ranges of N values for snow NH, soil organic matter, cryoconite debris and geological nitrogen in host rocks mean that neither the preferred substrate(s), nor the pathway (i.e. nitrification or simple mineralisation) can be discerned. The most plausible explanation for the bacterial production of NO is nitrification in snowmelt-fed flowpaths through avalanche fans that flank the glacier and along subglacial drainage pathways at the glacier bed. Interestingly, there was no evidence for denitrification in subglacial outflow, which is contrary to earlier research at this site. Instead, increases in the NNO of up to 20  downstream of the glacier margin, suggests that denitrification in the glacier forefield and/or the sediments that flank it was most discernable during 2009. Our observations therefore suggest that poorly understood temporal variations in the mixing ratio of nitrifying and denitrifying flowpaths occur in this glacial ecosystem.
1469199|The individual influence of sulfate reducing and brown phototrophic sulfur bacteria from Lake Kinneret on the metalimnetic redox conditions was investigated by simulating the hydrochemical and microbiological conditions in a specially designed chemostat. The results show a strong correlation between measured redox values and the prevailing hydrogen sulfide concentration leading to a linear relationship. Changes in this relationship allowed differentiation between the on-going microbial processes, sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation. The comparison of in vitro and in situ redox values shows that the results of the simulation experiments agree with the data previously measured in the metalimnion of Lake Kinneret.
41490448|Solid phase Fe and S fractions were examined in an acid sulfate soil (ASS) wetland undergoing remediation via tidal inundation. Considerable diagenetic enrichment of reactive Fe(III) oxides (HCl-and dithionite-extractable) occurred near the soil surface (00.05 m depth), where extremely large concentrations up to 3534 mol/g accounted for ~90% of the total Fe pool. This major source of reactive Fe exerts a substantial influence on S cycling and the formation, speciation and transformation of reduced inorganic S (RIS) in tidally inundated ASS. Under these geochemical conditions, acid volatile sulfide (AVS; up to 57 mol/g) and elemental sulfur (S; up to 41 mol/g) were the dominant fractions of RIS in near surface soils. AVS-S to pyrite-S ratios exceeded 2.9 near the surface, indicating that abundant reactive Fe favoured the accumulation of AVS minerals and S over pyrite. This is supported by the significant correlation of poorly crystalline Fe with AVS-S and S-S contents (r = 0.83 and r = 0.85, respectively, P < 0.01). XANES spectroscopy provided direct evidence for the presence of a greigite-like phase in AVS-S measured by chemical extraction. While the abundant reactive Fe may limit the transformation of AVS minerals and S to pyrite during early diagenesis (~ 5 years), continued sulfidisation over longer time scales is likely to eventually lead to enhanced sequestration of S within pyrite (with a predicted 8% pyrite by mass). These findings provide an important understanding of sulfidisation processes occurring in reactive Fe-enriched, tidally inundated ASS landscapes.
