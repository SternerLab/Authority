41781972|Idiospermum australiense (Diels) S. T. Blake is based on Calycanthus australiensis Diels following the rediscovery of this species previously known only from one imperfect specimen now lost, the description based on it, and a sketch of a leaf and flower. The embryos in the recently collected material with three or four distinct very large peltately attached fleshy cotyledons are quite unlike those of any described family; the very many spiral tepals associated with a hollowed receptacle and a single carpel and laminar stamens with exalbuminous seeds are unique combinations of characters. Idiospermum occupies an isolated position in the Magnoliales.
41781955|Carpobrotus N. E. Br. and Sarcozona J. M. Black are distinguished from other genera segregated from Mesembryanthemum by having fleshy indhiscent fruits and partly axile as well as parietal placentation. C. glaucescens (Haw.) Schwantes, C. virescens (Haw.) Schwantes (C. abbreviatus (Haw.) Schwantes), C. rossii (Haw.) Schwantes and C. modestus sp. nov. are indigenous. In the past these have been identified with C. aequilaterus (Haw.) N. E. Br. (Mesembryanthemum aequilaterum Haw., M. aequilaterale Willd.), but this name rightly belongs to a species from Chile, California and Mexico naturalized in Australia and of which C. disparilis N. E. Br. and C. chilensis (Mol.) N. E. Br. are synonyms. C. edulis (L.) L. Bolus from South Africa is also naturalized. The taxa were discriminated from the study of living plants. Distinguishing characters not hitherto used were found in the dots on the sepals, streaks on petals and filaments, number of petals and stamens, length of anthers, shape of calyx-tube, shape of seeds, pattern of branching, and leaf-index. Neotypes were chosen for Haworth's names. Sarcozona is an endemic genus of two species including S. bicarinata sp. nov.
41781951|Field observations and herbarium studies indicate that populations intermediate in leaf characters between Eucalyptus populnea F. Muell. and E. brownii Maid. & Cambage occur over almost two degrees of latitude in central Queensland.
41782020|Combretaceae is a pantropic family containing 18 genera, four having native or naturalised species in Australia. Terminalia is a genus estimated to contain between 200-300 species distributed throughout the tropical world and is the largest and most critical genus in Australia with 29 species. Two species, T. arenicola and T. savannimla are described as new, and T. supranitidifolia is a new name for T. discolor F. Muell. non Spreng. The morphological features used to distinguish the species have been critically examined, thus enabling clarification of the variation within the species. Detail studies have been made of the changes in shape which occur during the development of the fruit and of the internal structure of the fruit to give a better delineation of the taxa. Field studies of the species over a number of seasons and over a wide area of their distribution gave useful information on the growth and seasonal changes in the plants and the ecological limitations of their distribution. The flowers, with one exception T. grandiflora, are similar in size and shape so the useful diagnostic characters were found to be fruit size and shape, leaf shape and proportions, and distribution of indumentum. Macropteranthes is a genus endemic in Australia with four species. It is closely related to the genus Lumnitzera which contains two species both being found in Australia. Quisqualis indica has become naturalised in Northern Australia. Distribution, citation of specimens and ecological notes are given for each species.
41781889|The name Melaleuca leucadendron (L.) L. has been used in a very broad sense but correctly refers to one of a complex of ten species distinguished by hitherto overlooked characters in the sepals, indumentum, stamens and foliage correlated with differences in habit. M. saligna Schau., M. arcana sp. nov. and M. stenostachya sp. nov. have smaller flowers and fruits than the others; the name M. saligna has been generally misapplied. M. nervosa (Lindl.) Cheel, M. argentea W. V. Fitzg. and M. dealbata sp. nov. have an indumentum consisting partly of minute, erect, crisped hairs and the sepals are thickened nearly to the margins with the indumentum covering most of the outside. The other species, M. leucadendron (L.) L. (M. mimosoides Schau, etc.), M. cajuputi Powell (M. minor Sm. etc.), M. viridiflora Sol. ex Gaertn. (M. cunninghamii Schau.) and M. quinquenervia (Cav.) S. T. Blake (to which the name M. viridiflora has been misapplied), lack these minute crisped hairs and the sepals have a broad membranous marginal band that is glabrous except for a few short hairs at the extreme edge; M. leucadendron is glabrous, but the others are hairy at least on the young shoots. All groups have broad-leaved species and narrow-leaved species but the form of the leaf varies with the size of the tree. Failure to appreciate some more obvious differences and misapplication of names have made it necessary to consider eight other species that are not closely allied, some of which presented taxonomic and nomenclatural problems of their own; these are M. deanei F. Muell. (the only species not studied in the field), M. groveana Cheel & White, M. sieben Schau., M. lanceolata Otto (M. pubescens Schau.), M. preissiana Schau., M. decora (Salisb.) J. Britten, M. bracteata F. Muell. (M. glaucocalyx Gandoger, M. genistifolia var. coriacea Ewart, Kerr & Derrick, M. daleana Blakely, M. monticola J. M. Black) and M. lasiandra F. Muell. About ninety names are involved, of which thirty-one are "new" synonyms. Of M. leucadendron and the nine species most closely allied to it, about seven hundred collections have been studied, of which four may represent hybrids, but three species are together represented by less than 5% of the collections.
41782017|Twenty-one formally described species of Eremophila occur in Queensland. Each of these is described fully and distinguished from the others by a key to Sections and Species. E. latrobei var. glabra var. nov., E. latrobei forma flava forma nov. and E. bowmanii var. latifolia var. nov. are described. The new combinations Eremophila Section Amphichilus (DC.) L. S. Smith and E. maculata forma flava (F. M. Bail.) L. S. Smith are made. Myoporum tenuifolium Forst, f. is chosen lectotype species of the genus Myoporum.
41781893|Chromosome numbers in L. montevidensis are 2n (3) = 36 for a sterile exclusively garden form, and 2n (4) = 48 for a fertile form that has become widely naturalized.
41781966|Those species of the subseries Brunioideae with regular verticillate leaves are revised. A key for the identification of 12 species is provided. All taxa are described and maps showing their distribution are included. A. adoxa, A. adoxa var. subglabra, A. chippendalei, A. longipedunculata, A. orthotricha and A. perry i are described as new. A. galioides var. glabriflora, A. galioides var. leioclada, and A. baueri ssp. aspera are new combinations based on A. glabriflora Domin, A. leioclada Domin, and A. baueri var. aspera Maiden & Betche respectively.
41781895|Acacia brachycarpa, A. cretata, A. ensifolia and A. saxicola are new species. A. hubbar diana is a new name for A. plagiophylla F. Muell. non Spreng. A. undulijolia A. Cunn. ex G. Don is a synonym of A. uncinata Lindl., and A. holosericea A. Cunn. ex Benth. var. pubescens F. Muell. of A. pellita O. Schwarz. Pods of A. orites Pedley are described.

Cunn. ex G. Don and A. sphaerogemma Maid. & Blakely are recorded from Queensland.
41770390|New diagnostic characters were found for some genera of the Rhynchosporoideae. Gahnia and Lepidosperma have ligules to the leaves; Gahnia has no midrib to the involute leaves, no prophylls in the inflorescence, and usually a dark brown to black endocarp. Baumea differs from Machaerina by the unwinged fruit with a rounded to obpyramidal base, a thick hard endocarp and a more or less spongy mesocarp. Morelotia differs from all in the exactly distichous caducous lower glumes and elongated uppermost internode of the rhachilla of the spikelet. Trachystylis differs from Fimbristylis in leaf anatomy and structure of the spikelet. New species are Gahnia subaequiglumis, Oreobolus acutifolius, Oreobolus oxycarpus, Schoenus pygmaeus and Scirpus tasmanicus. New combinations are Baumea articulata (Cladium articulatum R.

41781987|Acacia resinocostata, A. propinqua (a species previously confused with A. latescens Benth.), A. microsperma, A. aprepta, A. blakei, A. brassii, A. clivicola, A. helicophylla, A. nesophila, A. petraea, A. pubirhachis, A. sericoflora and A. drepanocarpa ssp. latifolia are described as new. A. concurrens is a new name for A. cunninghamii Hook, non G. Don. It is distinguished from A. crassa which is described as new, A. glaucescens var. leiocalyx Domin which is raised to specific rank, and A. longispicata Benth. A. dineura is a synonym of A. latescens. A. pachycarpa F. Muell. and A. tumida F. Muell. are typified and the latter is distinguished from A. difficilis Maiden.
41781978|The acceptance of genera segregated from Danthonia requires the acceptance of Monachather Steud. (M. paradoxa Steud. = Danthonia bipartita F. Muell.) and Plinthanthesis Steud. (P. rodwayi (C. E. Hubbard) comb, nov., P. paradoxa (R. Br.) comb. nov. and P. urvillei Steud. = Danthonia vickeryi (C. E. Hubbard). P. tenuior Steud. becomes Notodanthonia tenuior (Steud.) comb. nov. (= Danthonia purpurascens J. Vickery). The segregated genera are distinguished by means of a key. Four native species of Leptochloa and one hitherto unreported naturalized species (L. filiformis (Lamk.) Beauv.) are distinguished in a key. L. divarieatissima is described as new, L. ciliolata (Jedw.) S. T. Blake is a new combination (Eragrostis ciliolata Jedw.), L. asthenes (R. & S.) C. E. Hubbard is a new synonym and L. debilis Stapf ex C. E. Hubbard is a nomenclatural synonym of Poa imbecilla Forst. from New Zealand.
41782012|Descriptions and a key for the identification of 18 species, ten of which do not occur in Australia, are given. A. wetarensis and A. solandri subsp. kajewskii are described as new and A. simplex, based on Mimosa simplex Sparrm. is a new combination for the species previously known as either A. laurifolia Willd. or A. simplicifolia (L.f.) Druce. A. koaia is treated as a synonym of A. koa. A. solandri subsp. solandri is recorded from New Guinea while A. solandri subsp. kajewskii is confined to the New Hebrides. A. quadrilateralis was erroneously recorded from Timor by Decaisne and A. willardiana from Mexico is excluded from subgenus Heterophyllum. Related species, widely separated geographically, pose phytogeographical problems.
41781953|Two new genera Austromatthaea (Monimiaceae) and Neorites (Proleaceae) are described. Suaeda arbusculoides (Chenopodiaceae), Elaeocarpus stellaris (Elaeocarpaceae), Calycopeplus casuarinoides (Euphorbiaceae), Austromatthaea elegans (Monimiaceae), Myoporum betcheanum & var. pubescens (Myoporaceae), Musgravea heterophylla and Neorites kevediana (Proteaceae), Olax pendula (Olacaceae), Argyrodendron actinophyllum ssp. diversifolium and A. polyandrum (Sterculiaceae), and Clerodendrum parvulum (Verbenaceae) are described as new. Pternandra cyanea (Bl.) Triana (Melastomataceae), Morinda salomonensis Engl. (Rubiaceae), and Lasiopetalum jerrugineum Sm. (Sterculiaceae) are recorded from Queensland. The genus Pternandra has not previously been recorded from Australia, nor Lasiopetalum from Queensland.
41781891|P. monticola, P. longipedata A. Cunn. ex DC. and P. neglecta G. L. Davis each have a chromosome complement of 20. P. canescens A. Cunn. ex DC. is recorded from Queensland. These species are distinguished from others in Queensland in a key.
41782006|Plants previously known as Solatium nigrum in Australia are S. opacum A.Br. & Bouch (2n = 72) and S. nodiflorum Jacq. subsp. nutans R. J. Henderson subsp. nov. (2n = 24) which are considered native, and the naturalized S. nigrum L. subsp. nigrum (2n = 72) and subsp. schultesii (Opiz) Wessely (2n = 72), S. nodiflorum Jiacq. subsp. nodiflorum (2n = 24), S. gracilius Herter (2n = 24), S. nitidibaccatum Bitt. (2n. = 24) and S. villosum Mill. (2n = 48). S. furcatum Dun. (2n = 72) and S. retroflexum Dun. (2n = 48) are also naturalized to a very minor extent. S. scabrum Mill. (S. melanocerasum All. syn nov.) (2n = 72) and S. douglasii Dun. (2n = 24) have been grown occasionally though neither has been found naturalized. A form of S. nodiflorum subsp. nodiflorum grown from seed from U.S.S.R. is hexaploid (2n = 72). A key for the identification of 11 species of Solanum sect. Solanum native to or naturalized in Australia is given. With the exception of the excluded S. tri flor um Nutt., each of these species is described and its distribution in Australia based on herbarium specimens, is mapped. Cross-breeding data help to explain anomalies observed in pollen viability counts. All included species are principally self-pollinating. Fl progeny of S. nodiflorum subsp. nodiflorum x subsp. nutans is 18-25% pollen fertile, F2 is 0-99% pollen fertile. S. nodiflorum subsp. nutans and S. opacum are genetically isolated by hybrid mviability.
41781960|Plectranthus L'Herit., Rabdosia (Bl.) Hassk. (Isodon (Benth.) Kudo, Amethystanthus Nakai, Homalocheilos J. K. Morton), Ceratanthus F. Muell. ex G. Taylor, Coleus Lour, and probably Solenostemon Thonning should be treated as distinct genera. Plectranthus is represented by many species in Africa and a few on the Asiatic mainland. Fourteen species are found in Australia, chiefly in Queensland, of which P. alloplectus, P. amicorum, P. apreptus, P. argentatus, P. diversus, P. gratus, P. intraterraneus, P. mirus, P. spectabilis and P. suaveolens are described as new. P. congest us R. Br. extends to New Guinea and Timor and P. parviflorus Willd. (P. parviflorus Spreng, in Henckel, non R. Br. nee Guerke, P. paniculatus Jacq., P. australis R. Br., P. sieben Benth.) extends to Hawaii, but the record of its occurrence in New Guinea was based on a specimen of Ocimum sp. P. graveolens R. Br., P. foetidus Benth. and P. forsten Benth. are distinguished from P. parviflorus, P. forsten being found only in the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, Fiji and Samoa but is in cultivation under the name of P. coleoides. P. madagascariensis (Pers.) Benth. from Mauritius and P. zeylanicus Benth. also differ from P. parviflorus and from one another. P. zeylanicus is cultivated in Ceylon but native to South Africa where it is known by the later name P. tomentosus Benth. P. klossii S. Moore is restricted to Timor and New Guinea and P. petraeus Backer ex Adelbert to Java. All the Australian species were grown and twelve of them examined in the field. Useful diagnostic characters were found in the habit, number of teeth on the leaf, absence or distribution on stem and leaf of gland-tipped hairs and sessile glands, retrorse or antrorse direction of non-glandular hairs on stem and lower surface of leaf, degree of bend in the corolla-tube and shape of lobes of the fruiting calyx, especially the upper lip. Only the last-mentioned had been used by earlier workers; the others were first recognized and their value assessed from living plants which shrink much during the preparation of dried specimens often with considerable distortion of leaf shape. Few wild hybrid plants were found but five species were involved in spontaneous hybrids in the garden. P. parviflorus Willd. and P. parviflorus Spreng, in Henckel are two different names published in the same year based on plants cultivated in Germany, the former of unknown origin, the latter said to have originated from Peru. Both refer to the same Australian species which is not P. parviflorus R. Br. The acceptance of Willdenow's name as correct followed from the determination of the dates of publication of his Hortus Berolensis, Henckel's Adumbrationes . . . and Jacquin's Fragmenta Botanica. The species varies much in the density of indumentum and in habit, both of which are influenced by the environment.
41781984|The genus Neurachne comprises N. alopecuroidea R. Br., N. munroi (F. Muell.) F. Muell., N. lanigera sp. nov., N. minor sp. nov., N. qeenslandica sp. nov. and N. tenuifolia sp. nov. Two new genera, Paraneurachne S. T. Blake and Thyridolepis S. T. Blake, are described for other species with the new combinations Paraneurachne muelleri (Hack.) S. T. Blake (N. muelleri Hack., N. elementa Domin), Thyridolepis mitchelliana (Nees) S. T. Blake, T. multiculmis (Pilger) S. T. Blake and T. xerophila (Domin) S. T. Blake. These genera constitute a new tribe Neurachneae of the Panicoideae sens. lat. All species are restricted to Australia.
41781969|Trachymene cyanantha differs from T. glaucifolia (F. Muell.) Benth. and T. ochracea especially by having dimorphic papillae on the solitary mericarp: it has a chromosome complement of 2n= 22.
41782009|Of the seven species of Cymbopogon and seven of Schizachyrium found in Australia, C. queenslandicus, S. crinizonatum, S. dolosum, S. occultum and S. perplexum are described as new. These, and also C. bombycinus, C. obtectus, C. procerus and S. pachyathron are restricted to Australia. C. ambiguus extends to Timor. C. globosus is a Malesian species now reported from Queensland. C. refractus extends eastward to Hawaii and Mangareva. S. fragile and S. pseudeulalia have wide ranges outside Australia. The species of Cymbopogon are tufted often tall aromatic perennials found growing in sandy or stony soils or among rocks; one or more species is found in every mainland state. Distinguishing characters are found in the distribution and relative length of the hairs in the racemes, the shape and nervature of the lower glume of the sessile spikelet. C. ambiguus, C. bombycinus and C. procerus have permanently suberect not finally reflexed racemes. C. bombycinus is unique in having pubescent spatheoles and broad flattened recurving old leaf sheaths. C. globosus differs from the others in its relatively short inflorescences and in having the spikelets of the homogamous pairs greatly reduced or caducous. C. refractus differs from all other species of the genus in the relatively stout often nearly or quite glabrous joints and pedicels and persistent somewhat uncinate pedicellate spikelets. A few plants appear to be hybrids mostly with C. refractus as one parent. The species appear to be of minor value as forage plants but some are quite ornamental. All species of Schizachyrium are small slender annuals found chiefly on sandy often shallow soils often in open habitats in the northern and north-eastern parts of the continent. Useful diagnostic characters were found in the dorsal or lateral compression of the spikelet, as well as its shape in dorsal view, the shape and direction of the callus-scar, the embryo, the hair-pattern on the joints and pedicels, and the ratio of length of leaf-blade to its sheath. Most species are very variable.
