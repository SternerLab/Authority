43390659|The idea that bryophytes form a truly ancient lineage of plants rests upon inadequate fossil evidence of their presumed lower Paleozoic origins from Charalean-like or Coleochaetalean-like algae. In this regard a special challenge is the unequivocal interpretation of the biphasic life cycle of bryophyte-like plant fossils. Unique among land plants in having a dominant gametophyte phase, bryophytes present opportunities for a broad array of research not readily undertaken in sporophyte-dominated organisms. This is enhanced by the ease with which bryophytes in culture can be manipulated experimentally and subjected to analytical testing. Such attributes have permitted numerous recent advances in what is known about the cell biology and physiology of this group of plants. Progress is also evident in deciphering the natural products chemistry of bryophytes. Of far reaching importance are recent advancements in understanding speciation and genetic diversity within species. Where bryophytes are vegetation dominants (e.g., polar, arctic, and boreal regions, and low latitude-high elevation forests), the importance of research involving these organisms will increase in proportion to environmental pressures created by the expanding human population and its agricultural and industrial base.
43390662|Protonemata of Ceratodon grow up in the dark when cultured on nutrient supplemented media. Both gravitropic sensing and differential growth (curvature) occur in or close to the tip of the apical cell, and tip growth is tightly coupled to tip orientation. When protonemata are reoriented 90, the tip grows down slightly (wrong-way curvature) before then curving up. In horizontal protonemata, there is extensive sedimentation of amyloplasts in a specific zone located behind the apical dome. This sedimentation could function in gravitropic sensing since it precedes upward curvature. This hypothesis is also supported by data from centrifugation experiments. However, little or no sedimentation occurs before wrong-way curvature; thus, if sensing for this earlier phase of gravitropism relies upon amyloplast mass, then extensive sedimentation is not necessary. Comparison of upright and inverted cells shows that some amyloplast sedimentation also occurs in vertical cells, especially between the sedimentation zone and the nucleus. However, amyloplasts do not sediment completely through vertical cells except when protonemata are treated with microtubule inhibitors. Thus, microtubules influence the direction and extent of amyloplast sedimentation. In upward curving cells, microtubules become enriched in the lower flank of the Golgi zone behind the apical dome. We hypothesize that amyloplast sedimentation induces an enrichment in microtubules that results in upward growth.
43390660|The analysis of developmental mutants of Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) Br. Eur., including phytohormone-insensitive types and hormone overproducing strains, has revealed key developmental transitions and clarified the roles of auxins and cytokmins in regulating gametophytic morphogenesis. Also, genetic analysis of some categories of developmental mutants has provided insight into the complexity of certain morphogenetic phenomena. Further advances, including the isolation of developmental genes, identification of their products and mode of action, as well as elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for controlling their expression, will require utilization of the tools of modern molecular genetics. Almost certainly, the establishment of reliable methods for genetically transforming P. patens will be central to these efforts. Here, the generation of stably transformed P. patens by the introduction into its cells of a plasmid, pB1426, is described. This plasmid possesses two marker genes, engineered for expression in eukaryotic cells, which facilitate the selection and recognition of moss transformants. Preliminary analysis of the transformants suggests that, in most cases, the introduced plasmid is not integrated into the moss's genome; instead it appears to remain free and functions as an autonomous replicon. The application of a novel approach, computer-modelling with Lindenmayer systems (L-systems), has allowed additional insight into the nature and complexity of P. patens morphogenesis at the cell and tissue levels and is described briefly.
43390661|Genetic markers from horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis jndicate that Rhizomnium pseudopunctatum is an allopolyploid whose haploid progenitors were genetically very similar to present-day R. gracile and R. magnifolium. Because the progenitors are genetically very distinct (mean genetic identity, I = 0.687), R. pseudopunctatum displays fixed heterozygosity at about one- third of the 16 loci surveyed. Remarkably low levels of genetic polymorphism in R. gracile and R. magnifolium preclude any certainty on the issue of possible multiple origins of R. pseudopunctatum. We detected three alleles unique to the allopolyploid, only one of which occurred in high enough frequency and in sufficient numbers of geographically separated populations that it could not be explained simply as a product of post-hybridization mutation. Only one locus in the polyploid showed any possible evidence of silencing of duplicated genes. It therefore appears likely that R. pseudopunctatum originated very recently, perhaps during the Pleistocene, when the ranges of its boreal progenitors were displaced to the south. Moreover, bottlenecks in population size that occurred in association with this southward migration may explain the low levels of genetic variation in R. gracile and R. magnifolium. Finally, it appears that the striking lack of genetic differentiation among populations of these mosses, even between intercontinentally disjunct sites, is due to recent recolonization of deglaciated areas only 5-8  10 years Rhizomnium pseudopunctatum joins Plagiomnium medium as the only documented allopolyploid mosses, further substantiating that reticulate evolution is possible in bryophytes.
43390663|The cytoskeletai structures that characterize the cell cycle in vegetative tissues of higher plantscortical array of interphase, preprophase band of microtubules (PPB), spindle, phragmoplastare highly evolved. Study of the lower land plants (bryophytes and lycopsids) has provided some clues to the divergent evolution of cytoskeletai structures associated with cell division in plants and animals. The diverse mechanisms of cell division surviving in lower land plants suggests a stepwise evolution from typical algal mitosis and cytokinesis. Hoop-like cortical microtubules, anastral spindles, and structures resembling PPBs and phragmoplasts are all present in certain extant algae, and are firmly established in the bryophytes. Within extant members of the bryophytes, we can trace steps in the evolution of the diffuse plant microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and introduction of the PPB into the cytokinetic apparatus. In bryophytes, the material associated with microtubule organization has come to be associated with membranes, e.g. endoplasmic reticulum in polar organizers, the plastid envelope in monoplastidic cells, or the nuclear envelope in polyplastidic cells. Some understanding of the existence of highly specialized ways in which plant cells control the cycling and organization of tubulin can be gained by studying nature's experiments in the lower land plants where diversity serves to emphasize commonalities.
43390664|The perceived roles for place-dependent suppression of cell division in morphogenesis and phylogeny derives from the premise that once cell proliferation starts in a developing plant or plant part, there must be some mechanism to suppress these growth processes at specific times and in specific places, else plants or their parts would have no predictable size or shape. Since the beginning stages of development of many plants or plant parts are virtually indistinguishable, the hypothesis, which logically follows is, "that many if not most of the differences by which we distinguish the form changes that occur during the stages of ontogeny and the course of phylogeny are due to differences with respect to the time and place cell proliferation and/or enlargement is suppressed." We propose three important roles for place-dependent suppression in plant morphogenesis and phylogeny. The first role is in establishing apical meristematic regions in the transition from diffuse to apical growth that occurs during the early stages of ontogeny in all extant land plants manifesting apical growth. This role was presumably established early in the phylogenetic origin of embryophytes from their pre-embryophytic ancestors. The second role of localised suppression is to stop the further development of specific organ primordia after they are initiated. As a consequence there is an apparent loss of either the number or kinds of parts laid down in meristems thereby resulting in the process referred to as "reductive" or "regressive" evolution. An indirect effect of a selective suppression of primordia development in meristems may be a change in distribution of tensile and compressive forces distributed through both the apoplast and symplast of the meristems and a concommitant change in cell division patterns. The third role is the modulation of size and shape of organs having a determinate mode of development, as indicated in our starting premise, that suppression of proliferation generates form. One means by which spacial regulation of suppression appears to be regulated is through the interrelated actions of auxin, ethylene and certain arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). AGPs are a class of hydroxyprolinecontaining glycoproteins associated with the plasma membranes and extracellular matrices of all intact plant cells. Auxin translocation is probably the principle determinant of where (place) suppression occurs. The onset of ethylene synthesis, whether triggered by auxin or some other factor(s), is probably most responsible for determining when (time) suppression occurs. One or more AGPs probably determine how or whether suppression is maintained in potentially proliferating cells.
