# About
This module contains code to create training sets. 

Three sets are generated. 
1. article_match_set
2. article_non_match_set
3. name_mixed_set

The folder **sql** contains sql files used to create the above sets and store them in the database as views to reuse the results later.

# Usage
```bash
python create_sets.py
```
