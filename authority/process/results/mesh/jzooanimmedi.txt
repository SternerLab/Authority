10.2307/20460169|Mycoplasma sp. and Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis were isolated in large numbers from joint fluid and blood in a 4-week-old barn owl (Tyto alba) which developed soft tissue swellings caused by trauma of talon implants from sibling owls. The wounds resulted in osteomyelitis of several long bones. The bird died three days after clinical signs were detected.
10.2307/20460173|Excision orthoplasty consisting of left femoral head and neck ostectomy was performed on an adult female Giant anteater, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, due to chronic bilateral degenerative joint disease of the coxofemoral joints. Surgery was performed following chronic rear leg lameness, gradual weight loss and general decreased function and activity of the animal over a period of several years. A severely affected joint was disclosed and the surgery consisted of a successful salvage procedure following the anteater's anesthetic recovery, a steady weight gain and a return to moderate function of the operated limb over a period of several weeks.
10.2307/20094850|A 10-yr-old male Jimela topi (Damaliscus lunatus jimela) born in captivity was evaluated by Veterinary Services, San Diego Zoo. The animal had a history of weight loss in the presence of a good appetite, abdominal distension, and intermittent soft feces. Clinical evaluation revealed a marginal anemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, a lymphocyte-neutrophil reversal, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Radiographs, per rectal colonic biopsy, comparative intradermal tuberculin skin tests, and attempts to isolate Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were all negative. Fecal smears revealed abundant acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of Johne's disease was made and the animal was euthanized. Necropsy revealed an emaciated animal with a mildly thickened and hyperemic small intestine, cecum, and large intestine; lymphadenopathy of the colonic, intestinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes; and a mottled, soft friable liver. Histopathologic evaluation revealed chronic diffuse granulomatous inflammatory infiltrates in the small and large intestine, intra-abdominal lymph nodes, and hepatic peripheral lobular regions. There were abundant macrophages in all these tissues which contained large numbers of densely packed intracytoplasmic acid-fast bacilli. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis was isolated from the fecal cultures. Because of the potential transmission of Johne's disease to two adult female and three juvenile topi cohabiting with the infected animal, all herd mates were euthanized. Serologic, comparative skin tests, histopathologic evaluation, and fecal examination failed to indicate the presence of mycobacterial organisms or disease in any of these animals.
10.2307/20094867|Fourteen brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) were injected with radiopaque silicone rubber in the left carotid artery at the level of C4, radiographed, and dissected to study the vascular anatomy of the head and gular sac. The main blood supply to the head was the left carotid artery, supplying right and left internal carotids. Branches from these vessels ran parallel with branches of the cranial cephalic veins. Bilaterally, two pairs of these vessels traveled on each side of the hyoid bone and met in the midline as four pairs of vessels coursing down the gular sac sending branches laterally. One pair of mandibular branches of arteries and veins traveled under each mandibular ramus and sent branches medially into the gular sac. Anastomoses between the mandibular and central gular supply were not observed. The gular sac was multilayered, with inner and outer epithelial layers covering a highly vascular, muscular layer. The outer epithelial layer covered a subepithelial melanocyte layer. Respiratory openings included a slitlike opening on the roof of the oral cavity, the choana, and a short rima infundibulum caudal to the choana connecting the pharynx to the infundibulum pharyngotympanicum. The rima glottidis was located in the floor of the gular sac at the level of C7 supported on the knobby remnant of the os entoglossum. There was no tongue.
10.2307/20094854|A male 19-yr-old western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) had an enlarged right testicle noted during a physical examination. Histopathological evaluation following surgical removal of the testicle revealed that the enlargement was because of a Leydig (interstitial) cell tumor.
10.2307/20094845|Results of the glutaraldehyde coagulation test and total serum protein levels were compared as a means of estimating serum gamma globulin levels in neonatal ruminants. Both tests were sensitive in detecting low immunoglobulin levels. Total serum protein was more useful because of its simplicity and quantitative nature when a variety of animal species were compared.
10.2307/20094873|A hemangiosarcoma with metastases to the spleen, liver, diaphragm, and kidneys was observed in a 12-yr-old captive cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). Hemangiosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor of endothelial cell origin. Although this tumor is infrequently reported in domestic felines, it has not been reported previously in exotic felines.
10.2307/20094869|Between January 1978 and December 1980, breeding females in a herd of blesbok antelope (Damiliscus dorcas phillipsi) displayed signs of copper (Cu) deficiency. Clinical indications included bleaching of the hair coat, abnormal hair quality, apparent weight loss, and anemia. During this time, two calves were born with progressive posterior ataxia. Blood serum Cu values were low (&lt0.1-0.4 g/ml) compared to healthy domestic ruminants (0.7-1.7 g/ml), although calculated dietary levels (16 mg/kg of dry matter, providing 50 mg Cu/animal/day) were considered adequate. Each blesbok was supplemented daily with 5 mg Cu as CuSO for 2 mo, for a total calculated Cu intake of 55 mg/day, but serum values did not change. An additional 5 mg Cu daily (60 mg/day) increased serum Cu to 1.2 g/ml (n = 4) within 2 mo, and signs of deficiency disappeared. Continued dietary supplementation at 60 mg Cu (approximately 20 mg/kg feed) since 1980 has maintained blood serum Cu in blesbok at 1.0  0.1 g/ml (n = 23).
10.2307/20094356|The interdisciplinary management of orofacial trauma in a lion cub, utilizing a polyethylene tubing chin support, as well as 8 month post-surgical observations, is presented.
10.2307/20094888|To synchronize estrus in red deer (Cervus elaphus), hinds were treated with: (1) two injections of prostaglandin
10.2307/20094843|Two white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawns and two domestic (alpine) goat (Capra hircus) kids were subjected to multiple anesthetic episodes at weekly intervals for the purpose of cerebrospinal fluid and blood collection. Anesthesia was induced by intramuscular injection of xylazine HCl (mean dosage 0.35 mg/kg, range 0.1-0.62 mg/kg) and ketamine HCl (mean dosage 2.92 mg/kg, range 1.65-6.2 mg/kg). Anesthesia was reversed by intravenous injection of tolazoline HCl (mean dosage 2.1 mg/kg, range 1.4-2.7 mg/kg). Antagonism of anesthesia with tolazoline resulted in the animals regaining sternal recumbency in mean times of &lt7 min postreversal. They regained ambulatory abilities in mean times of 10.9 and 16.8 min for the deer and the goats, respectively. Significant increases in the heart rates of all animals 2 min postreversal and significant differences in the respiratory rates postreversal were observed. A minimum of 12 successive episodes produced no clinical, serologic, or histopathologic evidence of drug-induced renal toxicity.
10.2307/20094865|The adequacy of ventilation during etorphine anesthesia of a 20-yr-old Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) was monitored with a pulse oximeter to measure arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO) and a CO analyzer to measure end-tidal CO concentrations (PetCO). Immediately after the first anesthetic induction, SaO values of 45% were noted while the animal was breathing room air at a rate of 6/min. The SaO readings increased to 93% 15 min after administration of 5 liters/min of oxygen via the trunk. Seven arterial blood gas samples obtained during two anesthetics, and once while unanesthetized, provided PaO and PaCO values, which compared favorably with SaO and PetCO. In the anesthetized animal, PaO ranged between 31 and 70 mm Hg while SaO values were 70-95%. At the same time, measurements of PaCO ranged from 42 to 57 mm Hg while values of PetCO ranged from 35 to 57 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry and end-tidal CO monitoring are easy to apply and should increase the safety of anesthesia for these animals.
10.2307/20460245|The kinetics of gentamicin in adult aquatic salamanders (Necturus necturus) were studied using two commercially available assays, a radioimmunoassay (Clinical Assays, Cambridge, Massachusetts) and an enzymatic immune assay (EMIT ASSAY, Syva Co., Palo Alto, California). Gentamicin serum levels did not reveal elimination characteristic of two compartments since the expected 4-5-hr-half-life alpha phase was obscured by an 8-hr distribution period to reach maximal serum levels. The gentamicin half-life during the presumed beta component for salamanders held between 2 and 3C was 32.5 hr based on the radioimmunoassay. In these studies the enzymatic immune assay gave serum gentamicin values consistently slightly higher than those found with the radioimmunoassay. This affected the estimated maximum serum concentration achieved, but did not appear to affect determination of the rates of redistribution. Either assay predicts that a therapeutic gentamicin dose schedule of 2.5 mg/kg given intramuscularly every 72 hr will maintain effective serum concentrations of gentamicin without producing levels greater than 12 g/ml for animals maintained at 3C.
10.2307/20094333|Twelve weaned aoudads were assigned to complete pelleted diets containing 13.1, 16.2 or 19.6% crude protein to explore their protein requirements for growth. Weights and blood samples were obtained at 6 and 12 weeks, and records of feed consumption were maintained. Blood measurements included hemoglobin concentration, packed red cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, plasma urea nitrogen, plasma -amino nitrogen, total plasma protein concentration, and plasma protein electrophoretic pattern. Average daily gains were not significantly affected by dietary protein level, and the only significant dietary effect on blood parameters was on plasma urea nitrogen. This value was elevated on 19.6% dietary protein at 6 and 12 weeks and on 16.2% dietary protein at 6 weeks, and indicates that the exogenous protein supply on these diets may be in excess of needs. These data suggest that the dietary protein requirement for weaned aoudads, under the conditions of this study, does not exceed 13.1% and levels up to 19.6% do not appear to be harmful.
10.2307/20094842|Sixteen African elephants (Loxodonta africana) were immobilized with single i.m. injections of carfentanil citrate (2.1  0.3 g/kg body weight). All elephants were laterally recumbent in 10.1  3.7 min. An additional elephant which received 1.4 g/kg carfentanil did not become recumbent and additional carfentanil was required for immobilization. Following immobilization, nine elephants were maintained in lateral recumbency by administration of multiple i.v. injections of carfentanil, one elephant received a single i.v. dose of ketamine hydrochloride, and four were intubated and administered 1-1.5% halothane in oxygen. Because a short duration of immobilization was desired, three elephants were not given additional drugs. The duration of immobilization ranged from 4 to 187 min. Following a variety of medical and surgical procedures, 13 elephants received nalmefene hydrochloride, two elephants received diprenorphine, and two elephants received both diprenorphine and nalmefene; antagonists were administered either i.v. and i.m. or i.v. and s.c. Sixteen of 17 elephants were standing in 2.9  1.4 min; the standing time of one elephant was not recorded.
10.2307/20094851|In September 1987, a 22-yr-old female killer whale (Orcinus orca) developed a raised, soft, fluctuant vesicle involving the dorsolateral surface of the tongue. The whale had an uneventful past health history and had been vaccinated with a killed erysipelas bacterin annually from 1971 to 1977. While the whale exhibited minor discomfort to palpation of this vesicle, food intake and overall behavioral attitude remained normal. Hematologic and blood chemical parameters were within normal established ranges for this whale. A bacterial culture from the closed vesicle demonstrated a pure culture of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. The whale was placed on a 10-day course of 20 g cefadroxil b.i.d. in the daily food ration. During antibiotic therapy for this atypical erysipelas infection, the vesicle slowly enlarged with ultimate rupture and ulceration. Complete uneventful resolution of this condition occurred in approximately 28 days, at which time the whale had a positive serum microtitration agglutination titer for E. rhusiopathiae.
10.2307/20460244|Fourteen lesser galagos (Galago senegalensis, family Lorisidae) were anesthetized for dental prophylaxis and physical examinations. While under anesthesia, prior to the dental work, electrocardiograms (ECG's) were performed. These ECG's were analyzed and normal intervals, deflections, and axes were determined.
10.2307/20094848|A clinical trial comparing the efficacy of injectable invermectin and topical amitraz on chorioptic acariasis in a zoo colony of African hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris) is described. A single treatment with a 0.03% rinse of amitraz reduced mite numbers, and a second treatment, 7 days later, appeared to clear the infestation. Intramuscular injection of 200 g/kg ivermectin at both 14- and 21-day intervals was ineffective in eliminating the mites. No untoward reaction to either drug was noted. The mechanism of actions and toxicities of ivermectin and amitraz are briefly discussed. Amitraz may be a useful primary agent for control of chorioptic mites in African hedgehogs.
10.2307/20094886|Twenty-four juvenile American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), allotted into four groups, were given gentamicin sulfate at dosages of 1.25 mg/kg of body weight (Group 1) or 1.75 mg/kg (Group 2), or amikacin sulfate at 1.75 mg/kg (Group 3) or 2.25 mg/kg (Group 4). Gentamicin was administered by a single i.m. injection and amikacin was administered twice by i.m. injections, 96 hr apart. Serum concentrations of gentamicin and amikacin were measured in serial samples collected for 96-hr and 102-hr periods, respectively. The mean peak serum concentration of gentamicin in Group 1 alligators was 6.2 g/ml at 0.5 hr postinjection; thereafter, the mean serum concentration decreased to 0.6 g/ml by 96 hr postinjection. The mean peak serum concentration of gentamicin in Group 2 alligators was 9.5 g/ml at 1 hr after injection; thereafter, the mean serum concentration decreased to 2.7 g/ml by 96 hr after injection. The mean peak serum concentration of amikacin in Group 3 alligators was 10.9 g/ml at 1 hr after injection; thereafter, the mean serum concentration decreased to 1.9 g/ml by 96 hr after injection. After a second injection of amikacin at 96 hr, mean serum concentration increased to 13.2 g/ml by 97 hr postinjection. The mean peak serum concentration of amikacin in Group 4 alligators was 14.5 g/ml at 0.5 hr after injection; thereafter, mean serum concentration decreased to 2.6 g/ml by 96 hr. After a second injection of amikacin at 96 hr postinjection, mean serum concentration increased to 22.3 g/ml within 30 min.
10.2307/20094846|The effect of dietary protein concentration on hoof growth of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was studied by feeding diets containing 7.9 or 16.8% crude protein, dry basis, to 12 6-7-mo-old does from 15 December 1986 to 26 May 1987. Average daily hoof growth for the entire study was slightly, but not significantly (P &gt 0.10), slower for does fed the low-protein diet. For the period from 4 March to 14 April, hoof growth was significantly different between treatments, but this difference disappeared from 15 April to 26 May. Lower body weights were observed by the end of the study in does fed the low-protein diet, and this difference approached significance (P &lt 0.09). However, toe lengths were unaffected by treatment. Thus, diets containing 7.9% crude protein, when fed to juvenile white-tailed deer, do not appear to reduce the rate of hoof growth and may be unsuitable for young deer because of potential retardation of body growth.
10.2307/20094870|A 4-5-yr-old, 250-kg, female African elephant (Loxodonta africana africana) was examined because of chronic, intermittent diarrhea and poor weight gain. Abnormal clinical findings were cachexia, diarrhea, and ventral edema. Significant laboratory findings included low serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations, sporadic hyperbilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia, intermittent hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, sporadic leukocytosis, neutrophilia/neutropenia, and lymphocytosis. The elephant had d-xylose malabsorption, and lymphocyte aggregates were found in histological sections of rectal biopsies. Recurrent dental disease might have accounted for some of the clinical findings including cachexia. Although an extensive workup was done, the cause or causes of the diarrhea were not determined and the condition spontaneously resolved.
10.2307/20094885|Retroviruses of the subfamilies Oncovirinae (type C and D viruses), Lentivirinae (type E or lentiviruses), and Spumavirinae (type F, foamy, or syncytial viruses) have been isolated from nonhuman primates. These viruses have similar genetic organization, but differ morphologically. Type C viruses include several endogenous viruses and the exogenous simian sarcoma virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, and the simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLV) that are closely related to the human T-cell leukemia virus, HTLV-1. Primate type D viruses include endogenous viruses from squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and langurs (Presbytis spp.) and the exogenous simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) retroviruses (SRV) that are found nearly exclusively in the genus Macaca. The SRV's cause profound immune deficiency in both naturally infected and experimentally inoculated macaques. The known primate lentiviruses are the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) that naturally infect primates of the genera Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, Papio, and Miopithecus without causing disease. In macaques, the relatively infrequent natural SIV infections or experimental inoculations are associated with severe immune deficiency. Methods commonly used to detect exogenous retrovirus infections include serology by ELISA, immunofluorescence, RIP-PAGE, Western blotting, and virus isolation by cocultivation of monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells with other sensitive cells. Infected animals have been found in zoos, vivaria, and the wild. Precautions adequate for protection against known primate pathogens should protect humans against any as yet unknown zoonotic potential.
10.2307/20094868|Thirty-four brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) with lacerated gular sacs were submitted for examination and medical treatment. The gular sac was described histologically, and an effective suture method was employed. The edges of the wounds were trimmed back to clean tissue, and internal and external surfaces were separated by about 2 mm in order to approximate the skeletal muscle central layer and individually suture both surfaces. The debrided surface was placed next to the corresponding debrided surface and sutured with simple interrupted 4/0 nylon sutures every 3 mm.
10.2307/20094874|Endoscopic examination of a 23-yr-old lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) with a history of dysphagia, periodic vomiting, and lethargy revealed a large esophageal mass proximal to the cardia. The gorilla later developed severe inhalation pneumonia and was euthanized. Histological examination of the mass identified it as a leiomyoma.
10.2307/20460142|A discussion of anesthetic agents and techniques used in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) is presented. Special consideration was given to the selection and administration of the agents based upon the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the particular species of seal being studied. Phencyclidine hydrochloride, ketamine hydrochloride, and tiletamine hydrochloride were administered intramuscularly. Other drugs tested were thiamylal sodium, gallamine triethiodide, succinlycholine chloride, tubocurarine chloride, nitrous oxide and halothane.
10.2307/20094852|Salmonella blockley was isolated from an Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) with intestinal lesions in Malaysia. A second elephant that died with similar lesions also was suspected to have Salmonella sp. This is the first case of salmonellosis in an Asian elephant from Malaysia.
10.2307/20460246|A Neisseria species was isolated from septicemic, abscessed, and healthy iguanid lizards at the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., between August 1984 and November 1985. Neisseria septicemia caused the death of one rhinoceros iguana in 1984. Of seven common iguanas, four had chronic, recurrent tail abscesses from which a Neisseria species was isolated in 3 cases. Microscopically, all four iguanas with tail lesions had colonies of gram-negative diplococci surrounded by a Splendore-Hoeppli reaction. A Clostridium species was cultured from the tail abscess of the fourth iguana and recovered initially from another affected iguana that later yielded Neisseria; Clostridium was considered to be a wound contaminant. The mouths of the living rhinoceros iguanas and of both healthy and abscessed common iguanas were cultured, and 50% were found to be oral carriers of Neisseria. All isolates of Neisseria were the same species, but did not correspond to any currently described species. Common iguanas were successfully treated by tail amputation, but debridement followed by local and parenteral antibiotic therapy was associated with delayed healing and incomplete resolution of the lesions.
10.2307/20094856|An interstitial cell tumor is reported in a California desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizi). This case is unusual because testicular tumors have rarely been reported in reptiles.
10.2307/20460158|A brief summary of chemical immobilization of moose in North America is made. This looks at the various methods of approach, the weapons used and the drugs used. Most of the data available on successful moose capture refers to either succinylcholine chloride or etorphine hydrochloride. Preliminary results on a combination of fentanyl citrate and xylazine hydrochloride used for the immobilization of 47 moose are given. The animals were darted from a helicopter with Cap-Chur projectile syringes fired from the extra long-range projector. A dosage between 0.14 mg and 0.53 mg/kg of fentanyl and 0.15 to 0.53 mg/kg of xylazine provided satisfactory Immobilization. Hyaluronidase was added to the mixture on 24 occasions. This had the effect of reducing the induction time between 36 and 45%. The injection site was also found to affect the speed of induction, injections over the heavy muscle masses of shoulder and hind limb producing more rapid immobilization than in other sites. A major factor in successful moose capture from a helicopter was the experience, or lack thereof, of the pilot in this type of work.
10.2307/20094891|Squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea was diagnosed in an adult female cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). No cases have previously been diagnosed in a nondomestic felid. Because diffuse infiltration of the tumor was suspected, an exenteration of the left orbit was performed. Postoperative complications included bleeding from the incision site and inability to administer medicants orally because of inappetence. By postoperative day 4, the cheetah started eating and subsequently recovered uneventfully.
10.2307/20094493|Hematology and serum chemistry profiles for giraffes are presented. Values for 39 blood samples, collected from 14 giraffes, were analyzed and evaluated for variations relating to differences in sex, age, and restraint mode. Sex-specific variations were found in WBC and neutrophil numbers, total protein, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Age-specific variations were found in hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocytes, banded neutrophil and basophil numbers, and in calcium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine concentrations. Variations relating to differences in restraint mode used to collect the blood samples were found in calcium and uric acid concentrations.
10.2307/20094890|A 23-yr-old, male Sumatran orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus abelii) died suddenly and at necropsy had peritoneal and pericardial effusions, cardiac dilatation with a pale mottled myocardium, and pulmonary edema and congestion. There was subacute interstitial myocarditis with extensive involvement of the conduction system. Encephalomyocarditis virus was isolated in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells from a suspension of the affected myocardium.
20460133|Serial blood chemistry (Ca,P, BUN, uric acid, cholesterol, bilirubin, alkaline phosphotase, LDH, SGOT, TP, albumin, globulin, alpha 1 globulin, alpha 2 globulin, beta globulin, gamma globulin, (Ca:P and A:G) and hematology values (PCV and Hb) with excitability and condition classes were obtained from 5 adult wild female moose, 4 adult wild male moose, 1 tame adult female mooise, and 1 semi-tame adult castrated male moose from May, 1972 to January, 1975 at the Kenai Moose Research Center, Alaska. Condition related blood criteria based upon population sampling (PCV, Hb, Ca, P, TP, glucose, albumin, and beta globulin) were compared with individual serial sampled moose and, and in general, they reflected condition classes which corresponded to seaasons (lower values in late winter-spring and higher values in fall). Exceptions to this were noted. Blood urea nitrogen levels reflected seasonal variability in protein intake. Lactic dehydrogenase and SGOT values did not correspond to excitability classes as was anticipated. These data demonstrated some expected trends based upon population blood studies; however, they also indicated that individual variability influenced blood values and inferred population criteria must be based upon adequate sampling. Other parameters presented which were not specificall discussed may provide useful comparative data for other purposes and are presented for that reason.
10.2307/20094875|Dysgerminomas were observed in two red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), representing the first report of this neoplasm in reptiles. Although the turtles shared the same environment, they were unrelated and the etiology of this tumor in these two turtles is not known.
10.2307/20094889|Of the four most common techniques used to capture desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), net-gun capture generally causes fewer and lower-level stress-mediated shifts in physiological and biochemical parameters, the lowest mortality rate, and the lowest combined morbidity and mortality rate. Only one of 137 (0.7%) bighorn sheep net-gun captured between 1983 and 1986 showed signs of capture myopathy, and two (1.5%) died of injuries. Although net-gunning was found to be the safest method for capturing bighorn sheep, it does pose some serious hazards to the human user. Accidental discharge of the net-gun inside the helicopter, toward the main or rear rotor, or onto the skid can cause the helicopter to crash. Cost of net-gunning compared favorably with other methods of capture when the initial investment was amortized over 20 or more animals. An additional cost consideration is the versatility of the net-gun, as it can be used to capture several large mammals and birds.
10.2307/20460252|The hearts of a full-term fetus and an adult Indian one horned rhinoceros were studied. Although the gross anatomical features of the rhino heart generally resembled those of the hearts of the elephant, Asiatic buffalo, goat, and other domestic animals, there were differences in the biometrics.
10.2307/20094895|Two captive sloths (Cholepus sp.) developed cystic calculi, one resulting in a rectal prolapse secondary to stranguria. Both animals underwent cystotomy and systemic antibiotic therapy, and their dietary protein level was reduced. No medical problems related to these conditions have developed since the sloths were treated and their diet modified.
10.2307/20094894|An 18-yr-old male tiger died of massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage from a retroperitoneal paraganglioma. Incidental finding was a renal cystadenoma.
10.2307/20094872|A captive-raised snow leopard (Panthera uncia) was found to have mandibular osteomyelitis. Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the infection site. Surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy with cefadroxil were used to successfully treat the infection. A mandibular fracture and canine and premolar tooth abscesses developed postoperatively and delayed recovery.
10.2307/20094849|Seventeen cases of Actinomyces pyogenes infections occurred in six species of captive Bovidae and Cervidae from 1978 to 1986. Infected animals included two yellow-backed duikers (Cephalophus sylvicultor), one white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus albojubatus), one scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), eight dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas), three Reeve's muntjacs (Muntiacus reevesi), and two reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Actinomyces pyogenes was isolated exclusively from external abscesses (mandible, hoof, and other cutaneous sites) in 12 animals and from urine, blood, and abscesses of the kidneys, lungs, and liver in five animals.
10.2307/20094892|A female snow leopard (Panthera uncia) underwent surgical removal of a 1.025-kg ovarian mass determined histologically to be a dysgerminoma. This is the second report of a primordial germ cell tumor in a snow leopard.
10.2307/20094887|Epididymal spermatozoa were harvested from a gaur (Bos gaurus) bull that had been euthanized 27 hr previously. The testes and attached epididymides were sent to the Cryogenics Laboratory, Iowa State University. Spermatozoa were removed from the distal portion of both ductus deferentia and cauda epididymides. Following equilibration in an egg yolk-buffer extender, the spermatozoa were packaged in straws, frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Postthaw analysis of motility indicated a significant degree of spermatozoal survival. A Holstein cow in estrus was inseminated twice with 80  10 spermatozoa to test the ability of the spermatozoa to undergo capacitation, zona penetration, membrane fusion, embryogenesis, and placentation. Pregnancy was verified by ultrasound 41 days postinsemination.
10.2307/20094896|A long-term captive Peruvian red-tail boa constrictor (Boa constrictor ortoni) exhibited anorexia and weight loss prior to sudden death. An undifferentiated carcinoma with characteristics of a granulosa cell tumor was identified. Metastasis was manifested as nodules embedded in paraovarian mesentery and the surface of the liver. The popularity of boa constrictors as zoological display animals and relative scarcity of ovarian neoplasms in snakes warrants reporting of the case.
10.2307/20460239|A study was undertaken at Edinburgh Zoo to investigate gastrointestinal nematodiasis in blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) involving Camelostrongylus mentulatus and to a lesser extent Nematodirus spathiger. Camelostrongylus mentulatus was associated with chronic emaciation and the death of a subdominant adult male animal following fighting. It was found to overwinter as infective larvae on pasture, and circumstantial evidence suggests that it may also do so as adults and arrested larvae within the blackbuck. Control was not achieved until anthelmintics were given monthly from June onward. This regime successfully reduced fecal egg counts and pasture larvae of C. mentulatus, but numbers of N. spathiger larvae on pasture were unaffected and reached a peak in mid-August. The possible factors involved in this infection and their impact on neonatal viability are briefly discussed.
10.2307/20094866|Serum levels of gentamicin were measured at various times in juvenile Markhor goats (Capra falconeri) following intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) dosing at 5 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the time-concentration curves obtained. For the i.v. administration route, the data were best modelled by a biexponential curve. The first phase (distribution) and the second phase (elimination) half-lives averaged (SEM) 29  5 min and 1.9  0.2 hr, respectively. The steady-state volume of distribution (
10.2307/20094884|Enactment of animal welfare legislation and the characteristics these laws have taken parallel the evolution of the animal welfare and humane movement. As we move into the 21st century, zoological collections, wildlife management activities, and the entire spectrum of captive animal management will be challenged to meet new standards.
10.2307/20094864|Medetomidine- and ketamine-induced immobilization were studied clinically and by serial evaluations and determinations in 18 captive Markhors (Capra falconeri megaceros) on 21 occasions. Medetomidine and ketamine induced reliable immobilization with good muscle relaxation at mean doses of 69.0 g/kg and 1.60 mg/kg, respectively. In six Markhors, serial recordings and determinations were done at 10, 30, 45, and 60 min after darting. During the immobilization period, most clinical, hematological, and serum chemistry parameters remained within physiological limits, although there were statistically significant decreases in heart rates, rectal temperatures, packed cell volumes, and in serum aspartate aminotransferase, Na, Cl, and Ca levels. Significant increases in glucose levels were detected in EDTA blood and serum samples. Respiratory rates, leukocyte counts, and serum creatine kinase, urea, K, and inorganic phosphate levels remained stable. Atipamezole given by i.v., i.m., and i.v. +i.m. injections (mean doses 296.7, 323.0, and 287.7 g/kg, respectively) was used to reverse the medetomidine- and ketamine-induced immobilization. Atipamezole induced rapid, calm, and persistent reversal in most animals. Markhors were able to walk in a directed manner within 1-7 min.
10.2307/20094893|An adult female tiger (Panthera tigris) was euthanized for a widely metastatic complex mammary carcinoma. Gross metastases were found in the lungs, liver, spleen, diaphragm, adrenals, and in regional, thoracic, and abdominal lymph nodes. Microscopic metastases were found in ovaries, wall of the uterus, pancreas, a renal glomerulus, and periaortic lymphatics. The tumor consisted of myoepithelial cells and adenocarcinomatous cells with squamous metaplasia. The metastases showed regional predominance of distinct cytological patterns. Uterine mucosal hyperplasia was probably the result of progestagens administered for estrus control.
10.2307/20460169|Mycoplasma sp. and Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis were isolated in large numbers from joint fluid and blood in a 4-week-old barn owl (Tyto alba) which developed soft tissue swellings caused by trauma of talon implants from sibling owls. The wounds resulted in osteomyelitis of several long bones. The bird died three days after clinical signs were detected.
10.2307/20460173|Excision orthoplasty consisting of left femoral head and neck ostectomy was performed on an adult female Giant anteater, Myrmecophaga tridactyla, due to chronic bilateral degenerative joint disease of the coxofemoral joints. Surgery was performed following chronic rear leg lameness, gradual weight loss and general decreased function and activity of the animal over a period of several years. A severely affected joint was disclosed and the surgery consisted of a successful salvage procedure following the anteater's anesthetic recovery, a steady weight gain and a return to moderate function of the operated limb over a period of several weeks.
10.2307/20094850|A 10-yr-old male Jimela topi (Damaliscus lunatus jimela) born in captivity was evaluated by Veterinary Services, San Diego Zoo. The animal had a history of weight loss in the presence of a good appetite, abdominal distension, and intermittent soft feces. Clinical evaluation revealed a marginal anemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, a lymphocyte-neutrophil reversal, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Radiographs, per rectal colonic biopsy, comparative intradermal tuberculin skin tests, and attempts to isolate Salmonella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were all negative. Fecal smears revealed abundant acid-fast bacilli. A diagnosis of Johne's disease was made and the animal was euthanized. Necropsy revealed an emaciated animal with a mildly thickened and hyperemic small intestine, cecum, and large intestine; lymphadenopathy of the colonic, intestinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes; and a mottled, soft friable liver. Histopathologic evaluation revealed chronic diffuse granulomatous inflammatory infiltrates in the small and large intestine, intra-abdominal lymph nodes, and hepatic peripheral lobular regions. There were abundant macrophages in all these tissues which contained large numbers of densely packed intracytoplasmic acid-fast bacilli. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis was isolated from the fecal cultures. Because of the potential transmission of Johne's disease to two adult female and three juvenile topi cohabiting with the infected animal, all herd mates were euthanized. Serologic, comparative skin tests, histopathologic evaluation, and fecal examination failed to indicate the presence of mycobacterial organisms or disease in any of these animals.
10.2307/20094867|Fourteen brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) were injected with radiopaque silicone rubber in the left carotid artery at the level of C4, radiographed, and dissected to study the vascular anatomy of the head and gular sac. The main blood supply to the head was the left carotid artery, supplying right and left internal carotids. Branches from these vessels ran parallel with branches of the cranial cephalic veins. Bilaterally, two pairs of these vessels traveled on each side of the hyoid bone and met in the midline as four pairs of vessels coursing down the gular sac sending branches laterally. One pair of mandibular branches of arteries and veins traveled under each mandibular ramus and sent branches medially into the gular sac. Anastomoses between the mandibular and central gular supply were not observed. The gular sac was multilayered, with inner and outer epithelial layers covering a highly vascular, muscular layer. The outer epithelial layer covered a subepithelial melanocyte layer. Respiratory openings included a slitlike opening on the roof of the oral cavity, the choana, and a short rima infundibulum caudal to the choana connecting the pharynx to the infundibulum pharyngotympanicum. The rima glottidis was located in the floor of the gular sac at the level of C7 supported on the knobby remnant of the os entoglossum. There was no tongue.
10.2307/20094854|A male 19-yr-old western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) had an enlarged right testicle noted during a physical examination. Histopathological evaluation following surgical removal of the testicle revealed that the enlargement was because of a Leydig (interstitial) cell tumor.
10.2307/20094845|Results of the glutaraldehyde coagulation test and total serum protein levels were compared as a means of estimating serum gamma globulin levels in neonatal ruminants. Both tests were sensitive in detecting low immunoglobulin levels. Total serum protein was more useful because of its simplicity and quantitative nature when a variety of animal species were compared.
10.2307/20094873|A hemangiosarcoma with metastases to the spleen, liver, diaphragm, and kidneys was observed in a 12-yr-old captive cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). Hemangiosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor of endothelial cell origin. Although this tumor is infrequently reported in domestic felines, it has not been reported previously in exotic felines.
10.2307/20094869|Between January 1978 and December 1980, breeding females in a herd of blesbok antelope (Damiliscus dorcas phillipsi) displayed signs of copper (Cu) deficiency. Clinical indications included bleaching of the hair coat, abnormal hair quality, apparent weight loss, and anemia. During this time, two calves were born with progressive posterior ataxia. Blood serum Cu values were low (&lt0.1-0.4 g/ml) compared to healthy domestic ruminants (0.7-1.7 g/ml), although calculated dietary levels (16 mg/kg of dry matter, providing 50 mg Cu/animal/day) were considered adequate. Each blesbok was supplemented daily with 5 mg Cu as CuSO for 2 mo, for a total calculated Cu intake of 55 mg/day, but serum values did not change. An additional 5 mg Cu daily (60 mg/day) increased serum Cu to 1.2 g/ml (n = 4) within 2 mo, and signs of deficiency disappeared. Continued dietary supplementation at 60 mg Cu (approximately 20 mg/kg feed) since 1980 has maintained blood serum Cu in blesbok at 1.0  0.1 g/ml (n = 23).

10.2307/20094888|To synchronize estrus in red deer (Cervus elaphus), hinds were treated with: (1) two injections of prostaglandin
10.2307/20094843|Two white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawns and two domestic (alpine) goat (Capra hircus) kids were subjected to multiple anesthetic episodes at weekly intervals for the purpose of cerebrospinal fluid and blood collection. Anesthesia was induced by intramuscular injection of xylazine HCl (mean dosage 0.35 mg/kg, range 0.1-0.62 mg/kg) and ketamine HCl (mean dosage 2.92 mg/kg, range 1.65-6.2 mg/kg). Anesthesia was reversed by intravenous injection of tolazoline HCl (mean dosage 2.1 mg/kg, range 1.4-2.7 mg/kg). Antagonism of anesthesia with tolazoline resulted in the animals regaining sternal recumbency in mean times of &lt7 min postreversal. They regained ambulatory abilities in mean times of 10.9 and 16.8 min for the deer and the goats, respectively. Significant increases in the heart rates of all animals 2 min postreversal and significant differences in the respiratory rates postreversal were observed. A minimum of 12 successive episodes produced no clinical, serologic, or histopathologic evidence of drug-induced renal toxicity.
10.2307/20094865|The adequacy of ventilation during etorphine anesthesia of a 20-yr-old Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) was monitored with a pulse oximeter to measure arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO) and a CO analyzer to measure end-tidal CO concentrations (PetCO). Immediately after the first anesthetic induction, SaO values of 45% were noted while the animal was breathing room air at a rate of 6/min. The SaO readings increased to 93% 15 min after administration of 5 liters/min of oxygen via the trunk. Seven arterial blood gas samples obtained during two anesthetics, and once while unanesthetized, provided PaO and PaCO values, which compared favorably with SaO and PetCO. In the anesthetized animal, PaO ranged between 31 and 70 mm Hg while SaO values were 70-95%. At the same time, measurements of PaCO ranged from 42 to 57 mm Hg while values of PetCO ranged from 35 to 57 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry and end-tidal CO monitoring are easy to apply and should increase the safety of anesthesia for these animals.
10.2307/20460245|The kinetics of gentamicin in adult aquatic salamanders (Necturus necturus) were studied using two commercially available assays, a radioimmunoassay (Clinical Assays, Cambridge, Massachusetts) and an enzymatic immune assay (EMIT ASSAY, Syva Co., Palo Alto, California). Gentamicin serum levels did not reveal elimination characteristic of two compartments since the expected 4-5-hr-half-life alpha phase was obscured by an 8-hr distribution period to reach maximal serum levels. The gentamicin half-life during the presumed beta component for salamanders held between 2 and 3C was 32.5 hr based on the radioimmunoassay. In these studies the enzymatic immune assay gave serum gentamicin values consistently slightly higher than those found with the radioimmunoassay. This affected the estimated maximum serum concentration achieved, but did not appear to affect determination of the rates of redistribution. Either assay predicts that a therapeutic gentamicin dose schedule of 2.5 mg/kg given intramuscularly every 72 hr will maintain effective serum concentrations of gentamicin without producing levels greater than 12 g/ml for animals maintained at 3C.
10.2307/20094333|Twelve weaned aoudads were assigned to complete pelleted diets containing 13.1, 16.2 or 19.6% crude protein to explore their protein requirements for growth. Weights and blood samples were obtained at 6 and 12 weeks, and records of feed consumption were maintained. Blood measurements included hemoglobin concentration, packed red cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, plasma urea nitrogen, plasma -amino nitrogen, total plasma protein concentration, and plasma protein electrophoretic pattern. Average daily gains were not significantly affected by dietary protein level, and the only significant dietary effect on blood parameters was on plasma urea nitrogen. This value was elevated on 19.6% dietary protein at 6 and 12 weeks and on 16.2% dietary protein at 6 weeks, and indicates that the exogenous protein supply on these diets may be in excess of needs. These data suggest that the dietary protein requirement for weaned aoudads, under the conditions of this study, does not exceed 13.1% and levels up to 19.6% do not appear to be harmful.
10.2307/20094842|Sixteen African elephants (Loxodonta africana) were immobilized with single i.m. injections of carfentanil citrate (2.1  0.3 g/kg body weight). All elephants were laterally recumbent in 10.1  3.7 min. An additional elephant which received 1.4 g/kg carfentanil did not become recumbent and additional carfentanil was required for immobilization. Following immobilization, nine elephants were maintained in lateral recumbency by administration of multiple i.v. injections of carfentanil, one elephant received a single i.v. dose of ketamine hydrochloride, and four were intubated and administered 1-1.5% halothane in oxygen. Because a short duration of immobilization was desired, three elephants were not given additional drugs. The duration of immobilization ranged from 4 to 187 min. Following a variety of medical and surgical procedures, 13 elephants received nalmefene hydrochloride, two elephants received diprenorphine, and two elephants received both diprenorphine and nalmefene; antagonists were administered either i.v. and i.m. or i.v. and s.c. Sixteen of 17 elephants were standing in 2.9  1.4 min; the standing time of one elephant was not recorded.
10.2307/20094851|In September 1987, a 22-yr-old female killer whale (Orcinus orca) developed a raised, soft, fluctuant vesicle involving the dorsolateral surface of the tongue. The whale had an uneventful past health history and had been vaccinated with a killed erysipelas bacterin annually from 1971 to 1977. While the whale exhibited minor discomfort to palpation of this vesicle, food intake and overall behavioral attitude remained normal. Hematologic and blood chemical parameters were within normal established ranges for this whale. A bacterial culture from the closed vesicle demonstrated a pure culture of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. The whale was placed on a 10-day course of 20 g cefadroxil b.i.d. in the daily food ration. During antibiotic therapy for this atypical erysipelas infection, the vesicle slowly enlarged with ultimate rupture and ulceration. Complete uneventful resolution of this condition occurred in approximately 28 days, at which time the whale had a positive serum microtitration agglutination titer for E. rhusiopathiae.
10.2307/20460244|Fourteen lesser galagos (Galago senegalensis, family Lorisidae) were anesthetized for dental prophylaxis and physical examinations. While under anesthesia, prior to the dental work, electrocardiograms (ECG's) were performed. These ECG's were analyzed and normal intervals, deflections, and axes were determined.
10.2307/20094848|A clinical trial comparing the efficacy of injectable invermectin and topical amitraz on chorioptic acariasis in a zoo colony of African hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris) is described. A single treatment with a 0.03% rinse of amitraz reduced mite numbers, and a second treatment, 7 days later, appeared to clear the infestation. Intramuscular injection of 200 g/kg ivermectin at both 14- and 21-day intervals was ineffective in eliminating the mites. No untoward reaction to either drug was noted. The mechanism of actions and toxicities of ivermectin and amitraz are briefly discussed. Amitraz may be a useful primary agent for control of chorioptic mites in African hedgehogs.
10.2307/20094886|Twenty-four juvenile American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), allotted into four groups, were given gentamicin sulfate at dosages of 1.25 mg/kg of body weight (Group 1) or 1.75 mg/kg (Group 2), or amikacin sulfate at 1.75 mg/kg (Group 3) or 2.25 mg/kg (Group 4). Gentamicin was administered by a single i.m. injection and amikacin was administered twice by i.m. injections, 96 hr apart. Serum concentrations of gentamicin and amikacin were measured in serial samples collected for 96-hr and 102-hr periods, respectively. The mean peak serum concentration of gentamicin in Group 1 alligators was 6.2 g/ml at 0.5 hr postinjection; thereafter, the mean serum concentration decreased to 0.6 g/ml by 96 hr postinjection. The mean peak serum concentration of gentamicin in Group 2 alligators was 9.5 g/ml at 1 hr after injection; thereafter, the mean serum concentration decreased to 2.7 g/ml by 96 hr after injection. The mean peak serum concentration of amikacin in Group 3 alligators was 10.9 g/ml at 1 hr after injection; thereafter, the mean serum concentration decreased to 1.9 g/ml by 96 hr after injection. After a second injection of amikacin at 96 hr, mean serum concentration increased to 13.2 g/ml by 97 hr postinjection. The mean peak serum concentration of amikacin in Group 4 alligators was 14.5 g/ml at 0.5 hr after injection; thereafter, mean serum concentration decreased to 2.6 g/ml by 96 hr. After a second injection of amikacin at 96 hr postinjection, mean serum concentration increased to 22.3 g/ml within 30 min.
10.2307/20094846|The effect of dietary protein concentration on hoof growth of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was studied by feeding diets containing 7.9 or 16.8% crude protein, dry basis, to 12 6-7-mo-old does from 15 December 1986 to 26 May 1987. Average daily hoof growth for the entire study was slightly, but not significantly (P &gt 0.10), slower for does fed the low-protein diet. For the period from 4 March to 14 April, hoof growth was significantly different between treatments, but this difference disappeared from 15 April to 26 May. Lower body weights were observed by the end of the study in does fed the low-protein diet, and this difference approached significance (P &lt 0.09). However, toe lengths were unaffected by treatment. Thus, diets containing 7.9% crude protein, when fed to juvenile white-tailed deer, do not appear to reduce the rate of hoof growth and may be unsuitable for young deer because of potential retardation of body growth.
10.2307/20094870|A 4-5-yr-old, 250-kg, female African elephant (Loxodonta africana africana) was examined because of chronic, intermittent diarrhea and poor weight gain. Abnormal clinical findings were cachexia, diarrhea, and ventral edema. Significant laboratory findings included low serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations, sporadic hyperbilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia, intermittent hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, sporadic leukocytosis, neutrophilia/neutropenia, and lymphocytosis. The elephant had d-xylose malabsorption, and lymphocyte aggregates were found in histological sections of rectal biopsies. Recurrent dental disease might have accounted for some of the clinical findings including cachexia. Although an extensive workup was done, the cause or causes of the diarrhea were not determined and the condition spontaneously resolved.
10.2307/20094885|Retroviruses of the subfamilies Oncovirinae (type C and D viruses), Lentivirinae (type E or lentiviruses), and Spumavirinae (type F, foamy, or syncytial viruses) have been isolated from nonhuman primates. These viruses have similar genetic organization, but differ morphologically. Type C viruses include several endogenous viruses and the exogenous simian sarcoma virus, gibbon ape leukemia virus, and the simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLV) that are closely related to the human T-cell leukemia virus, HTLV-1. Primate type D viruses include endogenous viruses from squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and langurs (Presbytis spp.) and the exogenous simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) retroviruses (SRV) that are found nearly exclusively in the genus Macaca. The SRV's cause profound immune deficiency in both naturally infected and experimentally inoculated macaques. The known primate lentiviruses are the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) that naturally infect primates of the genera Cercocebus, Cercopithecus, Papio, and Miopithecus without causing disease. In macaques, the relatively infrequent natural SIV infections or experimental inoculations are associated with severe immune deficiency. Methods commonly used to detect exogenous retrovirus infections include serology by ELISA, immunofluorescence, RIP-PAGE, Western blotting, and virus isolation by cocultivation of monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells with other sensitive cells. Infected animals have been found in zoos, vivaria, and the wild. Precautions adequate for protection against known primate pathogens should protect humans against any as yet unknown zoonotic potential.
10.2307/20094868|Thirty-four brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) with lacerated gular sacs were submitted for examination and medical treatment. The gular sac was described histologically, and an effective suture method was employed. The edges of the wounds were trimmed back to clean tissue, and internal and external surfaces were separated by about 2 mm in order to approximate the skeletal muscle central layer and individually suture both surfaces. The debrided surface was placed next to the corresponding debrided surface and sutured with simple interrupted 4/0 nylon sutures every 3 mm.
10.2307/20094874|Endoscopic examination of a 23-yr-old lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) with a history of dysphagia, periodic vomiting, and lethargy revealed a large esophageal mass proximal to the cardia. The gorilla later developed severe inhalation pneumonia and was euthanized. Histological examination of the mass identified it as a leiomyoma.
10.2307/20460142|A discussion of anesthetic agents and techniques used in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) is presented. Special consideration was given to the selection and administration of the agents based upon the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the particular species of seal being studied. Phencyclidine hydrochloride, ketamine hydrochloride, and tiletamine hydrochloride were administered intramuscularly. Other drugs tested were thiamylal sodium, gallamine triethiodide, succinlycholine chloride, tubocurarine chloride, nitrous oxide and halothane.
10.2307/20094852|Salmonella blockley was isolated from an Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) with intestinal lesions in Malaysia. A second elephant that died with similar lesions also was suspected to have Salmonella sp. This is the first case of salmonellosis in an Asian elephant from Malaysia.
10.2307/20460246|A Neisseria species was isolated from septicemic, abscessed, and healthy iguanid lizards at the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., between August 1984 and November 1985. Neisseria septicemia caused the death of one rhinoceros iguana in 1984. Of seven common iguanas, four had chronic, recurrent tail abscesses from which a Neisseria species was isolated in 3 cases. Microscopically, all four iguanas with tail lesions had colonies of gram-negative diplococci surrounded by a Splendore-Hoeppli reaction. A Clostridium species was cultured from the tail abscess of the fourth iguana and recovered initially from another affected iguana that later yielded Neisseria; Clostridium was considered to be a wound contaminant. The mouths of the living rhinoceros iguanas and of both healthy and abscessed common iguanas were cultured, and 50% were found to be oral carriers of Neisseria. All isolates of Neisseria were the same species, but did not correspond to any currently described species. Common iguanas were successfully treated by tail amputation, but debridement followed by local and parenteral antibiotic therapy was associated with delayed healing and incomplete resolution of the lesions.
10.2307/20094856|An interstitial cell tumor is reported in a California desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizi). This case is unusual because testicular tumors have rarely been reported in reptiles.
10.2307/20460158|A brief summary of chemical immobilization of moose in North America is made. This looks at the various methods of approach, the weapons used and the drugs used. Most of the data available on successful moose capture refers to either succinylcholine chloride or etorphine hydrochloride. Preliminary results on a combination of fentanyl citrate and xylazine hydrochloride used for the immobilization of 47 moose are given. The animals were darted from a helicopter with Cap-Chur projectile syringes fired from the extra long-range projector. A dosage between 0.14 mg and 0.53 mg/kg of fentanyl and 0.15 to 0.53 mg/kg of xylazine provided satisfactory Immobilization. Hyaluronidase was added to the mixture on 24 occasions. This had the effect of reducing the induction time between 36 and 45%. The injection site was also found to affect the speed of induction, injections over the heavy muscle masses of shoulder and hind limb producing more rapid immobilization than in other sites. A major factor in successful moose capture from a helicopter was the experience, or lack thereof, of the pilot in this type of work.
10.2307/20094891|Squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea was diagnosed in an adult female cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). No cases have previously been diagnosed in a nondomestic felid. Because diffuse infiltration of the tumor was suspected, an exenteration of the left orbit was performed. Postoperative complications included bleeding from the incision site and inability to administer medicants orally because of inappetence. By postoperative day 4, the cheetah started eating and subsequently recovered uneventfully.
10.2307/20094493|Hematology and serum chemistry profiles for giraffes are presented. Values for 39 blood samples, collected from 14 giraffes, were analyzed and evaluated for variations relating to differences in sex, age, and restraint mode. Sex-specific variations were found in WBC and neutrophil numbers, total protein, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Age-specific variations were found in hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocytes, banded neutrophil and basophil numbers, and in calcium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine concentrations. Variations relating to differences in restraint mode used to collect the blood samples were found in calcium and uric acid concentrations.
10.2307/20094890|A 23-yr-old, male Sumatran orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus abelii) died suddenly and at necropsy had peritoneal and pericardial effusions, cardiac dilatation with a pale mottled myocardium, and pulmonary edema and congestion. There was subacute interstitial myocarditis with extensive involvement of the conduction system. Encephalomyocarditis virus was isolated in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells from a suspension of the affected myocardium.
20460133|Serial blood chemistry (Ca,P, BUN, uric acid, cholesterol, bilirubin, alkaline phosphotase, LDH, SGOT, TP, albumin, globulin, alpha 1 globulin, alpha 2 globulin, beta globulin, gamma globulin, (Ca:P and A:G) and hematology values (PCV and Hb) with excitability and condition classes were obtained from 5 adult wild female moose, 4 adult wild male moose, 1 tame adult female mooise, and 1 semi-tame adult castrated male moose from May, 1972 to January, 1975 at the Kenai Moose Research Center, Alaska. Condition related blood criteria based upon population sampling (PCV, Hb, Ca, P, TP, glucose, albumin, and beta globulin) were compared with individual serial sampled moose and, and in general, they reflected condition classes which corresponded to seaasons (lower values in late winter-spring and higher values in fall). Exceptions to this were noted. Blood urea nitrogen levels reflected seasonal variability in protein intake. Lactic dehydrogenase and SGOT values did not correspond to excitability classes as was anticipated. These data demonstrated some expected trends based upon population blood studies; however, they also indicated that individual variability influenced blood values and inferred population criteria must be based upon adequate sampling. Other parameters presented which were not specificall discussed may provide useful comparative data for other purposes and are presented for that reason.
10.2307/20094875|Dysgerminomas were observed in two red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), representing the first report of this neoplasm in reptiles. Although the turtles shared the same environment, they were unrelated and the etiology of this tumor in these two turtles is not known.
10.2307/20094889|Of the four most common techniques used to capture desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), net-gun capture generally causes fewer and lower-level stress-mediated shifts in physiological and biochemical parameters, the lowest mortality rate, and the lowest combined morbidity and mortality rate. Only one of 137 (0.7%) bighorn sheep net-gun captured between 1983 and 1986 showed signs of capture myopathy, and two (1.5%) died of injuries. Although net-gunning was found to be the safest method for capturing bighorn sheep, it does pose some serious hazards to the human user. Accidental discharge of the net-gun inside the helicopter, toward the main or rear rotor, or onto the skid can cause the helicopter to crash. Cost of net-gunning compared favorably with other methods of capture when the initial investment was amortized over 20 or more animals. An additional cost consideration is the versatility of the net-gun, as it can be used to capture several large mammals and birds.
10.2307/20460252|The hearts of a full-term fetus and an adult Indian one horned rhinoceros were studied. Although the gross anatomical features of the rhino heart generally resembled those of the hearts of the elephant, Asiatic buffalo, goat, and other domestic animals, there were differences in the biometrics.
10.2307/20094895|Two captive sloths (Cholepus sp.) developed cystic calculi, one resulting in a rectal prolapse secondary to stranguria. Both animals underwent cystotomy and systemic antibiotic therapy, and their dietary protein level was reduced. No medical problems related to these conditions have developed since the sloths were treated and their diet modified.
10.2307/20094894|An 18-yr-old male tiger died of massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage from a retroperitoneal paraganglioma. Incidental finding was a renal cystadenoma.
10.2307/20094872|A captive-raised snow leopard (Panthera uncia) was found to have mandibular osteomyelitis. Both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the infection site. Surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy with cefadroxil were used to successfully treat the infection. A mandibular fracture and canine and premolar tooth abscesses developed postoperatively and delayed recovery.
10.2307/20094849|Seventeen cases of Actinomyces pyogenes infections occurred in six species of captive Bovidae and Cervidae from 1978 to 1986. Infected animals included two yellow-backed duikers (Cephalophus sylvicultor), one white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus albojubatus), one scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), eight dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas), three Reeve's muntjacs (Muntiacus reevesi), and two reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Actinomyces pyogenes was isolated exclusively from external abscesses (mandible, hoof, and other cutaneous sites) in 12 animals and from urine, blood, and abscesses of the kidneys, lungs, and liver in five animals.
10.2307/20094892|A female snow leopard (Panthera uncia) underwent surgical removal of a 1.025-kg ovarian mass determined histologically to be a dysgerminoma. This is the second report of a primordial germ cell tumor in a snow leopard.
10.2307/20094887|Epididymal spermatozoa were harvested from a gaur (Bos gaurus) bull that had been euthanized 27 hr previously. The testes and attached epididymides were sent to the Cryogenics Laboratory, Iowa State University. Spermatozoa were removed from the distal portion of both ductus deferentia and cauda epididymides. Following equilibration in an egg yolk-buffer extender, the spermatozoa were packaged in straws, frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Postthaw analysis of motility indicated a significant degree of spermatozoal survival. A Holstein cow in estrus was inseminated twice with 80  10 spermatozoa to test the ability of the spermatozoa to undergo capacitation, zona penetration, membrane fusion, embryogenesis, and placentation. Pregnancy was verified by ultrasound 41 days postinsemination.
10.2307/20094896|A long-term captive Peruvian red-tail boa constrictor (Boa constrictor ortoni) exhibited anorexia and weight loss prior to sudden death. An undifferentiated carcinoma with characteristics of a granulosa cell tumor was identified. Metastasis was manifested as nodules embedded in paraovarian mesentery and the surface of the liver. The popularity of boa constrictors as zoological display animals and relative scarcity of ovarian neoplasms in snakes warrants reporting of the case.
10.2307/20460239|A study was undertaken at Edinburgh Zoo to investigate gastrointestinal nematodiasis in blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) involving Camelostrongylus mentulatus and to a lesser extent Nematodirus spathiger. Camelostrongylus mentulatus was associated with chronic emaciation and the death of a subdominant adult male animal following fighting. It was found to overwinter as infective larvae on pasture, and circumstantial evidence suggests that it may also do so as adults and arrested larvae within the blackbuck. Control was not achieved until anthelmintics were given monthly from June onward. This regime successfully reduced fecal egg counts and pasture larvae of C. mentulatus, but numbers of N. spathiger larvae on pasture were unaffected and reached a peak in mid-August. The possible factors involved in this infection and their impact on neonatal viability are briefly discussed.
10.2307/20094866|Serum levels of gentamicin were measured at various times in juvenile Markhor goats (Capra falconeri) following intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) dosing at 5 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from the time-concentration curves obtained. For the i.v. administration route, the data were best modelled by a biexponential curve. The first phase (distribution) and the second phase (elimination) half-lives averaged (SEM) 29  5 min and 1.9  0.2 hr, respectively. The steady-state volume of distribution (
10.2307/20094884|Enactment of animal welfare legislation and the characteristics these laws have taken parallel the evolution of the animal welfare and humane movement. As we move into the 21st century, zoological collections, wildlife management activities, and the entire spectrum of captive animal management will be challenged to meet new standards.
10.2307/20094864|Medetomidine- and ketamine-induced immobilization were studied clinically and by serial evaluations and determinations in 18 captive Markhors (Capra falconeri megaceros) on 21 occasions. Medetomidine and ketamine induced reliable immobilization with good muscle relaxation at mean doses of 69.0 g/kg and 1.60 mg/kg, respectively. In six Markhors, serial recordings and determinations were done at 10, 30, 45, and 60 min after darting. During the immobilization period, most clinical, hematological, and serum chemistry parameters remained within physiological limits, although there were statistically significant decreases in heart rates, rectal temperatures, packed cell volumes, and in serum aspartate aminotransferase, Na, Cl, and Ca levels. Significant increases in glucose levels were detected in EDTA blood and serum samples. Respiratory rates, leukocyte counts, and serum creatine kinase, urea, K, and inorganic phosphate levels remained stable. Atipamezole given by i.v., i.m., and i.v. +i.m. injections (mean doses 296.7, 323.0, and 287.7 g/kg, respectively) was used to reverse the medetomidine- and ketamine-induced immobilization. Atipamezole induced rapid, calm, and persistent reversal in most animals. Markhors were able to walk in a directed manner within 1-7 min.
10.2307/20094893|An adult female tiger (Panthera tigris) was euthanized for a widely metastatic complex mammary carcinoma. Gross metastases were found in the lungs, liver, spleen, diaphragm, adrenals, and in regional, thoracic, and abdominal lymph nodes. Microscopic metastases were found in ovaries, wall of the uterus, pancreas, a renal glomerulus, and periaortic lymphatics. The tumor consisted of myoepithelial cells and adenocarcinomatous cells with squamous metaplasia. The metastases showed regional predominance of distinct cytological patterns. Uterine mucosal hyperplasia was probably the result of progestagens administered for estrus control.
